The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

For the earlier period, see  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954) .          Prominent figures of the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Top left:  W. E. B. Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.     After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).

Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 1 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 2 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 3 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 4 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 5 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 8 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 9 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 10 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 11 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 12 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [2]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 15 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 16 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 17 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 18 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 19 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 21 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 16 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 4 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 23 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 24 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 25 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [3] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 27 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 4 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 28 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 29 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 30 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [4]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 31 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 32 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .

Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 33 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 34 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 35 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 36 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 38 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, shopping, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1967. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .   wayyy .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551965) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination towards black people  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Board of Education of Topeka, Kans. , unanimously agreeing that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. The ruling paves the way for large-scale desegregation. The decision overturns the 1896  Plessy  v.  Ferguson  ruling that sanctioned ""separate but equal"" segregation of the races, ruling that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."" It is a victory for  NAACP  attorney  Thurgood Marshall , who will later return to the Supreme Court as the nation's first black justice.  Top          1955       Aug.   Fourteen-year-old Chicagoan  Emmett Till  is visiting family in Mississippi when he is kidnapped, brutally beaten, shot, and dumped in the Tallahatchie River for allegedly whistling at a white woman. Two white men, J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant, are arrested for the murder and acquitted by an all-white jury. They later boast about committing the murder in a  Look  magazine interview. The case becomes a cause célèbre of the civil rights movement.       Dec. 1   ( Montgomery, Ala. ) NAACP member  Rosa Parks  refuses to give up her seat at the front of the ""colored section"" of a bus to a white passenger, defying a southern custom of the time. In response to her arrest the Montgomery black community launches a bus boycott, which will last for more than a year, until the buses are desegregated Dec. 21, 1956. As newly elected president of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), Reverend  Martin Luther King, Jr. , is instrumental in leading the boycott.    Top        1957       Jan.–Feb.   Martin Luther King,  Charles K. Steele , and  Fred L. Shuttlesworth  establish the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, of which King is made the first president. The SCLC becomes a major force in organizing the civil rights movement and bases its principles on nonviolence and civil disobedience. According to King, it is essential that the civil rights movement not sink to the level of the racists and hatemongers who oppose them: ""We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline,"" he urges.      Sept.   ( Little Rock, Ark. ) Formerly all-white Central High School learns that  integration  is easier said than done. Nine black students are blocked from entering the school on the orders of Governor  Orval Faubus .  President Eisenhower  sends federal troops and the National Guard to intervene on behalf of the students, who become known as the "" Little Rock Nine .""        1960       Feb. 1   ( Greensboro, N.C. )  Four black students  from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College begin a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter. Although they are refused service, they are allowed to stay at the counter. The event triggers many similar nonviolent protests throughout the South. Six months later the original four protesters are served lunch at the same Woolworth's counter. Student sit-ins would be effective throughout the Deep South in integrating parks, swimming pools, theaters,  libraries, and other public facilities.    April   ( Raleigh, N.C. ) The  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) is founded at Shaw University, providing young blacks with a place in the civil rights movement. The SNCC later grows into a more radical organization, especially under the leadership of  Stokely Carmichael  (1966–1967). Top        1961       May 4   Over the spring and summer, student volunteers begin taking bus trips through the South to test out new laws that prohibit segregation in interstate travel facilities, which includes bus and railway stations. Several of the groups of "" freedom riders ,"" as they are called, are attacked by angry mobs along the way. The program, sponsored by  The Congress of Racial Equality  (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), involves more than 1,000 volunteers, black and white.               1962         Oct. 1   James Meredith  becomes the first black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi. Violence and riots surrounding the incident cause President Kennedy to send 5,000 federal troops.             1963          April 16   Martin Luther King is arrested and jailed during anti-segregation protests in Birmingham, Ala.; he writes his seminal "" Letter from  Birmingham Jail ,"" arguing that individuals have the moral duty to disobey unjust laws.     May   During civil rights protests in Birmingham, Ala., Commissioner of Public Safety Eugene ""Bull"" Connor uses fire hoses and police dogs on black demonstrators. These images of brutality, which are televised and published widely, are instrumental in gaining sympathy for the civil rights movement around the world.     June 12   ( Jackson, Miss. ) Mississippi's NAACP field secretary, 37-year-old  Medgar Evers , is murdered outside his home. Byron De La Beckwith is tried twice in 1964, both trials resulting in hung juries. Thirty years later he is  convicted for murdering Evers .     Aug. 28   ( Washington, D.C. ) About 200,000 people join the  March on Washington . Congregating at the  Lincoln  Memorial, participants listen as Martin Luther King delivers his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech.    Sept. 15   ( Birmingham, Ala. ) Four young girls (Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Addie Mae Collins) attending Sunday school are  killed when a bomb explodes  at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, a popular location for civil rights meetings. Riots erupt in Birmingham, leading to the deaths of two more black youths. Top              1964       Jan. 23    The 24th Amendment abolishes the poll tax, which originally had been instituted in 11 southern states after Reconstruction to make it difficult for poor blacks to vote.     Summer   The Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a network of civil rights groups that includes CORE and SNCC, launches a massive effort to register black voters during what becomes known as the Freedom Summer. It also sends delegates to the  Democratic National Convention  to protest—and attempt to unseat—the official all-white Mississippi contingent.    July 2     President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 . The most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination of all kinds based on race, color, religion, or national origin. The law also provides the federal government with the powers to enforce desegregation.     Aug. 4   (Neshoba Country, Miss.) The bodies of  three civil-rights workers —two white, one black—are found in an earthen dam, six weeks into a federal investigation backed by  President Johnson . James E. Chaney, 21; Andrew Goodman, 21; and Michael Schwerner, 24, had been working to register black voters in Mississippi, and, on June 21, had gone to investigate the burning of a black church. They were arrested by the police on speeding charges, incarcerated for several hours, and then released after dark into the hands of the  Ku Klux Klan , who murdered them.        1965       Feb. 21   ( Harlem, N.Y. )  Malcolm X , black nationalist and founder of the Organization of Afro-American Unity, is shot to death. It is believed the assailants are members of the  Black Muslim  faith, which Malcolm had recently abandoned in favor of orthodox Islam.     March 7   ( Selma, Ala. ) Blacks begin a march to Montgomery in support of voting rights but are stopped at the Pettus Bridge by a police blockade. Fifty marchers are hospitalized after police use tear gas, whips, and clubs against them. The incident is dubbed ""Bloody Sunday"" by the media. The march is considered the catalyst for pushing through the voting rights act five months later.      Aug. 10   Congress passes the Voting Rights Act of 1965, making it easier for Southern blacks to register to vote. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and other such requirements that were used to restrict black voting are made illegal.        Aug. 11–17, 1965    ( Watts, Calif. ) Race riots erupt in a black section of Los Angeles.       Sept. 24, 1965    Asserting that civil rights laws alone are not enough to remedy discrimination,  President Johnson   issues Executive Order 11246, which enforces affirmative action for the first time.  It requires government contractors to ""take affirmative action"" toward prospective minority employees in all aspects of hiring and employment. Top             1966                              Oct.   ( Oakland, Calif. ) The militant  Black Panthers  are founded by  Huey Newton  and  Bobby Seale .         1967         April 19     Stokely Carmichael , a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), coins the phrase ""black power"" in a speech in Seattle. He defines it as an assertion of black pride and ""the coming together of black people to fight for their liberation by any means necessary."" The term's radicalism alarms many who believe the civil rights movement's effectiveness and moral authority crucially depend on nonviolent civil disobedience.      June 12   In  Loving  v.  Virginia , the Supreme Court rules that prohibiting interracial marriage is unconstitutional. Sixteen states that still banned interracial marriage at the time are forced to revise their laws.    July    Major race riots take place in Newark (July 12–16) and Detroit (July 23–30).             1968       April 4   ( Memphis, Tenn. ) Martin Luther King, at age 39, is shot as he stands on the balcony outside his hotel room. Escaped convict and committed racist  James Earl Ray    is convicted of the crime.               April 11   President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , prohibiting discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing.           1971       April 20   The  Supreme Court , in  Swann  v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education , upholds busing as a legitimate means for achieving  integration  of public schools.  Although largely unwelcome (and sometimes violently opposed) in local school districts, court-ordered busing plans in cities such as Charlotte, Boston, and Denver continue until the late 1990s. Top           1988       March 22   Overriding  President Reagan's  veto, Congress passes the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which expands the reach of non-discrimination laws within private institutions receiving federal funds.           1991       Nov. 22   After two years of debates, vetoes, and threatened vetoes,  President Bush  reverses himself and signs the Civil Rights Act of 1991, strengthening existing civil rights laws and providing for damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination. Top            1992       April 29   ( Los Angeles, Calif. ) The first race riots in decades erupt in south-central Los Angeles after a jury acquits four white police officers for the videotaped beating of African American Rodney King.        2003       June 23    In the most important affirmative action decision since the 1978  Bakke  case, the Supreme Court (5–4) upholds the University of Michigan Law School's policy, ruling that race can be one of many factors considered by colleges when selecting their students because it furthers ""a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.""   ( See also :  Affirmative Action Timeline .)   Top           2005       June 21    The ringleader of the  Mississippi civil rights murders  (see  Aug. 4, 1964 ),  Edgar Ray Killen , is convicted of manslaughter on the 41st anniversary of the crimes.    October 24    Rosa Parks dies at age 92.            2006       January 30    Coretta Scott King dies of a stroke at age 78.            2007       February    Emmett Till's 1955 murder case, reopened by the Department of Justice in 2004, is officially closed. The two confessed murderers, J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant, were dead of cancer by 1994, and prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to pursue further convictions.    May 10    James Bonard Fowler, a former state trooper, is indicted for the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson 40 years after Jackson's death. The 1965 killing lead to a series of historic civil rights protests in Selma, Ala.

Board of Education of Topeka, Kans. , unanimously agreeing that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. The ruling paves the way for large-scale desegregation. The decision overturns the 1896  Plessy  v.  Ferguson  ruling that sanctioned ""separate but equal"" segregation of the races, ruling that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."" It is a victory for  NAACP  attorney  Thurgood Marshall , who will later return to the Supreme Court as the nation's first black justice.  Top          1955       Aug.   Fourteen-year-old Chicagoan  Emmett Till  is visiting family in Mississippi when he is kidnapped, brutally beaten, shot, and dumped in the Tallahatchie River for allegedly whistling at a white woman. Two white men, J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant, are arrested for the murder and acquitted by an all-white jury. They later boast about committing the murder in a  Look  magazine interview. The case becomes a cause célèbre of the civil rights movement.       Dec. 1   ( Montgomery, Ala. ) NAACP member  Rosa Parks  refuses to give up her seat at the front of the ""colored section"" of a bus to a white passenger, defying a southern custom of the time. In response to her arrest the Montgomery black community launches a bus boycott, which will last for more than a year, until the buses are desegregated Dec. 21, 1956. As newly elected president of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), Reverend  Martin Luther King, Jr. , is instrumental in leading the boycott.    Top        1957       Jan.–Feb.   Martin Luther King,  Charles K. Steele , and  Fred L. Shuttlesworth  establish the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, of which King is made the first president. The SCLC becomes a major force in organizing the civil rights movement and bases its principles on nonviolence and civil disobedience. According to King, it is essential that the civil rights movement not sink to the level of the racists and hatemongers who oppose them: ""We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline,"" he urges.      Sept.   ( Little Rock, Ark. ) Formerly all-white Central High School learns that  integration  is easier said than done. Nine black students are blocked from entering the school on the orders of Governor  Orval Faubus .  President Eisenhower  sends federal troops and the National Guard to intervene on behalf of the students, who become known as the "" Little Rock Nine .""        1960       Feb. 1   ( Greensboro, N.C. )  Four black students  from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College begin a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter. Although they are refused service, they are allowed to stay at the counter. The event triggers many similar nonviolent protests throughout the South. Six months later the original four protesters are served lunch at the same Woolworth's counter. Student sit-ins would be effective throughout the Deep South in integrating parks, swimming pools, theaters,  libraries, and other public facilities.    April   ( Raleigh, N.C. ) The  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) is founded at Shaw University, providing young blacks with a place in the civil rights movement. The SNCC later grows into a more radical organization, especially under the leadership of  Stokely Carmichael  (1966–1967). Top        1961       May 4   Over the spring and summer, student volunteers begin taking bus trips through the South to test out new laws that prohibit segregation in interstate travel facilities, which includes bus and railway stations. Several of the groups of "" freedom riders ,"" as they are called, are attacked by angry mobs along the way. The program, sponsored by  The Congress of Racial Equality  (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), involves more than 1,000 volunteers, black and white.               1962         Oct. 1   James Meredith  becomes the first black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi. Violence and riots surrounding the incident cause President Kennedy to send 5,000 federal troops.             1963          April 16   Martin Luther King is arrested and jailed during anti-segregation protests in Birmingham, Ala.; he writes his seminal "" Letter from  Birmingham Jail ,"" arguing that individuals have the moral duty to disobey unjust laws.     May   During civil rights protests in Birmingham, Ala., Commissioner of Public Safety Eugene ""Bull"" Connor uses fire hoses and police dogs on black demonstrators. These images of brutality, which are televised and published widely, are instrumental in gaining sympathy for the civil rights movement around the world.     June 12   ( Jackson, Miss. ) Mississippi's NAACP field secretary, 37-year-old  Medgar Evers , is murdered outside his home. Byron De La Beckwith is tried twice in 1964, both trials resulting in hung juries. Thirty years later he is  convicted for murdering Evers .     Aug. 28   ( Washington, D.C. ) About 200,000 people join the  March on Washington . Congregating at the  Lincoln  Memorial, participants listen as Martin Luther King delivers his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech.    Sept. 15   ( Birmingham, Ala. ) Four young girls (Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Addie Mae Collins) attending Sunday school are  killed when a bomb explodes  at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, a popular location for civil rights meetings. Riots erupt in Birmingham, leading to the deaths of two more black youths. Top              1964       Jan. 23    The 24th Amendment abolishes the poll tax, which originally had been instituted in 11 southern states after Reconstruction to make it difficult for poor blacks to vote.     Summer   The Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a network of civil rights groups that includes CORE and SNCC, launches a massive effort to register black voters during what becomes known as the Freedom Summer. It also sends delegates to the  Democratic National Convention  to protest—and attempt to unseat—the official all-white Mississippi contingent.    July 2     President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 . The most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination of all kinds based on race, color, religion, or national origin. The law also provides the federal government with the powers to enforce desegregation.     Aug. 4   (Neshoba Country, Miss.) The bodies of  three civil-rights workers —two white, one black—are found in an earthen dam, six weeks into a federal investigation backed by  President Johnson . James E. Chaney, 21; Andrew Goodman, 21; and Michael Schwerner, 24, had been working to register black voters in Mississippi, and, on June 21, had gone to investigate the burning of a black church. They were arrested by the police on speeding charges, incarcerated for several hours, and then released after dark into the hands of the  Ku Klux Klan , who murdered them.        1965       Feb. 21   ( Harlem, N.Y. )  Malcolm X , black nationalist and founder of the Organization of Afro-American Unity, is shot to death. It is believed the assailants are members of the  Black Muslim  faith, which Malcolm had recently abandoned in favor of orthodox Islam.     March 7   ( Selma, Ala. ) Blacks begin a march to Montgomery in support of voting rights but are stopped at the Pettus Bridge by a police blockade. Fifty marchers are hospitalized after police use tear gas, whips, and clubs against them. The incident is dubbed ""Bloody Sunday"" by the media. The march is considered the catalyst for pushing through the voting rights act five months later.      Aug. 10   Congress passes the Voting Rights Act of 1965, making it easier for Southern blacks to register to vote. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and other such requirements that were used to restrict black voting are made illegal.        Aug. 11–17, 1965    ( Watts, Calif. ) Race riots erupt in a black section of Los Angeles.       Sept. 24, 1965    Asserting that civil rights laws alone are not enough to remedy discrimination,  President Johnson   issues Executive Order 11246, which enforces affirmative action for the first time.  It requires government contractors to ""take affirmative action"" toward prospective minority employees in all aspects of hiring and employment. Top             1966                              Oct.   ( Oakland, Calif. ) The militant  Black Panthers  are founded by  Huey Newton  and  Bobby Seale .         1967         April 19     Stokely Carmichael , a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), coins the phrase ""black power"" in a speech in Seattle. He defines it as an assertion of black pride and ""the coming together of black people to fight for their liberation by any means necessary."" The term's radicalism alarms many who believe the civil rights movement's effectiveness and moral authority crucially depend on nonviolent civil disobedience.      June 12   In  Loving  v.  Virginia , the Supreme Court rules that prohibiting interracial marriage is unconstitutional. Sixteen states that still banned interracial marriage at the time are forced to revise their laws.    July    Major race riots take place in Newark (July 12–16) and Detroit (July 23–30).             1968       April 4   ( Memphis, Tenn. ) Martin Luther King, at age 39, is shot as he stands on the balcony outside his hotel room. Escaped convict and committed racist James Earl Ray   is convicted of the crime.               April 11   President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , prohibiting discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing.           1971       April 20   The  Supreme Court , in  Swann  v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education , upholds busing as a legitimate means for achieving  integration  of public schools.  Although largely unwelcome (and sometimes violently opposed) in local school districts, court-ordered busing plans in cities such as Charlotte, Boston, and Denver continue until the late 1990s. Top           1988       March 22   Overriding  President Reagan's  veto, Congress passes the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which expands the reach of non-discrimination laws within private institutions receiving federal funds.           1991       Nov. 22   After two years of debates, vetoes, and threatened vetoes,  President Bush  reverses himself and signs the Civil Rights Act of 1991, strengthening existing civil rights laws and providing for damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination. Top            1992       April 29   ( Los Angeles, Calif. ) The first race riots in decades erupt in south-central Los Angeles after a jury acquits four white police officers for the videotaped beating of African American Rodney King.        2003       June 23    In the most important affirmative action decision since the 1978  Bakke  case, the Supreme Court (5–4) upholds the University of Michigan Law School's policy, ruling that race can be one of many factors considered by colleges when selecting their students because it furthers ""a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.""   ( See also :  Affirmative Action Timeline .)   Top           2005       June 21    The ringleader of the  Mississippi civil rights murders  (see  Aug. 4, 1964 ),  Edgar Ray Killen , is convicted of manslaughter on the 41st anniversary of the crimes.    October 24    Rosa Parks dies at age 92.            2006       January 30    Coretta Scott King dies of a stroke at age 78.            2007       February    Emmett Till's 1955 murder case, reopened by the Department of Justice in 2004, is officially closed. The two confessed murderers, J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant, were dead of cancer by 1994, and prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to pursue further convictions.    May 10    James Bonard Fowler, a former state trooper, is indicted for the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson 40 years after Jackson's death. The 1965 killing lead to a series of historic civil rights protests in Selma, Ala.

Ben Werner, Student Newspaper Editor                 The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s forced federal and state governments to remove the shackles of legal segregation and to give blacks in the southern states access to the ballot box.  He was part of the Civil Rights Movement during the 60's where he participated in peaceful marches and demonstrations throughout the United States with Dr.  The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and '60s led to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination and segregation in voting, education, and the use of public facilities.                                                                                                               John Carthy, Gun Shop Sales Assistant                 This movement was started by Coach Bill McCartney, who also spear-headed the Amendment 2 initiative in Colorado that would have denied civil rights to gay people.  Here there is a kind of freedom movement not altogether unlike the original civil-rights movement in which democratic principles were also used to break up a racialist hegemony.                                                                                                               Jack Crawford, WWII Veteran                 Dart was a leader in the disability rights movement for three decades and had received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work in civil rights.  Not even the Civil Rights movement and the Viet Nam War and their protests made all this clear for me.  The Civil Rights Movement At the end of World War II, black Americans were poised to make far-reaching demands to end racism.                                                                                                               David Rosenberg, Dermatologist                 The civil rights movement must continue today as immigrants, especially Arabs and Arab look-alikes are victims of prejudice.

This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.

Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was allegedly harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Alba  "

Civil Rights Movement  (redirected from  Civil rights movements )      Also found in:  Encyclopedia ,  Wikipedia  0.02 sec.         The civil rights movement was a struggle by African Americans in the mid-1950s to late 1960s to achieve  Civil Rights  equal to those of whites, including equal opportunity in employment, housing, and education, as well as the right to vote, the right of equal access to public facilities, and the right to be free of  racial discrimination . No social or political movement of the twentieth century has had as profound an effect on the legal and political institutions of the United States. This movement sought to restore to African Americans the rights of citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which had been eroded by segregationist  Jim Crow Laws  in the South. It fundamentally altered relations between the federal government and the states, as the federal government was forced many times to enforce its laws and protect the rights of African American citizens. The civil rights movement also spurred the reemergence of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, in its role as protector of individual liberties against majority power. In addition, as the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr, and other leaders of the movement predicted, the movement prompted gains not only for African Americans but also for women, persons with disabilities, and many others.   The civil rights movement has been called the Second Reconstruction, in reference to the Reconstruction imposed upon the South following the Civil War. During this period, the  Fourteenth Amendment  (1868)—granting  Equal Protection  of the laws—and  Fifteenth Amendment  (1870)—giving the right to vote to all males regardless of race—were ratified, and troops from the North occupied the South from 1865 to 1877 to enforce the  Abolition  of  Slavery . However, with the end of Reconstruction in 1877, southern whites again took control of the South, passing a variety of laws that discriminated on the basis of race. These were called Jim Crow laws, or the  Black Codes . They segregated whites and blacks in education, housing, and the use of public and private facilities such as restaurants, trains, and rest rooms; they also denied blacks the right to vote, to move freely, and to marry whites. Myriad other prejudicial and discriminatory practices were committed as well, from routine denial of the right to a fair trial to outright murder by  Lynching . These laws and practices were a reality of U.S. life well into the twentieth century.   Organized efforts by African Americans to gain their civil rights began well before the official civil rights movement got under way. By 1909, blacks and whites together had formed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ), which became a leading ing organization in the cause of civil rights for African Americans. From its beginning, the NAACP and its attorneys challenged many discriminatory laws in court, but it was not until after  World War II  that a widespread movement for civil rights gathered force.   The war itself contributed to the origins of the movement. When African Americans who had fought for their country returned home, they more openly resisted being treated as second-class citizens. The movement's first major legal victory came in 1954, when the NAACP won  brown v. board of education of topeka, kansas,  347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873, in which the Supreme Court struck down laws segregating white and black children into different public elementary schools. With  Brown , it became apparent that African Americans had important allies in the highest federal court and its chief justice,  Earl Warren .   The Birth of the Civil Rights Movement   On December 1, 1955,  rosa parks  was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man. News of Parks's arrest quickly spread through the African American community. Parks had worked as a secretary for the local branch of the  national association for the advancement of colored people . Because she was a well-respected and dignified figure in the community, her arrest was finally enough to persuade African Americans that they could no longer tolerate racially discriminatory laws.   After exchanging phone calls, a group of African American women, the Women's Political Council, decided to call for a boycott of the city buses as a response to this outrage. This suggestion was greeted with enthusiasm by local African American leaders, including the influential black clergy.   On December 5, members of the African American community rallied at the Holt Street Baptist Church in Montgomery and decided to carry out the boycott. Their resolve was inspired by the words of the Reverend  martin luther king jr.   ""We are here this evening,"" King declared to the packed church, ""to say to those who have mistreated us so long that we are tired—tired of being segregated and humiliated; tired of being kicked about by the brutal feet of oppression."" He went on to make a case for peace and nonviolence. Contrasting the methods of nonviolence that he envisioned for a civil rights movement, to the methods of violence used by the racist and terrorist  Ku Klux Klan , King declared,     in our protest there will be no cross burnings…. We will be guided by the highest principles of law and order. Our method will be that of persuasion, not coercion. We will only say to the people, ""Let conscience be your guide"" … [O]ur actions must be guided by the deepest principles of our Christian faith. Love must be our regulating ideal. Once again we must hear the words of Jesus echoing across the centuries: ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you.""     With these words and these events, the long, difficult struggle of the  Civil Rights  movement began.   Another catalyzing event occurred on December 1, 1955, when  rosa parks , an African American woman, was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus. The law required African Americans to sit in the back of city buses and to give up their seats to whites should the white section of the bus become full. The city's black residents, long tired of the indignities of  Segregation , began a boycott of city buses. They recruited King, a 27-year-old preacher, to head the Montgomery Improvement Association, the group which organized the boycott. The African Americans of Montgomery held out for nearly a year despite violence—including the bombing of King's home—directed at them by angry whites. This violence was repugnant to many whites and actually increased support for the civil rights movement among them. The boycott finally achieved its goal on November 13, 1956, when the Supreme Court, in  Gayle v.   Million Man March   On Monday, October 16, 1995, hundreds of thousands of African American men gathered on the Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Million Man March, a daylong rally promoting personal responsibility and racial solidarity. Organized by Louis Farrakhan, leader of the  Nation of Islam , the march was one of the most well attended and significant rallies in the history of the nation's capital. With its mass of men stretching from the Capitol steps to the Washington Monument, the gathering marked a renewed commitment to self-empowerment and betterment on the part of African Americans.   The Million Man March deliberately recalled the 1963 March on Washington, which many consider the high point of the civil rights movement. During that earlier gathering, the Reverend  martin luther king jr. , gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Many speakers at the Million Man March invoked King's speech, noting with a combination of sorrow, anger, and penitence that King's dreams for a racially united America had not yet been realized.   Farrakhan gave the keynote address of the day. Flanked by members of his paramilitary group, the Fruit of Islam, and speaking from behind a bullet-proof shield, he announced at the beginning of his speech, ""We are gathered here to collect ourselves for a responsibility that God is placing on our shoulders to move this nation toward a more perfect union."" He continued to orate for over two hours, frequently bringing home the point that African Americans still suffer disadvantages that European Americans did not have. ""There's still two Americas,"" he declared, ""one black, one white, separate and unequal.""   In another significant speech, the Reverend  jesse jackson  expanded on the religiously inspired tone of repentance that was so much a part of the Million Man March. Speaking for those in attendance, the  Civil Rights  leader prayed for ""God to forgive us for our sins and the foolishness of our ways."" Like many of the other speakers, he called on African American men to take responsibility for their families, to end violence and drug use in the home and in their communities, and to make sure their children are learning in school. He had this to say about the current problems facing African Americans:     We come here today because there is a structural malfunction in America. It was structured in the Constitution, and they referred to us as three-fifths of a human being, legally…. Why do we march? Because our babies die earlier…. Why do we march? Because we're less able to get a primary or secondary education. Why do we march? Because the media stereotypes us. We are projected as less intelligent than we are; less hard-working than we work; less universal than we are; less patriotic than we are; and more violent than we are. Why do we march? We're less able to borrow money…. Why do we march? Because we're trapped with second-class schools and first-class jails.     Other speakers at the march included the Reverend Joseph Lowery; Damu Smith, of Greenpeace; poet Maya Angelou; and  rosa parks , whose arrest inspired the 1955  Montgomery Bus Boycott .   Away from the speakers' podium, the men collected on the Mall made their own history on that day. Coming from different classes, regions, and religions, they were a diverse group not beholden to any one leader. Many men remarked on the deep meaning the experience had for them, on the fellowship and friendships they gained, and on their own commitment to renewal and repair of both themselves and their communities.   One of the most contentious issues of all regarding the march was the attendance figure. The National Park Service officially estimated attendance at 400,000, whereas event organizers pegged it at over 1.5 million. In comparison, the 1963 March on Washington attracted 250,000 participants.   The Million Man March drew an extremely large share of the nation's television audience, as well as laudatory comments from many national leaders, including President  bill clinton  and former general Colin L. Powell.   Browder , 352 U.S. 903, 77 S. Ct. 145, declared Montgomery's bus segregation law unconstitutional. By December 1956, the city was forced to desegregate its buses.   Although African Americans had sporadically demonstrated against segregation laws in previous decades, the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  became a turning point for their protests. It gained significant media attention for the civil rights cause, and it brought King to the fore as a leader. King would go on to head the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference  (SCLC), which was formed in 1957, and to guide the civil rights movement itself. The boycott also marked the end of reliance on litigation as the major tactic for gaining civil rights for African Americans. From this point on the movement also engaged in nonviolent direct action, a technique of civil disobedience that had been used before by pacifists, by labor movements, and by Mohandas K. Gandhi in the struggle to secure India's freedom from Great Britain.   Nonviolent methods had been used by African Americans since the 1940s, when the  congress of racial equality  (CORE)—a group of blacks and whites that formed in 1942 to lobby for equal civil rights for all—organized nonviolent direct action to protest racial discrimination. King described his own view of nonviolent protest in his 1958 book  Stride toward Freedom.  This type of protest worked in part by seeking to create a sense of shame in the opponent.   The nonviolence of the civil rights movement and the power of the federal government over the states were tested as African Americans sought to make use of the rights that had been confirmed by the Supreme Court. For example, segregationist whites, including the Alabama legislature, refused to recognize the rulings of the federal judiciary regarding  School Desegregation . Some whites formed citizens' councils to combat desegregation, and the  Ku Klux Klan  and other reactionary whites began a campaign of  Terrorism , including bombings and murders, intended to intimidate African Americans into giving up their cause.   A significant state-federal confrontation occurred in 1957 at Little Rock, Arkansas's Central High School, when angry mobs of whites attacked nine black students attempting to enroll for classes. President  dwight d. eisenhower  had to send in troops to enforce the Supreme Court's decision in  Brown , confirming   the right of the students to attend the school. In 1962, when  james meredith  attempted to enroll at the University of Mississippi, President  john f. kennedy  also sent in federal military troops to uphold desegregation.   The SCLC, which under King's leadership had become one of the most important civil rights organizations in the country, in turn spawned another influential group, the  Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC, popularly called Snick). In 1960 this group, which was made up of both blacks and whites, became a major player in the civil rights struggle. SNCC attracted youths who were often dissatisfied by what they saw as the unnecessarily moderate goals and methods of the NAACP and the SCLC. SNCC members later led voting registration and education efforts throughout the South, often at great personal risk. Eventually, the group planted the seed of factionalism in the civil rights movement, as it became increasingly radical and alienated from the mainstream of the movement as represented by King.   SNCC played an influential role in another form of nonviolent direct action employed in the civil rights movement: sit-ins. These demonstrations often focused upon the whites-only lunch counters across the South. Armed only with a strict code of conduct that forbade them to strike back or curse their opponents, demonstrators endured jeers, spitting, and blows by angry whites. One tactic associated with this strategy was the jail-in—also called jail, no bail—in which hundreds of people, many of them underage youths, arrived in waves at segregated lunch counters, were arrested for trespassing, and proceeded to overcrowd local jails. Jail-ins bogged down local governments and drew national attention to the cause. In the North, activists responded by picketing businesses, including the Woolworth chain of stores that operated segregated lunch counters in the South. The right to participate in sit-ins was upheld by the Supreme Court decisions  Garner v. Louisiana , 368 U.S. 157, 82 S. Ct. 248, 7 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1961), and  Peterson v. City of Greenville , 373 U.S. 244, 83 S. Ct. 1119, 10 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1963).   The Freedom Rides were a type of nonviolent direct action designed to oppose segregation in interstate buses and bus stations. They were inspired in part by the 1960 Supreme Court decision  Boynton v. Virginia , 364 U.S. 459, 81 S. Ct. 182, 5 L. Ed. 2d 206, which outlawed racial segregation in bus terminals and other places of public accommodation related to interstate transportation. Organized by CORE in 1961, the Freedom Rides were undertaken by six whites and seven blacks who rode two interstate buses from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans. Along the way, the riders deliberately violated segregation policies on the buses and in bus terminal rest rooms, waiting areas, and restaurants. White mobs savagely beat Freedom Riders of both races at different stops in the Deep South and in Alabama, one of the buses was firebombed.   Although the 1961 Freedom Rides proceeded no farther than Jackson, Mississippi, they achieved their larger goal of inducing the federal government to enforce its laws. The administration of President Kennedy sent in  u.s. marshals  to protect the riders during the last part of their journey. An even clearer victory was achieved in September 1961 when the  Interstate Commerce Commission  abolished all segregated facilities in interstate transportation.   On August 28, 1963, the civil rights movement reached a high point of public visibility when it held the March on Washington. Hundreds of thousands of people—an estimated 20 to 30 percent of them white—gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., to urge Congress and the federal government to support desegregation and  voting rights . During this occasion, King gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.   The following summer, civil rights activists in Mississippi organized another highly publicized event, Freedom Summer, a campaign to bring one thousand students, both white and black, into the South to teach and organize voter registration. Many civil rights groups provided backing for this movement, including SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP.   Throughout this period of nonviolent protest, the civil rights movement continued to suffer the effects of white violence.  medgar evers , an NAACP leader who was organizing a black boycott in Jackson, was shot and killed outside his home in 1963. Three participants in Freedom Summer—James Chaney, an African American, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, both whites—were killed in Mississippi in June 1964. Events such as these murders outraged many in the nation and solidified popular support for the civil rights cause.   Then Congress passed one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation ever proposed, the  Civil Rights Act of 1964  (42 U.S.C.A. § 2000a et seq.). This act made Congress an equal partner with the Supreme Court in establishing civil rights. Title II of the act outlawed discrimination in all places of public accommodation, including restaurants and lunch counters, motels and hotels, gas stations, theaters, and sports arenas. It also allowed the  department of justice  to bring suit in order to achieve desegregation in public schools, relieving the NAACP of some of its civil rights litigation caseload. The following year, Congress   passed another important piece of legislation, the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  (42 U.S.C.A. § 1973 et seq.). This act outlawed the voting qualifications, including literacy tests, that whites had used to keep African Americans from voting. It also gave the federal government oversight powers regarding changes in state voting laws. These laws together with federal actions showed that the civil rights movement had the backing of the powers of the federal government and that no amount of resistance, however violent, by white southerners would impede the cause.   By the mid-1960s, the nature of the civil rights movement began to change. African Americans, who had been united in their support of activities such as the Montgomery bus boycott, began to diverge in their views over what political action should be taken to improve their situation. Members of different groups within the movement increasingly expressed their dissatisfaction with other groups. More radical groups, including the Black Muslims and black power proponents, voiced discontent with the limited goals of the civil rights movement and its advocacy of nonviolence.   Many of the new African American radicals called for black separatism or nationalism—that is, separation from white society rather than  Integration  with it. Not content merely to seek civil equality, they began to press for social and economic equality. They also questioned the usefulness of nonviolence and no longer sought to include whites in the movement. SNCC, for example, became an all-black organization in 1966. The arguments of the African American radicals were punctuated by urban riots such as those in the Watts section of Los Angeles in 1965.   By the late 1960s, African Americans still suffered from many disadvantages, including poverty rates that were much higher than those among whites and physical health that was much worse. Racially motivated violence persisted as well, as seen in the assassination of King by a white man in 1968.   Despite these problems, the civil rights movement had forever changed the face of U.S. law and politics. It had led to legislation that gave greater protection to the rights of minorities. It had also greatly changed the role of the judiciary in U.S. government, as the Supreme Court had become more active in its defense of individual rights, often in response to litigation and demonstrations initiated by those in the movement. In this respect, the Court and the civil rights movement had great influence on each other, with each reacting to and encouraging the efforts of the other. Likewise, the federal government had, even if hesitatingly, enforced the rights of a persecuted minority in the face of vigorous opposition from the southern states.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Civil Rights Movement       Also found in:  Dictionary/thesaurus ,  Encyclopedia ,  Wikipedia  0.07 sec.         The civil rights movement was a struggle by African Americans in the mid-1950s to late 1960s to achieve  Civil Rights  equal to those of whites, including equal opportunity in employment, housing, and education, as well as the right to vote, the right of equal access to public facilities, and the right to be free of  racial discrimination . No social or political movement of the twentieth century has had as profound an effect on the legal and political institutions of the United States. This movement sought to restore to African Americans the rights of citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which had been eroded by segregationist  Jim Crow Laws  in the South. It fundamentally altered relations between the federal government and the states, as the federal government was forced many times to enforce its laws and protect the rights of African American citizens. The civil rights movement also spurred the reemergence of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, in its role as protector of individual liberties against majority power. In addition, as the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr, and other leaders of the movement predicted, the movement prompted gains not only for African Americans but also for women, persons with disabilities, and many others.   The civil rights movement has been called the Second Reconstruction, in reference to the Reconstruction imposed upon the South following the Civil War. During this period, the  Fourteenth Amendment  (1868)—granting  Equal Protection  of the laws—and  Fifteenth Amendment  (1870)—giving the right to vote to all males regardless of race—were ratified, and troops from the North occupied the South from 1865 to 1877 to enforce the  Abolition  of  Slavery . However, with the end of Reconstruction in 1877, southern whites again took control of the South, passing a variety of laws that discriminated on the basis of race. These were called Jim Crow laws, or the  Black Codes . They segregated whites and blacks in education, housing, and the use of public and private facilities such as restaurants, trains, and rest rooms; they also denied blacks the right to vote, to move freely, and to marry whites. Myriad other prejudicial and discriminatory practices were committed as well, from routine denial of the right to a fair trial to outright murder by  Lynching . These laws and practices were a reality of U.S. life well into the twentieth century.   Organized efforts by African Americans to gain their civil rights began well before the official civil rights movement got under way. By 1909, blacks and whites together had formed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ), which became a leading ing organization in the cause of civil rights for African Americans. From its beginning, the NAACP and its attorneys challenged many discriminatory laws in court, but it was not until after  World War II  that a widespread movement for civil rights gathered force.   The war itself contributed to the origins of the movement. When African Americans who had fought for their country returned home, they more openly resisted being treated as second-class citizens. The movement's first major legal victory came in 1954, when the NAACP won  brown v. board of education of topeka, kansas,  347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873, in which the Supreme Court struck down laws segregating white and black children into different public elementary schools. With  Brown , it became apparent that African Americans had important allies in the highest federal court and its chief justice,  Earl Warren .   The Birth of the Civil Rights Movement   On December 1, 1955,  rosa parks  was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man. News of Parks's arrest quickly spread through the African American community. Parks had worked as a secretary for the local branch of the  national association for the advancement of colored people . Because she was a well-respected and dignified figure in the community, her arrest was finally enough to persuade African Americans that they could no longer tolerate racially discriminatory laws.   After exchanging phone calls, a group of African American women, the Women's Political Council, decided to call for a boycott of the city buses as a response to this outrage. This suggestion was greeted with enthusiasm by local African American leaders, including the influential black clergy.   On December 5, members of the African American community rallied at the Holt Street Baptist Church in Montgomery and decided to carry out the boycott. Their resolve was inspired by the words of the Reverend  martin luther king jr.   ""We are here this evening,"" King declared to the packed church, ""to say to those who have mistreated us so long that we are tired—tired of being segregated and humiliated; tired of being kicked about by the brutal feet of oppression."" He went on to make a case for peace and nonviolence. Contrasting the methods of nonviolence that he envisioned for a civil rights movement, to the methods of violence used by the racist and terrorist  Ku Klux Klan , King declared,     in our protest there will be no cross burnings…. We will be guided by the highest principles of law and order. Our method will be that of persuasion, not coercion. We will only say to the people, ""Let conscience be your guide"" … [O]ur actions must be guided by the deepest principles of our Christian faith. Love must be our regulating ideal. Once again we must hear the words of Jesus echoing across the centuries: ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you.""     With these words and these events, the long, difficult struggle of the  Civil Rights  movement began.   Another catalyzing event occurred on December 1, 1955, when  rosa parks , an African American woman, was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus. The law required African Americans to sit in the back of city buses and to give up their seats to whites should the white section of the bus become full. The city's black residents, long tired of the indignities of  Segregation , began a boycott of city buses. They recruited King, a 27-year-old preacher, to head the Montgomery Improvement Association, the group which organized the boycott. The African Americans of Montgomery held out for nearly a year despite violence—including the bombing of King's home—directed at them by angry whites. This violence was repugnant to many whites and actually increased support for the civil rights movement among them. The boycott finally achieved its goal on November 13, 1956, when the Supreme Court, in  Gayle v.   Million Man March   On Monday, October 16, 1995, hundreds of thousands of African American men gathered on the Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Million Man March, a daylong rally promoting personal responsibility and racial solidarity. Organized by Louis Farrakhan, leader of the  Nation of Islam , the march was one of the most well attended and significant rallies in the history of the nation's capital. With its mass of men stretching from the Capitol steps to the Washington Monument, the gathering marked a renewed commitment to self-empowerment and betterment on the part of African Americans.   The Million Man March deliberately recalled the 1963 March on Washington, which many consider the high point of the civil rights movement. During that earlier gathering, the Reverend  martin luther king jr. , gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Many speakers at the Million Man March invoked King's speech, noting with a combination of sorrow, anger, and penitence that King's dreams for a racially united America had not yet been realized.   Farrakhan gave the keynote address of the day. Flanked by members of his paramilitary group, the Fruit of Islam, and speaking from behind a bullet-proof shield, he announced at the beginning of his speech, ""We are gathered here to collect ourselves for a responsibility that God is placing on our shoulders to move this nation toward a more perfect union."" He continued to orate for over two hours, frequently bringing home the point that African Americans still suffer disadvantages that European Americans did not have. ""There's still two Americas,"" he declared, ""one black, one white, separate and unequal.""   In another significant speech, the Reverend  jesse jackson  expanded on the religiously inspired tone of repentance that was so much a part of the Million Man March. Speaking for those in attendance, the  Civil Rights  leader prayed for ""God to forgive us for our sins and the foolishness of our ways."" Like many of the other speakers, he called on African American men to take responsibility for their families, to end violence and drug use in the home and in their communities, and to make sure their children are learning in school. He had this to say about the current problems facing African Americans:     We come here today because there is a structural malfunction in America. It was structured in the Constitution, and they referred to us as three-fifths of a human being, legally…. Why do we march? Because our babies die earlier…. Why do we march? Because we're less able to get a primary or secondary education. Why do we march? Because the media stereotypes us. We are projected as less intelligent than we are; less hard-working than we work; less universal than we are; less patriotic than we are; and more violent than we are. Why do we march? We're less able to borrow money…. Why do we march? Because we're trapped with second-class schools and first-class jails.     Other speakers at the march included the Reverend Joseph Lowery; Damu Smith, of Greenpeace; poet Maya Angelou; and  rosa parks , whose arrest inspired the 1955  Montgomery Bus Boycott .   Away from the speakers' podium, the men collected on the Mall made their own history on that day. Coming from different classes, regions, and religions, they were a diverse group not beholden to any one leader. Many men remarked on the deep meaning the experience had for them, on the fellowship and friendships they gained, and on their own commitment to renewal and repair of both themselves and their communities.   One of the most contentious issues of all regarding the march was the attendance figure. The National Park Service officially estimated attendance at 400,000, whereas event organizers pegged it at over 1.5 million. In comparison, the 1963 March on Washington attracted 250,000 participants.   The Million Man March drew an extremely large share of the nation's television audience, as well as laudatory comments from many national leaders, including President  bill clinton  and former general Colin L. Powell.   Browder , 352 U.S. 903, 77 S. Ct. 145, declared Montgomery's bus segregation law unconstitutional. By December 1956, the city was forced to desegregate its buses.   Although African Americans had sporadically demonstrated against segregation laws in previous decades, the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  became a turning point for their protests. It gained significant media attention for the civil rights cause, and it brought King to the fore as a leader. King would go on to head the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference  (SCLC), which was formed in 1957, and to guide the civil rights movement itself. The boycott also marked the end of reliance on litigation as the major tactic for gaining civil rights for African Americans. From this point on the movement also engaged in nonviolent direct action, a technique of civil disobedience that had been used before by pacifists, by labor movements, and by Mohandas K. Gandhi in the struggle to secure India's freedom from Great Britain.   Nonviolent methods had been used by African Americans since the 1940s, when the  congress of racial equality  (CORE)—a group of blacks and whites that formed in 1942 to lobby for equal civil rights for all—organized nonviolent direct action to protest racial discrimination. King described his own view of nonviolent protest in his 1958 book  Stride toward Freedom.  This type of protest worked in part by seeking to create a sense of shame in the opponent.   The nonviolence of the civil rights movement and the power of the federal government over the states were tested as African Americans sought to make use of the rights that had been confirmed by the Supreme Court. For example, segregationist whites, including the Alabama legislature, refused to recognize the rulings of the federal judiciary regarding  School Desegregation . Some whites formed citizens' councils to combat desegregation, and the  Ku Klux Klan  and other reactionary whites began a campaign of  Terrorism , including bombings and murders, intended to intimidate African Americans into giving up their cause.   A significant state-federal confrontation occurred in 1957 at Little Rock, Arkansas's Central High School, when angry mobs of whites attacked nine black students attempting to enroll for classes. President  dwight d. eisenhower  had to send in troops to enforce the Supreme Court's decision in  Brown , confirming   the right of the students to attend the school. In 1962, when  james meredith  attempted to enroll at the University of Mississippi, President  john f. kennedy  also sent in federal military troops to uphold desegregation.   The SCLC, which under King's leadership had become one of the most important civil rights organizations in the country, in turn spawned another influential group, the  Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC, popularly called Snick). In 1960 this group, which was made up of both blacks and whites, became a major player in the civil rights struggle. SNCC attracted youths who were often dissatisfied by what they saw as the unnecessarily moderate goals and methods of the NAACP and the SCLC. SNCC members later led voting registration and education efforts throughout the South, often at great personal risk. Eventually, the group planted the seed of factionalism in the civil rights movement, as it became increasingly radical and alienated from the mainstream of the movement as represented by King.   SNCC played an influential role in another form of nonviolent direct action employed in the civil rights movement: sit-ins. These demonstrations often focused upon the whites-only lunch counters across the South. Armed only with a strict code of conduct that forbade them to strike back or curse their opponents, demonstrators endured jeers, spitting, and blows by angry whites. One tactic associated with this strategy was the jail-in—also called jail, no bail—in which hundreds of people, many of them underage youths, arrived in waves at segregated lunch counters, were arrested for trespassing, and proceeded to overcrowd local jails. Jail-ins bogged down local governments and drew national attention to the cause. In the North, activists responded by picketing businesses, including the Woolworth chain of stores that operated segregated lunch counters in the South. The right to participate in sit-ins was upheld by the Supreme Court decisions  Garner v. Louisiana , 368 U.S. 157, 82 S. Ct. 248, 7 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1961), and  Peterson v. City of Greenville , 373 U.S. 244, 83 S. Ct. 1119, 10 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1963).   The Freedom Rides were a type of nonviolent direct action designed to oppose segregation in interstate buses and bus stations. They were inspired in part by the 1960 Supreme Court decision  Boynton v. Virginia , 364 U.S. 459, 81 S. Ct. 182, 5 L. Ed. 2d 206, which outlawed racial segregation in bus terminals and other places of public accommodation related to interstate transportation. Organized by CORE in 1961, the Freedom Rides were undertaken by six whites and seven blacks who rode two interstate buses from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans. Along the way, the riders deliberately violated segregation policies on the buses and in bus terminal rest rooms, waiting areas, and restaurants. White mobs savagely beat Freedom Riders of both races at different stops in the Deep South and in Alabama, one of the buses was firebombed.   Although the 1961 Freedom Rides proceeded no farther than Jackson, Mississippi, they achieved their larger goal of inducing the federal government to enforce its laws. The administration of President Kennedy sent in  u.s. marshals  to protect the riders during the last part of their journey. An even clearer victory was achieved in September 1961 when the  Interstate Commerce Commission  abolished all segregated facilities in interstate transportation.   On August 28, 1963, the civil rights movement reached a high point of public visibility when it held the March on Washington. Hundreds of thousands of people—an estimated 20 to 30 percent of them white—gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., to urge Congress and the federal government to support desegregation and  voting rights . During this occasion, King gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.   The following summer, civil rights activists in Mississippi organized another highly publicized event, Freedom Summer, a campaign to bring one thousand students, both white and black, into the South to teach and organize voter registration. Many civil rights groups provided backing for this movement, including SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP.   Throughout this period of nonviolent protest, the civil rights movement continued to suffer the effects of white violence.  medgar evers , an NAACP leader who was organizing a black boycott in Jackson, was shot and killed outside his home in 1963. Three participants in Freedom Summer—James Chaney, an African American, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, both whites—were killed in Mississippi in June 1964. Events such as these murders outraged many in the nation and solidified popular support for the civil rights cause.   Then Congress passed one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation ever proposed, the  Civil Rights Act of 1964  (42 U.S.C.A. § 2000a et seq.). This act made Congress an equal partner with the Supreme Court in establishing civil rights. Title II of the act outlawed discrimination in all places of public accommodation, including restaurants and lunch counters, motels and hotels, gas stations, theaters, and sports arenas. It also allowed the  department of justice  to bring suit in order to achieve desegregation in public schools, relieving the NAACP of some of its civil rights litigation caseload. The following year, Congress   passed another important piece of legislation, the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  (42 U.S.C.A. § 1973 et seq.). This act outlawed the voting qualifications, including literacy tests, that whites had used to keep African Americans from voting. It also gave the federal government oversight powers regarding changes in state voting laws. These laws together with federal actions showed that the civil rights movement had the backing of the powers of the federal government and that no amount of resistance, however violent, by white southerners would impede the cause.   By the mid-1960s, the nature of the civil rights movement began to change. African Americans, who had been united in their support of activities such as the Montgomery bus boycott, began to diverge in their views over what political action should be taken to improve their situation. Members of different groups within the movement increasingly expressed their dissatisfaction with other groups. More radical groups, including the Black Muslims and black power proponents, voiced discontent with the limited goals of the civil rights movement and its advocacy of nonviolence.   Many of the new African American radicals called for black separatism or nationalism—that is, separation from white society rather than  Integration  with it. Not content merely to seek civil equality, they began to press for social and economic equality. They also questioned the usefulness of nonviolence and no longer sought to include whites in the movement. SNCC, for example, became an all-black organization in 1966. The arguments of the African American radicals were punctuated by urban riots such as those in the Watts section of Los Angeles in 1965.   By the late 1960s, African Americans still suffered from many disadvantages, including poverty rates that were much higher than those among whites and physical health that was much worse. Racially motivated violence persisted as well, as seen in the assassination of King by a white man in 1968.   Despite these problems, the civil rights movement had forever changed the face of U.S. law and politics. It had led to legislation that gave greater protection to the rights of minorities. It had also greatly changed the role of the judiciary in U.S. government, as the Supreme Court had become more active in its defense of individual rights, often in response to litigation and demonstrations initiated by those in the movement. In this respect, the Court and the civil rights movement had great influence on each other, with each reacting to and encouraging the efforts of the other. Likewise, the federal government had, even if hesitatingly, enforced the rights of a persecuted minority in the face of vigorous opposition from the southern states.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

SCLC was closely associated with its first president, Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.  The SCLC had a large role in the American  Civil Rights Movement .

The origins of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference lie in the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  that began after  Rosa Parks  was arrested for refusing to give her bus seat to a white man. The bus boycott, which lasted from  December 5 ,  1955 , to  December 20 ,  1956 , brought together two  Montgomery  ministers:  Ralph David Abernathy  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. , as well as other Montgomery civil rights activists, and supporters from across the  South .   As campaigns to  desegregate  buses began to spread in the South, a group of 60 activists met in Ebenezer Church in  Atlanta ,  Georgia , in January 1957 to discuss the use of  nonviolent resistance  as the guiding principle for such movements. In addition to King and Abernathy, the conference attracted such civil rights activists as  Ella Baker ,  T. J. Jemison ,  Stanley Levison ,  Joseph Lowery ,  Bayard Rustin ,  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  C. K. Steele , and others.   At the meeting, the group established the Negro Leadership Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration, which was soon renamed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. As its name suggested, the organization intended to draw its strength from leaders of the  Black Church  in the South.   Originally, SCLC was composed of affiliated churches and some community organizations such as the  Montgomery Improvement Association  and Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, rather than individual members. In recent years SCLC has begun recruiting individual and corporate memberships. In the 1950s, SCLC's organizational role was initially seen as a central clearinghouse for information and marshalling support local civil rights struggles by SCLC affiliates. By the early 1960s, SCLC began to offer direct organizational support to affiliates and conduct major campaigns in cooperation with affiliates. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Major campaigns and projects of the 1960s   During its first few years, SCLC activities were focused primarily on education, voter registration, and support for local struggles being waged by SCLC affiliates. SCLC and Dr. King were sometimes criticized for lack of militancy by younger activists in groups such as  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) and the  Congress of Racial Equality  (CORE) who were participating in  sit-ins  and  Freedom Rides .     [ edit ]   Citizenship Schools   Originally started in  1954  by Esau Jenkins and  Septima Clark  on the  Sea Islands  off the coast of  South Carolina  and  Georgia , the Citizenship Schools focused on teaching adults to read so they could pass the voter-registration  literacy tests , fill out driver's license exams, use mail-order forms, and open checking accounts. Under the auspices of the Highlander Folk School (now  Highlander Research and Education Center ) the program was expanded across the South.   When the state of  Tennessee  revoked Highlander's charter and confiscated its land and property in 1961, SCLC rescued the citizenship school program and added Septima Clark, Bernice Robinson, and  Andrew Young  to its staff. Under the innocuous cover of adult-literacy classes, the schools secretly taught democracy and civil rights, community leadership and organizing, practical politicals, and the strategies and tactics of resistance and struggle, and in so doing built the human foundations of the mass community struggles to come.   Eventually, close to 10,000 teachers, most of them unpaid volunteers and many with little formal education, taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. [ 3 ]  Many of the  Civil Rights Movement 's adult leaders such as  Fannie Lou Hamer  and  Victoria Gray , and hundreds of other local leaders in black communities across the South attended and taught citizenship schools. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement       Main article:  Albany Movement       In 1961 and 1962, SCLC joined SNCC in the  Albany Movement , a broad protest against segregation in  Albany , Georgia. It is generally considered the organization's first major nonviolent campaign. At the time, it was considered by many to be unsuccessful: despite large demonstrations and many arrests, few changes were won, and the protests drew little national attention. Yet, despite the lack of immediate gains, much of the success of the subsequent Birmingham Campaign can be attributed to lessons learned in Albany. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       By contrast, the 1963 SCLC  campaign  in  Birmingham , Alabama, was an unqualified success. The campaign focused on a single goal  the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants  rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The brutal response of local police, led by Public Safety Commissioner  ""Bull"" Connor , stood in stark contrast to the nonviolent civil disobedience of the activists.   After his arrest in April, King wrote the "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" in response to a group of clergy who had criticized the Birmingham campaign, writing that it was ""directed and led in part by outsiders"" and that the demonstrations were ""unwise and untimely."" [ 6 ]  In his letter, King explained that, as president of SCLC, he had been asked to come to Birmingham by the local members:     I think I should indicate why I am here In Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against ""outsiders coming in."" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. ... Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here I am here because I have organizational ties here. [ 7 ]     King also addressed the question of ""timeliness"":     One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. ... Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""Wait!"" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never."" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied."" We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. [ 7 ]     The most dramatic moments of the Birmingham campaign came on  2 May , when more than 1,000 Black children left school to join the demonstrations; hundreds were arrested. The following day, 2,500 more students joined and were met by Bull Connor with police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. That evening, television news programs reported to the nation and the world scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators. Public outrage led the  Kennedy  administration to intervene more forcefully and a settlement was announced on  10 May , under which the downtown businesses would desegregate and eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, and the city would release the jailed protesters.     [ edit ]   March on Washington       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       After the Birmingham Campaign, SCLC called for massive protests in  Washington DC  to push for new civil rights legislation that would outlaw segregation nation-wide.  A. Philip Randolph  and  Bayard Rustin  issued similar calls for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. On July 2, 1963, King, Randolph, and Rustin met with  James L. Farmer, Jr.  of  CORE ,  John Lewis  of  SNCC ,  Roy Wilkins  of the  NAACP , and  Whitney Young  of the  Urban League  to plan a united march on August 28.   The media and political establishment viewed the march with great fear and trepidation over the possibility that protesters would run riot in the streets of the capitol. But their fears, the March on Washington was a huge success, with no violence, and an estimated number of participants ranging from 200,000 to 300,000. It was also a logistical triumph  more than 2,000 buses, 21 special trains, 10 chartered aircraft, and uncounted autos converged on the city in the morning and departed without difficulty by nightfall.   The crowning moment of the march was Dr. King's famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech in which he articulated the hopes and aspirations of the  Civil Rights Movement  and rooted it in two cherished gospels  the Old Testament and the unfulfilled promise of the American creed. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   St. Augustine Protests   When civil rights activists protesting segregation in St. Augustine, Florida were met with arrests and Ku Klux Klan violence, the local SCLC affiliate appealed to Dr. King for assistance in the spring of 1964. SCLC sent staff to help organize and lead demonstrations and mobilized support for St. Augustine in the North. Hundreds were arrested on sit-ins and marches opposing segregation, so many that the jails were filled and the overflow prisoners had to be held in outdoor stockades. Among the northern supporters who endured arrest and incarceration were Mrs. Malcolm Peabody, the mother of the governor of Massachusetts and Mrs. John Burgess, wife of the Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts. [ 9 ]   Nightly marches to the Old Slave Market were attacked by white mobs, and when blacks attempted to integrate ""white-only"" beaches they were assaulted by police who beat them with clubs. On June 11, Dr. King and other SCLC leaders were arrested for trying to lunch at the Monson Motel restaurant, and when an integrated group of young protesters tried to use the motel swimming pool the owner poured acid into the water. TV and newspaper stories of the struggle for justice in St. Augustine helped build public support for the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 10 ]  that was then being debated in  Congress . [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Selma Voting Rights Campaign and March to Montgomery       Main article:  Selma to Montgomery marches       When voter registration and civil rights activity in  Selma, Alabama  was blocked by an illegal injunction, [ 12 ]  the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) asked SCLC for assistance. Dr. King, SCLC, and DCVL chose Selma as the site for a major campaign around voting rights that would demand national voting rights legislation in the same way that the  Birmingham  and St. Augustine campaigns won passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 . [ 10 ] [ 13 ]   In cooperation with SNCC who had been organizing in Selma since early 1963, the Voting Rights Campaign commenced with a rally in  Brown Chapel  on  January 2 , 1965 in defiance of the injunction. SCLC and SNCC organizers recruited and trained blacks to attempt to register to vote at the courthouse, where many of them were abused and arrested by  Dallas County  Sheriff Jim Clark  a staunch segregationist. Black voter applicants were subjected to economic retaliation by the  White Citizens' Council , and threatened with physical violence by the  Ku Klux Klan . Officials used the discriminatory  literacy test [ 14 ]  to keep blacks off the voter rolls.   Nonviolent mass marches demanded the right to vote and the jails filled up with arrested protesters, many of them students. On February 1, Dr. King and Rev. Abernathy were arrested. Voter registration efforts and protest marches spread to the surrounding  Black Belt  counties   Perry ,  Wilcox ,  Marengo ,  Greene , and  Hale .   On February 18, an Alabama State Trooper shot and killed  Jimmie Lee Jackson  during a voting rights protest in  Marion , county seat of Perry County. In response, on March 7 close to 600 protesters attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery to present their grievances to Governor  Wallace . Led by Reverend  Hosea Williams  of SCLC and  John Lewis  of SNCC, the marchers were attacked by State Troopers, deputy sheriffs, and mounted possemen who used tear-gas, clubs, and bull whips to drive them back to Brown Chapel. News coverage of this brutal assault on nonviolent demonstrators protesting for the right to vote  which became known as ""Bloody Sunday""  horrified the nation. [ 15 ]   Dr. King called on clergy and people of conscience to support the black citizens of Selma. Thousands of religious leaders and ordinary Americans came to demand voting rights for all. One of them was  James Reeb , a white  Unitarian Universalist  minister, who was savagely beaten to death on the street by Klansmen who severely injured two other ministers in the same attack.   After many more protests, arrests, and much legal maneuvering, a Federal judge ordered Alabama to allow the march to Montgomery. It began on March 21 and arrived in Montgomery on the 24th. On the 25th, an estimated 25,000 [ 16 ]  protesters marched to the steps of the Alabama capitol in support of voting rights where Dr. King spoke [ 17 ]  on the voting rights struggle. Within five months, Congress and President  Lyndon Johnson  responded to the enormous public pressure generated by the Voting Rights Campaign by enacting into law the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 .     [ edit ]   Grenada Freedom Movement   When the  Meredith Mississippi March Against Fear  passed through  Grenada   Mississippi  on June 15, 1966, it sparked months of civil rights activity on the part of Grenada blacks. They formed the Grenada County Freedom Movement (GCFM) as an SCLC affiliate, and within days 1,300 blacks registered to vote. [ 18 ]   Though the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 10 ]  had outlawed segregation of public facilities, the law had not been applied in Grenada which still maintained rigid segregation. After black students were arrested for trying to sit downstairs in the ""white"" section of the movie theater, SCLC and the GCFM demanded that all forms of segregation be eliminated, and called for a boycott of white merchants. Over the summer, the number of protests increased and many demonstrators and SCLC organizers were arrested as police enforced the old  Jim Crow  social order. In July and August, large mobs of white segregationists mobilized by the  KKK  violently attacked nonviolent marchers and news reporters with rocks, bottles, baseball bats and steel pipes.   When the new school year began in September, SCLC and the GCFM encouraged more than 450 black students to register at the formerly white schools under a court desegregation order. This was by far the largest school integration attempt in Mississippi since the  Brown v. Board of Education  ruling in 1954. The all-white school board resisted fiercely, whites threatened black parents with economic retaliation if they did not withdraw their children, and by the first day of school the number of black children registered in the white schools had dropped to approximately 250. On the first day of class, September 12, a furious white mob organized by the Klan attacked the black children and their parents with clubs, chains, whips, and pipes as they walked to school, injuring many and hospitalizing several with broken bones. Police and Mississippi State Troopers made no effort to halt or deter the mob violence.   Over the following days, white mobs continued to attack the black children until public pressure and a Federal court order finally forced Mississippi lawmen to intervene. By the end of the first week, many black parents had withdrawn their children from the white schools out of fear for their safety, but approximately 150 black students continued to attend, still the largest school integration in state history up to that point in time.   Inside the schools, blacks were harassed by white teachers, threatened and attacked by white students, and many blacks were expelled on flimsy pretexts by school officials. By mid-October, the number of blacks attending the white schools had dropped to roughly 70. When school officials refused to meet with a delegation of black parents, black students began boycotting both the white and black schools in protest. Many children, parents, GCFM activists, and SCLC organizers were arrested for protesting the school situation. By the end of October, almost all of the 2600 black students in Grenada County were boycotting school. The boycott was not ended until early November when SCLC attorneys won a Federal court order that the school system treat everyone equal regardless of race and meet with black parents.     [ edit ]   Chicago Freedom Movement       Main article:  Chicago Freedom Movement         [ edit ]   Poor People's Campaign       Main article:  Poor People's Campaign         [ edit ]   Relationships with other organizations   Because of its dedication to  non-violent  direct-action protests,  Civil disobedience , and mobilizing mass participation in boycotts and marches, SCLC was considered more ""radical"" than the older  NAACP  which favored lawsuits, legislative lobbying, and education campaigns conducted by professionals and usually opposed civil-disobedience. At the same time it was generally considered to be less radical than  CORE  or the youth-led  SNCC .   To a certain extent during the period 1960-1964, SCLC had a mentoring relationship with SNCC before SNCC began moving away from nonviolence and integration in the late 1960s. Over time, SCLC and SNCC took different strategic paths, with SCLC focusing on large-scale campaigns such as  Birmingham  and  Selma  to win national legislation and SNCC focusing on community-organizing to build political power on the local level. In many communities, there was tension between SCLC and SNCC because SCLC's base was the minister-led Black churches and SNCC was trying to build rival community organizations led by the poor. [ 19 ]   In August 1979, head of the SCLC, Joseph Lowery, met with the  Palestinian Liberation Organization  and endorsed  Palestinian  self-determination and urged the PLO to ""consider"" recognizing  Israel 's right to exist. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Leadership   The best-known member of the SCLC was  Martin Luther King , who led the organization until he was assassinated on April 4 1968. Other prominent members of the organization have included  Joseph Lowery ,  Ralph Abernathy ,  Ella Baker ,  James Bevel ,  Diane Nash , Jesse Jackson ,  James Orange ,  Charles Kenzie Steele ,  C.T. Vivian ,  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Walter E. Fauntroy ,  Claude Young ,  Septima Clark , Dorothy Cotton,  Curtis W. Harris ,  Hosea Williams ,  Maya Angelou , and  Andrew Young .

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey ,   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. This period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ,"" and while it was most intense in the South to a lesser degree it affected the entire nation.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South and spread nation-wide became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system, and it remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states at the turn of the century and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, they were not able to elect one person in the South to represent their interests. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate and unequal ""white"" and ""colored"" domains.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and the number of African-Americans elected to office decreased. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and, in many cases, poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909 and it struggled to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west in the millions, a huge population movement collectively known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by its lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation  in the face of "" massive resistance "" by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, they adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 2 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 4 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 5 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 6 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 7 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 8 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 9 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 10 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 11 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 12 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 13 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. The campaign focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. It was also helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 16 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous  Letter from Birmingham Jail [ 17 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement by jail authorities. [ 18 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King eventually was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in the negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he had accumulated a great deal of scepticism about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. The reaction from parts of the white community was even more violent. The  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, was bombed, as was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King. Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 19 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 20 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 23 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 24 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 25 ]   Three civil rights workers,  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964 (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 26 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of all the forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 27 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 29 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 24 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .     [ edit ]   Dr. King Awarded Nobel Peace Prize   On December 10, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , the youngest man to receive the award; he was 35 years of age. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 31 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 32 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 33 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 35 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     After  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While the  Ku Klux Klan  was not as prevalent as it was in the South, other problems prevailed in northern cities. Urban black neighborhoods were among the poorest in most major cities. Unemployment was much higher than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived and mostly worked menial or blue-collar jobs for a fraction of the pay that white co-workers received. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had very few white students. Worst of all, black neighborhoods were subject to police problems that white neighborhoods were not at all accustomed to dealing with.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 36 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 37 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers who would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 38 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot a 15-year-old black named James Powell for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 39 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 40 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 41 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 42 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 43 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 44 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 46 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local autrities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstreamChurches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buseshe success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Freuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the Nid. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with two-hundred-fifty other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local autrities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstreamChurches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buseshe success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Freuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the Nid. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with two-hundred-fifty other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

The  American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring suffrage in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly suppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disnfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more complicated. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass  racial violence against blacks (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events       Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement         [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954       Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education       On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956       Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott       On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local because they have big source and love the site so they had to desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957       Main article:  Little Rock Nine              Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960       Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins       The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961       Main article:  Freedom Rider       Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the rolls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962       Main article:  Albany Movement       The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964       Main article:  Birmingham campaign       The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest. SCLC organizers came up with a bold and controversial alternative, calling on high school students to take part in the demonstrations. More than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963       Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom              The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964       Main article:  Freedom Summer       In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964       Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party       Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965       Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act       SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February.   On March 7, 1965,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968       Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination       Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970     See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States     By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966       Main article:  Black Power              A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War     See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans     There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

Du Bois ; top right:  Malcolm X ; bottom left:  Martin Luther King, Jr. ; bottom right:  Rosa Parks .       The  African-American Civil Rights Movement  (19551968) refers to the reform movements in the United States aimed at abolishing  racial discrimination  against  African Americans  and restoring  Suffrage  in Southern states. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the  South . By 1966, the emergence of the  Black Power Movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity,  economic  and  political   self-sufficiency , and freedom from oppression by  whites .   Many of those who were most active in the Civil Rights Movement, with organizations such as  SNCC ,  CORE  and  SCLC , prefer the term ""Southern Freedom Movement"" because the struggle was about far more than just civil rights under law; it was also about fundamental issues of freedom, respect, dignity, and economic and social equality.

(April 2008)       After the  disputed election  of 1876 and the end of  Reconstruction , White Americans in the South resumed political control of the region under a one-party system of Democratic control. The voting rights of blacks were increasingly oppressed, racial segregation imposed, and violence against African Americans mushroomed. Through the early 1900s, this period is often referred to as the "" nadir of American race relations ."" While problems and civil rights violations were most intense in the South, social tensions affected African Americans in other regions as well.   The system of overt, state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged out of the post-Reconstruction South became known as the "" Jim Crow "" system. It remained virtually intact into the early 1950s. Systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in Southern states from 1890-1908 and lasted until national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. For more than 60 years, for example, they were not able to elect a single person in the South to represent their interests in Congress. [ 1 ]  Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries limited to voters. They had no part in the justice system or law enforcement, although in the 1880s, they still had held many local offices, including that of sheriff.   Characteristics:     Racial segregation . By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate ""white"" and ""colored"" domains. Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.   Disenfranchisement . When White American Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more inaccessible to blacks. Black voters were forced off the voting rolls, and elections were made more complicated. The number of African Americans voters dropped dramatically, and they no longer were able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised most African Americans and tens of thousands of poor White Americans.   Exploitation . Increased economic oppression of blacks, Latinos, and Asians, denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.   Violence . Individual, police, organizational, and  mass racial violence against blacks  (and Latinos in the Southwest and Asians in California).     African-Americans and other racial minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing ( see  the  American Civil Rights Movement 1896-1954 ). The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through  litigation , education, and  lobbying  efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954) that rejected separate white and colored school systems and by implication overturned the "" separate but equal "" doctrine established in  Plessy v. Ferguson .   Since the situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs), from 1910-1970, African Americans sought better lives by migrating north and west. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the  Great Migration .   Invigorated by the victory of  Brown  and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about  desegregation . They were faced with "" massive resistance "" in the South by proponents of racial segregation and  voter suppression . In defiance, African Americans adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience , giving rise to the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1955-1968.   During the period 1955-1968, acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between protesters and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to respond immediately to crisis situations which highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of civil disobedience included  boycotts , beginning with the successful  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama; "" sit-ins "" such as the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina; and  marches , such as the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations; the  Voting Rights Act of 1965 , that restored and protected voting rights; the  Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 , that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the  Civil Rights Act of 1968 , that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. African Americans re-entered politics in the South, and across the country young people were inspired to action.     [ edit ]   Mass action replacing litigation   The strategy of mass action within the court system shifted after  Brown  to ""direct action""primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins,  freedom rides , and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobediencefrom 1955 to 1965. In part this was the unintended result of the local authorities' attempt to outlaw and harass the mainstream.   Churches, the centers of their communities, and local grassroots organizations mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges.   The  Montgomery Improvement Association created to lead the boycottmanaged to keep the boycott going for over a year until a federal court order required Montgomery to desegregate its buses. The success in Montgomery made its leader Dr. Martin Luther King a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the highly successful  Tallahassee, Florida , boycott of 1956-1957. [ 3 ]   In 1957 Dr. King and Rev.  John Duffy , the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as Rev. C. K. Steele of Tallahassee and Rev.  T. J. Jemison  of Baton Rouge; and other activists such as Rev.  Fred Shuttlesworth ,  Ella Baker ,  A. Philip Randolph ,  Bayard Rustin  and  Stanley Levison , to form the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The SCLC, with its headquarters in  Atlanta, Georgia , did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from Northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made non-violence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.   In 1959,  Septima Clarke ,  Bernice Robinson , and  Esau Jenkins , with the help of the  Highlander Folk School  in Tennessee, began the first  Citizenship Schools  in  South Carolina 's  Sea Islands . They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on  St. John Island . SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.     [ edit ]   Mainstream exposure   Some of the success of the Civil Rights Movement can be attributed to  television  coverage. The taping and broadcasting of the images of civil rights workers, sit-ins, marches and clashes demonstrated as never before the severe and inhumane treatment of African Americans by authorities in the South. Such coverage wakened the conscience of mainstream or middle America as to conditions in the South. In  ""Television News and the Civil Rights Struggle""  Prof. William Thomas argues that even ""in the American South, local television news coverage had immediate and significant effects"" on perceptions of social equality and segregation. [2]   One of Martin Luther King's strategies was to challenge mainstream America on moral grounds to end the racial abuse and segregation in the South. The medium of television was particularly effective at conveying the news about the conditions of the quality of life for African Americans in the South. The news broadcasts and documentary film making were the first forms for presenting these stories. Later in the 1970s, the film ""Roots"" by Alex Haley was said to be a turning point in mainstream America's ability to relate to the stresses and particularities of African American history.     [ edit ]   Key events   Main article:  Timeline of the African-American Civil Rights Movement     [ edit ]   Brown v. Board of Education , 1954   Main article:  Brown v. Board of Education   On May 17, 1954, the  United States Supreme Court  handed down its decision regarding the case called  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas , in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court stated that the ""segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group."" The Court ruled that both  Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the segregationist, ""separate but equal"" standard in general, and  Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education  (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional. The following year, in the case known as  Brown v. Board of Education , the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, ""with all deliberate speed"". [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 19551956   Main articles:  Rosa Parks  and  Montgomery Bus Boycott   On December 1, 1955,  Rosa Parks  (the ""mother of the Civil Rights Movement"") refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. She was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the  Highlander Center  in Tennessee where nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy had been discussed. Parks was arrested, tried, and convicted for disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. After word of this incident reached the black community, 50 African-American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott to demand a more humane bus transportation system. However, after any reforms were rejected the NAACP, led by E.D. Nixon, pushed for full desegregation of public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days until the local ordinance segregating African-Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery took part in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue by 80%. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956, and the boycott ended in triumph. (W. Chafe,  The Unfinished Journey )   A young Baptist minister named  Martin Luther King, Jr. , was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.     [ edit ]   Desegregating Little Rock, 1957   Main article:  Little Rock Nine          Troops from the  327th Regiment, 101st Airborne  escorting the Little Rock Nine up the steps of Central High       Little Rock, Arkansas , was in a relatively progressive Southern state. A crisis erupted, however, when  Governor of Arkansas   Orval Faubus  called out the  National Guard  on September 4 to prevent entry to the  nine African-American students  who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school,  Little Rock Central High School . [ 5 ]  The nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades. On the first day of school, only one of the nine students showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. She was harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car to protect her. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in  jeeps .   Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the  Brown  decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court order that required it.   Faubus' order received the attention of President  Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. Eisenhower federalized the  National Guard  and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower then deployed elements of the  101st Airborne Division  to Little Rock to protect the students.   The students were able to attend high school. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from fellow students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were still teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers weren't around. One of the Little Rock Nine,  Minnijean Brown , was expelled for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line.   Only one of the Little Rock Nine,  Ernest Green , got the chance to graduate; after the 1957-58 school year was over, the Little Rock school system decided to shut public schools completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.     [ edit ]   Sit-ins, 1960   Main article:  Greensboro sit-ins   The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy with a student sit-in at a  Woolworth 's store in  Greensboro, North Carolina . [ 6 ]  On February 1, 1960, four students  Ezell A. Blair Jr.  (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Joseph McNeil, and Franklin McCain from  North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College , an all-black college, sat down at the segregated lunch counter to protest Woolworth's policy of excluding African Americans. [ 7 ]  These protesters were encouraged to dress professionally, to sit quietly, and to occupy every other stool so that potential white sympathizers could join in. The sit-in soon inspired other sit-ins in  Richmond, Virginia ;  Nashville, Tennessee ; and  Atlanta, Georgia . As students across the south began to ""sit-in"" at the lunch counters of a few of their local stores, local authority figures sometimes used brute force to physically escort the demonstrators from the lunch facilities.   The ""sit-in"" technique was not new as far back as 1942, the  Congress of Racial Equality  sponsored sit-ins in Chicago, St. Louis in 1949 and Baltimore in 1952. In 1960 the technique succeeded in bringing national attention to the movement. [ 8 ]  The success of the Greensboro sit-in led to a rash of student campaigns throughout the South. Probably the best organized, most highly disciplined, the most immediately effective of these was in Nashville, Tennessee. [ 9 ]  By the end of 1960, the sit-ins had spread to every southern and  border state  and even to  Nevada ,  Illinois , and  Ohio .   Demonstrators focused not only on lunch counters but also on parks, beaches, libraries, theaters, museums, and other public places. Upon being arrested, student demonstrators made ""jail-no-bail"" pledges, to call attention to their cause and to reverse the cost of protest, thereby saddling their jailers with the financial burden of prison space and food.   In 1960 activists who had led these sit-ins formed the  Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  (SNCC) to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Founded  ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans     [ edit ]   Freedom Rides, 1961   Main article:  Freedom Rider   Freedom Rides were journeys by Civil Rights activists on interstate buses into the segregated southern United States to test the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia, (1960) 364 U.S. that ended segregation for passengers engaged in inter-state travel. Organized by  CORE , the first Freedom Ride of the 1960s left Washington D.C. on May 4, 1961, and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17. [ 10 ]   During the first and subsequent Freedom Rides, activists traveled through the  Deep South  to integrate seating patterns and desegregate bus terminals, including restrooms and water fountains. That proved to be a dangerous mission. In  Anniston, Alabama , one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee for their lives. In  Birmingham, Alabama , an  FBI  informant reported that Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor gave  Ku Klux Klan  or KKK members 15 minutes to attack an incoming group of freedom riders before having police ""protect"" them. The riders were severely beaten ""until it looked like a bulldog had got a hold of them.""   Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham temporarily halted the rides until SNCC activists arrived in Birmingham to resume them. In  Montgomery, Alabama  a mob charged another bus load of riders, knocking  John Lewis  unconscious with a crate and smashing  Life  photographer  Don Urbrock  in the face with his own camera. A dozen men surrounded Jim Zwerg, a white student from  Fisk University , and beat him in the face with a suitcase, knocking out his teeth.   The freedom riders continued their rides into  Jackson, Mississippi , where they were arrested for ""breaching the peace"" by using ""white only"" facilities. New freedom rides were organized by many different organizations. As riders arrived in Jackson, they were arrested. By the end of summer, more than 300 had been jailed in Mississippi.   The jailed freedom riders were treated harshly, crammed into tiny, filthy cells and sporadically beaten. In  Jackson, Mississippi , some male prisoners were forced to do hard labor in 100-degree heat. Others were transferred to  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , where their food was deliberately oversalted and their mattresses were removed. Sometimes the men were suspended by ""wrist breakers"" from the walls. Typically, the windows of their cells were shut tight on hot days, making it hard for them to breathe.   Eventually, public sympathy and support for the freedom riders forced the Kennedy administration to order the  Interstate Commerce Commission  (ICC) to issue a new desegregation order. When the new ICC rule took effect on November 1, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they chose on the bus; ""white"" and ""colored"" signs came down in the terminals; separate drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms were consolidated; and lunch counters began serving people regardless of skin color.   The student movement involved such celebrated figures as John Lewis, the single-minded activist who ""kept on"" despite many beatings and harassments;  James Lawson , the revered ""guru"" of nonviolent theory and tactics;  Diane Nash , an articulate and intrepid public champion of justice;  Bob Moses , pioneer of voting registration in Mississippithe most rural and most dangerous part of the South; and  James Bevel , a fiery preacher and charismatic organizer and facilitator. Other prominent student activists included  Charles McDew ;  Bernard Lafayette ;  Charles Jones ;  Lonnie King ;  Julian Bond  (associated with  Atlanta University );  Hosea Williams ; and  Stokely Carmichael  (who later changed his name to Kwame Ture).     [ edit ]   Voter Registration Organizing   After the Freedom Rides, local black leaders in Mississippi such as  Amzie Moore ,  Aaron Henry ,  Medgar Evers , and others asked SNCC to help register black voters and to build community organizations that could win a share of political power in the state. Since Mississippi ratified its constitution in 1890, with provisions such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests, it made registration more complicated and stripped blacks from the polls. After so many years, the intent to stop blacks from voting had become part of the culture of white supremacy. In the fall of 1961, SNCC organizer  Robert Moses  began the first such project in  McComb  and the surrounding counties in the Southwest corner of the state. Their efforts were met with violent repression from state and local lawmen,  White Citizens' Council , and  Ku Klux Klan  resulting in beatings, hundreds of arrests and the murder of voting activist Herbert Lee. [ 11 ]   White opposition to black voter registration was so intense in Mississippi that Freedom Movement activists concluded that all of the state's civil rights organizations had to unite in a coordinated effort to have any chance of success. In February 1962, representatives of SNCC, CORE, and the NAACP formed the  Council of Federated Organizations  (COFO). At a subsequent meeting in August, SCLC became part of COFO. [ 12 ]   In the Spring of 1962, with funds from the  Voter Education Project , SNCC/COFO began voter registration organizing in the Mississippi Delta area around  Greenwood , and the areas surrounding  Hattiesburg ,  Laurel , and  Holly Springs . As in McComb, their efforts were met with fierce opposition  arrests, beatings, shootings, arson, and murder. Registrars used the  literacy test  to keep blacks off the voting roles by creating standards that highly educated people could not meet. In addition, employers fired blacks who tried to register and landlords evicted them from their homes. [ 13 ]  Over the following years, the black voter registration campaign spread across the state.   Similar voter registration campaigns  with similar responses  were begun by SNCC, CORE, and SCLC in  Louisiana ,  Alabama , southwest  Georgia , and  South Carolina . By 1963, voter registration campaigns in the South were as integral to the Freedom Movement as desegregation efforts. After passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ] , protecting and facilitating voter registration despite state barriers became the main effort of the movement. It resulted in passage of the  Voting Rights Act  of 1965.     [ edit ]   Integration of Mississippi Universities, 1956-1965   In 1956,  Clyde Kennard  made his first of three attempts to enter  The University of Southern Mississippi , then known as Mississippi Southern College. His efforts were rebuffed. At the behest of the  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , Kennard was falsely accused and convicted of burglary in 1960. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but he was freed after serving three years, after being diagnosed with colon cancer. [ 14 ]  Following persistent efforts by local civil rights activists, in 1965  Raylawni Young Branch  and  Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong  became the first African-American students to attend the University of Southern Mississippi.          James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals       James Meredith  won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to the  University of Mississippi  in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26, only to be blocked by Mississippi  Governor   Ross R. Barnett , who proclaimed that ""no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.""   After the  Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor  Paul B. Johnson, Jr.  in  contempt , with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll, Meredith, escorted by a force of  U.S. Marshals , entered the campus on September 30, 1962. White students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith at Lyceum Hall, then firing on the marshals. Two people, including a French journalist, were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President Kennedy sent the regular Army to the campus to quell the uprising. Meredith was able to begin classes the following day, after the troops arrived. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Albany Movement, 1961-1962   Main article:  Albany Movement   The SCLC, which had been criticized by some student activists for its failure to participate more fully in the freedom rides, committed much of its prestige and resources to a desegregation campaign in  Albany, Georgia , in November 1961. King, who had been criticized personally by some SNCC activists for his distance from the dangers that local organizers facedand given the derisive nickname ""De Lawd"" as a resultintervened personally to assist the campaign led by both SNCC organizers and local leaders.   The campaign was a failure because of the canny tactics of Laurie Pritchett, the local police chief, and divisions within the black community. The goals may not have been specific enough. Pritchett contained the marchers without violent attacks on demonstrators that inflamed national opinion. He also arranged for arrested demonstrators to be taken to jails in surrounding communities, allowing plenty of room to remain in his jail. Prichett also foresaw King's presence as a danger and forced his release to avoid King's rallying the black community. King left in 1962 without having achieved any dramatic victories. The local movement, however, continued the struggle, and it obtained significant gains in the next few years. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Birmingham campaign, 1963-1964   Main article:  Birmingham campaign   The Albany movement was shown to be an important education for the SCLC, however, when it undertook the Birmingham campaign in 1963. Executive Director  Wyatt Tee Walker  carefully planned strategy and tactics for the campaign. It focused on one goalthe desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants, rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The movement's efforts were helped by the brutal response of local authorities, in particular  Eugene ""Bull"" Connor , the Commissioner of Public Safety. He had long held much political power, but had lost a recent election for mayor to a less rabidly segregationist candidate. Refusing to accept the new mayor's authority, Connor intended to stay in office.   The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins, kneel-ins at local churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a drive to register voters. The city, however, obtained an  injunction  barring all such protests. Convinced that the order was unconstitutional, the campaign defied it and prepared for mass arrests of its supporters. King elected to be among those arrested on April 12, 1963. [ 17 ]   While in jail, King wrote his famous "" Letter from Birmingham Jail "" [ 18 ]  on the margins of a newspaper, since he had not been allowed any writing paper while held in solitary confinement. [ 19 ]  Supporters pressured the Kennedy Administration to intervene to obtain King's release or better conditions. King was allowed to call his wife, who was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child, and was released on April 19.   The campaign, however, was faltering because the movement was running out of demonstrators willing to risk arrest.  James Bevel , SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education, came up with a bold and controversial alternative, to train high school students to take part in the demonstrations. As a result, more than one thousand students skipped school on May 2 to meet at the 16th Street Baptist Church to join the demonstrations, in what would come to be called the  Children's Crusade . More than six hundred ended up in jail. This was newsworthy, but in this first encounter, the police acted with restraint. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When they started marching, Bull Connor unleashed police dogs on them, then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children. Television cameras broadcast to the nation the scenes of water from fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators.   Widespread public outrage forced the Kennedy Administration to intervene more forcefully in negotiations between the white business community and the SCLC. On May 10, the parties announced an agreement to desegregate the lunch counters and other public accommodations downtown, to create a committee to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, to arrange for the release of jailed protesters, and to establish regular means of communication between black and white leaders.          Alabama governor George Wallace stands against desegregation at the  University of Alabama  in 1963.       Not everyone in the black community approved of the agreement the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth was particularly critical, since he was skeptical about the good faith of Birmingham's power structure from his experience in dealing with them. Parts of the white community reacted violently. They bombed the  Gaston  Motel, which housed the SCLC's unofficial headquarters, and the home of King's brother, the Reverend A. D. King.   Kennedy prepared to federalize the  Alabama National Guard  but did not follow through. Four months later, on September 15, a conspiracy of Ku Klux Klan members  bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church  in Birmingham, killing four young girls.   Other events of the summer of 1963:  On June 11, 1963,  George Wallace , Governor of Alabama, tried to block [ 20 ]  the integration of the  University of Alabama . President John F. Kennedy sent enough force to make Governor Wallace step aside, allowing the enrollment of two black students. That evening, JFK addressed the nation on TV and radio with a historic civil rights speech. [ 21 ]  The next day Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The next week as promised, on June 19, 1963, JFK submitted his Civil Rights bill to Congress. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   March on Washington, 1963   Main article:  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom          The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom at the  National Mall              Civil Rights March on Washington, leaders marching from the  Washington Monument  to the  Lincoln Memorial              Civil Rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial       A. Philip Randolph had planned a march on  Washington, D.C. , in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of  employment discrimination  in defense industries; he called off the march when the  Roosevelt  Administration met the demand by issuing  Executive Order 8802  barring racial discrimination and creating an agency to oversee compliance with the order.   Randolph and Bayard Rustin were the chief planners of the second march, which they proposed in 1962. The Kennedy Administration applied great pressure on Randolph and King to call it off but without success. The march was held on August 28, 1963.   Unlike the planned 1941 march, for which Randolph included only black-led organizations in the planning, the 1963 march was a collaborative effort of all of the major civil rights organizations, the more progressive wing of the labor movement, and other liberal organizations. The march had six official goals: ""meaningful civil rights laws, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education."" Of these, the march's real focus was on passage of the civil rights law that the Kennedy Administration had proposed after the upheavals in Birmingham.   National media attention also greatly contributed to the march's national exposure and probable impact. In his section  ""The March on Washington and Television News,""  William Thomas notes: ""Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers"". By carrying the organizers' speeches and offering their own commentary, television stations literally framed the way their local audiences saw and understood the event.  [3]   The march was a success, although not without controversy. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the  Lincoln Memorial , where King delivered his famous "" I Have a Dream "" speech. While many speakers applauded the Kennedy Administration for the efforts it had made toward obtaining new, more effective civil rights legislation protecting the right to vote and outlawing segregation, John Lewis of  SNCC  took the Administration to task for how little it had done to protect southern blacks and civil rights workers under attack in the Deep South.   After the march, King and other civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the  White House . While the Kennedy Administration appeared to be sincerely committed to passing the bill, it was not clear that it had the votes to do it. But when  President Kennedy was assassinated  on November 22, 1963, [ 24 ]  the new President  Lyndon Johnson  decided to use his influence in  Congress  to bring about much of Kennedy's legislative agenda.   ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA, 1963-1964   St. Augustine, on the northeast coast of Florida was famous as the ""Nation's Oldest City,"" founded by the Spanish in 1565. It became the stage for a great drama leading up to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. A local movement, led by Dr. Robert B. Hayling, a black dentist and Air Force veteran, had been picketing segregated local institutions since 1963, as a result of which Dr. Hayling and three companions, James Jackson, Clyde Jenkins, and James Hauser, were brutally beaten at a Ku Klux Klan rally in the fall of that year. Nightriders shot into black homes, and teenagers Audrey Nell Edwards, JoeAnn Anderson, Samuel White, and Willie Carl Singleton (who came to be known as ""The St. Augustine Four"") spent six months in jail and reform school after sitting in at the local Woolworth's lunch counter. It took a special action of the governor and cabinet of Florida to release them after national protests by the Pittsburgh Courier, Jackie Robinson, and others.   In 1964, Dr. Hayling and other activists urged the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to come to St. Augustine. The first action came during spring break, when Hayling appealed to northern college students to come to the Ancient City, not to go to the beach, but to take part in demonstrations. Four prominent Massachusetts women--Mrs. Mary Parkman Peabody, Mrs. Esther Burgess, Mrs. Hester Campbell (all of whose husbands were Episcopal bishops), and Mrs. Florence Rowe (whose husband was vice president of John Hancock Insurance Company)came to lend their support, and the arrest of Mrs. Peabody, the 72 year old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, for attempting to eat at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge in an integrated group, made front page news across the country, and brought the civil rights movement in St. Augustine to the attention of the world.   Widely-publicized activities continued in the ensuing months, as congress saw the longest filibuster against a civil rights bill in its history. Dr. Martin Luther King was arrested at the Monson Motel in St. Augustine on June 11, 1964, the only place in Florida he was arrested. He sent a ""Letter from the St. Augustine Jail"" to a northern supporter, Rabbi Israel Dresner of New Jersey, urging him to recruit others to participate in the movement. This resulted, a week later, in the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history--while conducting a pray-in at the Monson.   The most famous photograph ever taken in St. Augustine shows the manager of the Monson Motel pouring acid in the swimming pool while blacks and whites are swimming in it. That horrifying photograph was run on the front page of the Washington newspaper the day the senate went to vote on passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964.     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964   Main article:  Freedom Summer   In the summer of 1964,  COFO  brought nearly 1,000 activists to Mississippi  most of them white college students  to join with local black activists to register voters, teach in ""Freedom Schools,"" and organize the  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  (MFDP). [ 25 ]   Many of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and attempts to change their society. State and local governments, police, the  White Citizens' Council  and the  Ku Klux Klan  used arrests, beatings, arson, murder, spying, firing, evictions, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality. [ 26 ]   On June 21, 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared.  James Chaney , a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice; and two  Jewish  activists,  Andrew Goodman , a  Queens College  anthropology student; and  Michael Schwerner , a  CORE  organizer from  Manhattan 's  Lower East Side , were found weeks later, murdered by conspirators who turned out to be local members of the Klan, some of them members of the  Neshoba County  sheriff's department. (see  Mississippi civil rights workers murders  for details).   From June to August, Freedom Summer activists worked in 38 local projects scattered across the state, with the largest number concentrated in the  Mississippi Delta  region. At least 30 Freedom Schools, with close to 3,500 students were established, and 28 community centers set up. [ 27 ]   Over the course of the Summer Project, some 17,000 Mississippi blacks attempted to become registered voters in defiance of the red tape and forces of  white supremacy  arrayed against them  only 1,600 (less than 10%) succeeded. But more than 80,000 joined the  MFDP . [ 28 ]           President Johnson  signs the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 .       Though Freedom Summer failed to register many voters, it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of people's isolation and repression that were the foundation of the  Jim Crow  system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. When the lives of affluent northern white students were threatened and taken, the full attention of the media spotlight turned on the state. The apparent disparity between the value which the media placed on the lives of whites and blacks embittered many black activists. Perhaps the most significant effect of Freedom Summer was on the volunteers themselves, almost all of whom  black and white  still consider it to have been one of the defining periods of their lives. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964   Main article:  Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party   Blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised by statutory and constitutional changes since the late 1800s. In 1963 COFO held a Freedom Vote in Mississippi to demonstrate the desire of black Mississippians to vote. More than 80,000 people registered and voted in the mock election which pitted an integrated slate of candidates from the ""Freedom Party"" against the official state Democratic Party candidates. [ 30 ]   In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected  Fannie Lou Hamer , Annie Devine, and Victoria Gray to run for  Congress  and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. [ 25 ]   The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in  Atlantic City, New Jersey , was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson Administrations achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican  Barry Goldwater s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the ""Solid South"", as well as support which  George Wallace  had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.   Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There  Fannie Lou Hamer  testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, ""Is this America?""   Johnson offered the MFDP a ""compromise"" under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the ""compromise.""   The MFDP kept up its agitation within the convention, even after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the ""regular"" Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. They were then removed by the national party. When they returned the next day to find that convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before, they stayed to sing freedom songs.          President  Lyndon B. Johnson  meets with Civil Rights leaders  Martin Luther King, Jr. ,  Whitney Young ,  James Farmer       The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP itself. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited  Malcolm X , of the  Nation of Islam , to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the  war in Vietnam .

[ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Boycott of New Orleans by American Football League players, January 1965   After the  1964  professional  American Football League  season, the  AFL All-Star Game  had been scheduled for early 1965 in  New Orleans '  Tulane Stadium . After numerous black players were refused service by a number of  New Orleans  hotels and businesses, and white cabdrivers refused to carry black passengers, black and white players alike lobbied for a  boycott  of New Orleans. Under the leadership of  Buffalo Bills ' players including  Cookie Gilchrist , the players put up a unified front. The game was moved to  Houston  and its  Jeppesen Stadium .   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  had been signed in July 1964, which likely encouraged the AFL players in their cause. It was the first  boycott  by a professional sports event of an entire city     [ edit ]   Selma and the Voting Rights Act, 1965   Main articles:  Selma to Montgomery marches  and  Voting Rights Act   SNCC  had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in  Selma, Alabama , in 1963, but by 1965 had made little headway in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the  SCLC  for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from police.  Jimmie Lee Jackson , a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march in February. When he heard that Jackson would die,  James Bevel , director of the Selma Movement, initiated a plan to march from Selma to Montgomery.   On March 7, 1965, acting on Bevel's plan,  Hosea Williams  of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, at the  Edmund Pettus Bridge , state troopers and local law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs,  tear gas , rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. John Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was  Amelia Boynton Robinson , who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.   The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response as had scenes from Birmingham two years earlier. The marchers were able to obtain a court order permitting them to make the march without incident two weeks later.   After a second march to the site of Bloody Sunday on March 9, however, local whites murdered another voting rights supporter, Rev.  James Reeb . He died in a Birmingham hospital March 11. On March 25, four Klansmen shot and killed  Detroit  homemaker  Viola Liuzzo  as she drove marchers back to Selma at night after the successfully completed march to Montgomery.   Eight days after the first march, Johnson delivered a televised address to support of the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:     But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.       Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.     Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  on August 6. The 1965 act suspended  poll taxes , literacy tests and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts. If voting discrimination occurred, the 1965 act authorized the  Attorney General of the United States  to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars. Johnson reportedly told his concern to associates that signing the bill had lost the white South for the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future.   The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000, one quarter of a million, new black voters had been registered, one third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout74%and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.   Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966  Sheriff Jim Clark  of Alabama, infamous for using cattle prods against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious ""Never"" pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as Blacks voted to get him out of office.   Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states of the U.S. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every  Black Belt  county (where populations were majority black) in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions within city, county, and state governments.   Atlanta elected a black mayor,  Andrew Young , as did  Jackson, Mississippi  Harvey Johnson and  New Orleans , with  Ernest Morial . Black politicians on the national level included  Barbara Jordan , who represented Texas in Congress, and Andrew Young was appointed  United States Ambassador to the United Nations  during the  Carter administration .  Julian Bond  was elected to the  Georgia Legislature  in 1965, although political reaction to his public  opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam  prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. John Lewis represents  Georgia's 5th congressional district  in the  United States House of Representatives , where he has served since 1987.     [ edit ]   Memphis, King assassination and the Poor People's March, 1968   Main articles:  Poor People's Campaign  and  Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination   Rev. James Lawson invited King to  Memphis, Tennessee , in March 1968 to support a strike by  sanitation  workers. They had launched a campaign for  union  representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job.   A day after delivering his famous ""Mountaintop"" sermon at Lawson's church, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Riots broke out in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably in Chicago,  Baltimore , and  in Washington, D.C.  The damage done in many cities destroyed black businesses. It would take more than a generation for those areas to recover. [ citation needed ]  Some still have not. [ citation needed ]   Rev. Ralph Abernathy succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

Kennedy  speaking to a Civil Rights crowd in front of the  Justice Department  building, June 1963.       During the years preceding his election to the presidency,  John F. Kennedy 's record of voting on issues of racial discrimination had been scant. Kennedy openly confessed to his closest advisors that during the first months of his presidency, his knowledge of the civil rights movement was ""lacking"".   For the first two years of the Kennedy Administration, attitudes to both the President and  Attorney-General ,  Robert F. Kennedy , were mixed. Many viewed the Administration with suspicion. A well of historical cynicism toward white liberal politics had left a sense of uneasy disdain by African-Americans toward any white politician who claimed to share their concerns for freedom. Still, many had a strong sense that in the Kennedys there was a new age of political dialogue beginning.   Although observers frequently assert the phrase ""The Kennedy Administration"" or even, ""President Kennedy"" when discussing the legislative and executive support of the Civil Rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, many of the initiatives were actually the result of Robert Kennedy's passion. Through his rapid education in the realities of racism [ citation needed ] , Robert Kennedy underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney-General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, ""What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?"" Robert Kennedy replied, ""Civil Rights."" [ 32 ]  The President came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters to such an extent that it was at the Attorney-General's insistence that he made his famous address to the nation. [ 33 ] .   When a white mob attacked and burned the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where King held out with protesters, the Attorney-General telephoned King to ask him not to leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard could secure the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for ""allowing the situation to continue"". King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy's commanding the force to break up an attack which might otherwise have ended King's life.   The relationship between the two men underwent change from mutual suspicion to one of shared aspirations. For Dr King, Robert Kennedy initially represented the 'softly softly' approach that in former years had disabled the movement of blacks against oppression in the U.S. For Robert Kennedy, King initially represented what he then considered an unrealistic militancy. Some white liberals regarded the militancy itself as the cause of so little governmental progress.   King regarded much of the efforts of the Kennedys as an attempt to control the movement and siphon off its energies. Yet he came to find the efforts of the brothers to be crucial. It was at Robert Kennedy's constant insistence, through conversations with King and others, that King came to recognize the fundamental nature of electoral reform and suffragethe need for black Americans to actively engage not only protest but political dialogue at the highest levels. In time the President gained King's respect and trust, via the frank dialogue and efforts of the Attorney-General. Robert Kennedy became very much his brother's key advisor on matters of racial equality. The President regarded the issue of civil rights to be a function of the Attorney-General's office.   With a very small majority in Congress, the President's ability to press ahead with legislation relied considerably on a balancing game with the Senators and Congressmen of the South. Indeed, without the support of Vice-President Johnson, who had years of experience in Congress and longstanding relations there, many of the Attorney-General's programs would not have progressed at all.   By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals. King remarked by the end of the year,  ""This administration has reached out more creatively than its predecessors to blaze new trails [in voting rights and government appointments]. Its vigorous young men have launched imaginative and bold forays and displayed a certain lan in the attention they give to civil rights issues."" [ 34 ]   From squaring off against Governor  George Wallace , to ""tearing into"" Vice-President Johnson (for failing to desegregate areas of the administration), to threatening corrupt white Southern judges with disbarment, to desegregating interstate transport, Robert Kennedy came to be consumed by the Civil Rights movement. He carried it forward into his own bid for the presidency in 1968. On the night of Governor Wallace's capitulation, President Kennedy gave an address to the nation which marked the changing tide, an address which was to become a landmark for the change in political policy which ensued. In it President Kennedy spoke of the need to act decisively and to act now:   ""We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.""   [4] .   Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform had been driven home on  Capitol Hill  by the combined efforts of the Kennedy administration, Dr. King and other leaders, and President Lyndon Johnson.   In 1966, Robert Kennedy undertook a tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti- Apartheid  movement. His tour gained international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population. He was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with  LOOK  Magazine he said:   ""At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.  ""But suppose God is black"" , I replied.  ""What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?""  There was no answer. Only silence."" [ 35 ]     [ edit ]   American Jewish community and the Civil Rights movement   Many in the  Jewish-American  community supported the Civil Rights Movement and Jews were more actively involved in the civil rights movement than any other white group in America. Many  Jewish  students worked in concert with African Americans for CORE, SCLC, and SNCC as full-time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era. Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi  Freedom Summer  project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s. [ 36 ]   Jewish leaders were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  St. Augustine, Florida , in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations.  Abraham Joshua Heschel , a writer, rabbi and professor of theology at the  Jewish Theological Seminary of America  in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights. He marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in the 1965 March on Selma.   Brandeis University , the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored college university in the world, created the Transitional Year Program (TYP)in 1968, in part response to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. The faculty created it to renew the University's commitment to social justice. Recognizing Brandeis as a university with a commitment to academic excellence, these faculty members created a chance to disadvantaged students to participate in an empowering educational experience.   The program began by admitting 20 black males. As it developed, two groups have been given chances. The first group consists of students whose secondary schooling experiences and/or home communities may have lacked the resources to foster adequate preparation for success at elite colleges like Brandeis. For example, their high schools do not offer AP or honors courses nor high quality laboratory experiences. Students selected had to have excelled in the curricula offered by their schools.   The second group of students includes those whose life circumstances have created formidable challenges that required focus, energy, and skills that otherwise would have been devoted to academic pursuits. Some have served as heads of their households, others have worked full-time while attending high school full-time, and others have shown leadership in other ways.   The  American Jewish Committee ,  American Jewish Congress , and  Anti-Defamation League  actively promoted civil rights.     [ edit ]   Fraying of alliances   King reached the height of popular acclaim during his life in 1964, when he was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize . His career after that point was filled with frustrating challenges. The liberal coalition that had gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 2 ]  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 began to fray.   King was becoming more estranged from the Johnson Administration. In 1965 he broke with it by calling for peace negotiations and a halt to the bombing of Vietnam. He moved further left in the following years, speaking of the need for economic justice and thoroughgoing changes in American society. He believed change was needed beyond the civil rights gained by the movement.   King's attempts to broaden the scope of the Civil Rights Movement were halting and largely unsuccessful, however. King made several efforts in 1965 to take the Movement north to address issues of employment and housing discrimination. SCLC's campaign in Chicago publicly failed, as Chicago Mayor  Richard J. Daley  marginalized SCLC's campaign by promising to ""study"" the city's problems. In 1966, white demonstrators holding ""white power"" signs in notoriously racist  Cicero , a suburb of Chicago, threw stones at marchers demonstrating against housing segregation.     [ edit ]   Race riots, 1963-1970   See also:  Mass racial violence in the United States   By the end of  World War II , more than half of the country's black population lived in Northern and Western industrial cities rather than Southern rural areas. [ citation needed ]  Migrating to those cities for better job opportunities, education and to escape legal segregation, African Americans often found segregation that existed in fact rather than in law.   While after the 1920s, the  Ku Klux Klan  was not prevalent, by the 1960s other problems prevailed in northern cities. Beginning in the 1950s, there had been deindustrialization and restructuring of major areas of the economies: railroads and meatpacking, steel industry and car industry. As the last population to enter the industrial job market, blacks were disadvantaged by its collapse. At the same time, investment in highways and private development of suburbs in the postwar years had drawn many ethnic whites out of the cities to newer housing in expanding suburbs. Urban blacks who did not follow the middle class out of the cities became concentrated in the older housing of inner-city neighborhoods, among the poorest in most major cities. Because jobs in new service areas and parts of the economy were being created in suburbs, unemployment was much higher in many black than in white neighborhoods, and crime was frequent. African Americans rarely owned the stores or businesses where they lived. Many were limited to menial or blue-collar jobs, although union organizing in the 1930s and 1940s had opened up good working environments for some. African Americans often made only enough money to live in dilapidated tenements that were privately owned, or poorly maintained public housing. They also attended schools that were often the worst academically in the city and that had fewer white students than in the decades before WWII.   The police forces in America were set up with the motto ""To Protect and Serve."" Rarely did this occur in any black neighborhoods. Rather, many blacks felt police only existed to ""Patrol and Control."" [ citation needed ]  The racial makeup of the police departments, usually largely white, was a large factor. In black neighborhoods such as Harlem, the ratio was only one black officer for every six white officers, [ 37 ]  and in majority black cities such as  Newark, New Jersey  only 145 of the 1322 police officers were black. [ 38 ]  Police forces in Northern cities were largely composed of white ethnics, descendants of 19th century immigrants: mainly Irish, Italian, and Eastern European officers. They had established their own power bases in the police departments and in territories in cities. Some would routinely harass blacks with or without provocation. [ 39 ]   One of the first major race riots took place in  Harlem , New York, in the summer of 1964. A white Irish-American police officer, Thomas Gilligan, shot 15-year-old James Powell, who was black, for allegedly charging at him with a knife. In fact, Powell was unarmed. A group of black citizens demanded Gilligan's suspension. Hundreds of young demonstrators marched peacefully to the 67th Street police station on July 17, 1964, the day after Powell's death.  [5]   Gilligan was not suspended. Although this precinct had promoted the  NYPD 's first black station commander, neighborhood residents were tired of the inequalities. They looted and burned anything that was not black-owned in the neighborhood. This unrest spread to  Bedford-Stuyvesant , a major black neighborhood in  Brooklyn . That summer,  rioting also broke out in Philadelphia , for similar reasons.   In the aftermath of the riots of July 1964, the federal government funded a pilot program called  Project Uplift , in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by  HARYOU  called  Youth in the Ghetto . [ 40 ]  HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, together with the  National Urban League  and nearly 100 smaller community organizations. [ 41 ]  Permanent jobs at living wages, however, were still out of reach of many young black men.   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, but the new law had no immediate effect on living conditions for blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the  South Central  Los Angeles neighborhood of  Watts . Like Harlem, Watts was an impoverished neighborhood with very high unemployment. Its residents had to endure patrols by a largely white police department. While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The conflict triggered a massive destruction of property through six days of rioting. Thirty-four people were killed and property valued at about $30 million was destroyed, making the  Watts riot  one of the worst in American history.   With black militancy on the rise, increased acts of anger were now directed at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the  Black Panthers , whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers.   Riots occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as  Atlanta ,  San Francisco ,  Oakland ,  Baltimore ,  Seattle ,  Cleveland ,  Cincinnati ,  Columbus ,  Newark , Chicago, New York City (specifically in  Brooklyn , Harlem and the  Bronx ), and worst of all in  Detroit .   In Detroit, a comfortable  black middle class  had begun to develop among families of blacks who worked at well-paying jobs in the  automotive industry . [ citation needed ]  Blacks who had not moved upward were living in much worse conditions, subject to the same problems as blacks in Watts and Harlem. When white police officers shut down an illegal bar on a liquor raid and arrested a large group of patrons, furious residents rioted.   One significant effect of the  Detroit riot  was the acceleration of "" white flight ,"" the trend of white residents moving from inner-city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburbs. Detroit experienced ""middle class black flight"" as well. Cities such as Detroit, Newark, and Baltimore now have less than 40% white population as a result of these riots and other social changes. Changes in industry caused continued job losses, depopulation of middle classes, and concentrated poverty in such cities. They contain some of the worst living conditions for blacks anywhere in America. [ citation needed ]   As a result of the riots, President Johnson created the  National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders  in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.   Fresh rioting broke out in April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Riots erupted in many major cities at once, including Chicago, Cleveland,  Baltimore ,  Washington, D.C. ,  West Side Riots  in  Chicago, Illinois ,  1968 New York City riot  and  Louisville riots of 1968 .   Affirmative Action  altered the hiring process of more black police officers in every major city. Blacks make up a proportional majority of the police departments in cities such as Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Atlanta, Newark, and Detroit. Civil rights laws have reduced employment discrimination. The conditions that led to frequent rioting in the late 1960s have receded, but not all the problems have been solved.   With industrial and economic restructuring, tens of thousands of industrial jobs disappeared since the later 1950s from the old industrial cities. Some moved South, as has much population, and others out of the US altogether. Civil unrest broke out in  Miami in 1980 , in  Los Angeles in 1992 , and in  Cincinnati in 2001 .     [ edit ]   Black power, 1966   Main article:  Black Power          A statue honoring Carlos and Smith at  San Jos State University       At the same time King was finding himself at odds with factions of the Democratic Party, he was facing challenges from within the Civil Rights Movement to the two key tenets upon which the movement had been based: integration and non-violence. Black activists within SNCC and CORE had chafed for some time at the influence wielded by white advisors to civil rights organizations and the disproportionate attention that was given to the deaths of white civil rights workers while black workers' deaths often went virtually unnoticed. Stokely Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the earliest and most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the ""Black Power"" movement after he used that slogan, coined by activist and organizer  Willie Ricks , in  Greenwood, Mississippi  on June 17, 1966.   In 1966 SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael began urging African American communities to confront the Ku Klux Klan armed and ready for battle. He felt it was the only way to ever rid the communities of the terror caused by the Klan. [ citation needed ]   Several people engaging in the Black Power movement started to gain more of a sense in black pride and identity as well. In gaining more of a sense of a cultural identity, several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as ""Negroes"" but as ""Afro-Americans."" Up until the mid-1960s, blacks had dressed similarly to whites and combed their hair straight. As a part of gaining a unique identity, blacks started to wear loosely fit  dashikis  and had started to grow their hair out as a natural  afro . The afro, sometimes nicknamed the ""'fro,"" remained a popular black hairstyle until the late 1970s.   Black Power was made most public however by the  Black Panther Party  which founded in  Oakland, California , in 1966. This group followed ideology stated by  Malcolm X  and the  Nation of Islam  using a ""by-any-means necessary"" approach to stopping inequality. They sought to rid African American neighborhoods of  Police Brutality  and had a ten-point plan amongst other things. Their dress code consisted of leather jackets, berets, light blue shirts, and an afro hairstyle. They are best remembered for setting up free breakfast programs, referring to police officers as ""pigs"", displaying shotguns and a black power fist, and often using the statement of "" Power to the people .""   Black Power was taken to another level inside of prison walls. In 1966,  George Jackson  formed the  Black Guerilla Family  in the California prison of  San Quentin . The goal of this group was to overthrow the white-run government in America and the prison system in general. In 1970, this group displayed their dedication after a white prison guard was found not guilty for shooting three black prisoners from the prison tower. The guard was found cut to pieces, and a message was sent throughout the whole prison of how serious the group was.   Also in 1968,  Tommie Smith  and  John Carlos , while being awarded the gold and bronze medals, respectively, at the  1968 Summer Olympics , donned human rights badges and each raised a black-gloved Black Power salute during their podium ceremony. Incidentally, it was the suggestion of white silver medalist,  Peter Norman  of Australia, for Smith and Carlos to each wear one black glove. Smith and Carlos were immediately ejected from the games by the  USOC , and later the  IOC  issued a permanent lifetime ban for the two. However, the Black Power movement had been given a stage on live, international television.   King was not comfortable with the ""Black Power"" slogan, which sounded too much like black nationalism to him. SNCC activists, in the meantime, began embracing the ""right to self-defense"" in response to attacks from white authorities, and booed King for continuing to advocate non-violence. When King was murdered in 1968, Stokely Carmichael stated that whites murdered the one person who would prevent rampant rioting and burning of major cities down and that blacks would burn every major city to the ground. In every major city from  Boston  to  San Francisco , racial riots broke out in the black community following King's death and as a result, ""White Flight"" occurred from several cities leaving Blacks in a dilapidated and nearly unrepairable city.     [ edit ]   Prison reform     [ edit ]   Gates v. Collier   Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman , then known as Parchman Farm, is also known for the part it played in the United States  Civil Rights Movement . In the spring of 1961, Freedom Riders came to the South to test the  desegregation  of public facilities. By the end of June, 163 Freedom Riders had been convicted in  Jackson, Mississippi . [ 42 ]  Many were jailed in  Mississippi State Penitentiary  at  Parchman . Mississippi employed the  trusty system , a hierarchical order of inmates that used some inmates to control and enforce punishment of other inmates. [ 43 ]   In 1970 Civil Rights lawyer Roy Haber began taking statements from inmates, which eventually totalled fifty pages of details of murders, rapes, beatings and other abuses suffered by the inmates from 1969 to 1971 at Mississippi State Penitentiary. In a  landmark case  known as  Gates v. Collier  (1972) four inmates represented by Haber sued the superintendent of Parchman Farm for violating their rights under the  United States Constitution . Federal Judge William C. Keady found in favor of the inmates, writing that Parchman Farm violated the civil rights of the inmates by inflicting  cruel and unusual punishment . He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices. Racial segregation of inmates was abolished. And the trustee system, which allow certain inmates to have power and control over others, was also abolished. [ 44 ]   The prison was renovated in 1972 after the scathing ruling by Judge Keady in which he wrote that the prison was an affront to ""modern standards of decency."" Among other reforms, the accommodations were made fit for human habitation and the system of ""trusties"" (in which  lifers  were armed with rifles and set to guard other inmates) was abolished.  [ 45 ]   In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states, blacks represented a disproportionate amount of the prisoners and were often treated as second class citizens at the hands of white correctional officers. Blacks also represented a disproportionate number of death row inmates. As a result, Black Power found a ready constituency inside prison walls where gangs such as the  Black Guerilla Family  were formed as a way to redress the disproportionalities, organizing Black inmates to take militant action.  Eldridge Cleaver 's book  Soul on Ice  was written from his experiences in the California correctional system and further fueled black militancy. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Cold War   See also:  The Communist Party and African-Americans   There was an international context for the actions of the U.S. Federal government during these years. It had stature to maintain in Europe and a need to appeal to the people in  Third World .  [ 47 ]  In  Cold War Civil Rights:Race and the Image of American Democracy , historian Mary L. Dudziak showed how, in the ideological battle of the  Cold War ,  Communist  critics could easily point out the hypocrisy of the United States's portrayal of itself as the ""leader of the free world"" when so many of its citizens were the object of racial discrimination. She argued that this was a major factor in pushing the government to support civil rights legislation.

By Andrew Ritchie and John Small        I simply returned a call from my stockbroker. Based in large part on prior discussions with my broker about price, I authorized a sale of my remaining shares in a biotech company called ImClone .The government's attempt to criminalize these actions makes no sense to me.'              - Martha Stewart, from MarthaTalks.com              U.S. Attorney James B. Comey says that this case is about lying. In a strange way, he is absolutely correct; we were told that the Martha Stewart investigation was about insider trading. The media told us that Martha had received a tip from her CEO friend Sam Waksal. They even told us that Martha scares away young children on her porch on Halloween and uses her SUV to push around her neighbors handyman. The NY Times told us her company was looking for a new CEO.

MarthaTalks.com           Send Martha some words of support                       As it turns out, all of these things turned out to be untrue. That did not stop over 90% of Rice University students from saying in a recent poll that they think Martha Stewart is guilty of insider trading, a crime for which James Comey did not even charge her. Whether you like Martha Stewart or not, she is an American citizen, and is presumed inocent until proven guilty. Lets let the facts decide the truth in this case; here's what we do know;               On December 27th, 2001, Peter Bacanovic was on vacation in Miami, and Martha Stewart was flying to Mexico for a vacation.              Peter Bacanovic was the broker of both Martha Stewart and ImClone CEO Sam Waksal.              Between 9 and 10 a.m., Bacanovic's assistant at Merrill Lynch, Douglas Faneuil, received a request from the daughter of ImClone's CEO, Sam Waksal, to sell all of the ImClone stock in her account.              Douglas Faneuil also received a request in writing from Sam Waksal to transfer all of the ImClone stock in his account. The request was marked ""URGENT—IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED.""              Some time round 10 a.m., Douglas Faneuil told his boss Peter Bacanovic about Waksal's daughter's sale and Waksal's attempted sale of their ImClone stock.              In total these shares were worth $7.3 million, a tiny fraction (about 2%) of Sam Waksals holdings in his company.              Sam’s daughter Alizas shares were sold for $2.5 million; following SEC rules, Merrill Lynch refused to sell the remaining $4.8 million of the shares since they belonged Sam Waksal, who was the ImClone CEO.              At 10:04 am, with ImClone trading at approximately $61.50,               Peter Bacanovic left a message that Stewart's assistant, Ann Armstrong, which said ""Peter Bacanovic thinks ImClone is going to start trading downward.""              Contrary to early news reports of Martha receiving an insider tip from her CEO friend Sam Waksal, she was traveling to Mexico, unaware of the frantic selling going on back in New York.              Three hours later, at 1:26 p.m. ET, Stewart's private jet landed in San Antonio, Texas, to refuel. Martha Stewart checked her messages and then returned a call from her stockbroker’s office at Merrill Lynch. At 1:39, Armstrong patched Stewart through to Bacanovic's office and hung up              The prosecution alleges that Martha Stewart was told that stock in ImClone was trading very heavily and that members of Sam Waksal’s family were selling.              What they do not point out is that two months earlier, in a tender offer form Bristol Myers, Martha Stewart had already tried to sell all of her ImClone stock for $70 per share. But the tender offer was so oversubscribed; Bristol-Myers purchased only 21 percent of the tendered shares, leaving Stewart with 3,928 shares.               Why was everyone selling ImClone?        It is also important to note that on December 27th, trading volume on ImClone was skyrocketing to 7 million shares vs. just 1.5 million shares the day before, and the price was headed down on heavy volume. It is also important to note that by the time Martha returned this call form her broker, ImClone's stock was down about $5 from its opening price, or roughly 10 percent, on five times its usual trading volume. In fact, ImClone had seen several days of unusually heavy trading (5 million shares vs. the avg. 1.5 million) the week of December 17th, as the stock slipped from $70 to the low $60s. Any reasonable investor would be concerned, and they were; that day seven million shares were trading.        At 1:41 p.m., just two minutes after being transferred to Faneuil, Martha hung up. Merrill Lynch completed her sell order shortly thereafter, at an average sale price of about $58. The closing price for the day was $58.30.              At 1:41 p.m., after placing her sell order with Faneuil Martha then called Sam Waksal and left a message on his machine. His assistant later summarized it on a memo pad: ""Martha Stewart. Something is going on with ImClone and she wants to know what."" He never returned her call.              This is a crucial part of the timeline as it seems to prove several key points: First, it shows that contrary to all initial news reports, Martha Stewart did not receive a tip to sell directly from Sam Waksal; in fact she was concerned enough about the heavy trading and stock price decline that she called him directly to find out what was happening.              Second, contrary to rumors surrounding the congressional investigation, it indicates that Martha Stewart did not know is that the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) was going to reject the application by ImClone for its new cancer-fighting drug called Erbitux the very next day . In fact, many shareholders had already dumped the stock ahead of both the announcement and of Martha Stewart selling. Over 7 million shares were traded that day, and Martha Stewart traded just 3,928 of them. By selling that day, Martha saved a mere $45,000.              In contrast, Sam Waksal did have advanced notice about the FDA rejection and used that information to make improper sales of his own shares, as well as tip off several family members to sell.              Phone records have indicated, however, that Martha and Sam did not talk that day, therefore making it impossible for Martha to have received direct insider information about the FDA rejection of Erbitux.              Waksal was later indicted and found guilty of insider trading, among other charges, and is currently serving a seven-year sentence behind bars.              After more than a year of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the federal government, Martha was not criminally charged with insider trading but was, however, sued by the SEC for the alleged crime.              The government criminally indicted Martha with securities fraud, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and two counts of making false statements, but not with insider trading. Her stock broker, Peter Bacanovic, was simultaneously charged with conspiracy, obstruction and perjury.               The SEC’s Civil Complaint: Why Martha?              Seven million shares of ImClone stock were sold the same day that Martha sold her paltry sum of 3,928. It begs the question: Where are the other ImClone investigations?              Among the people who sold that day were two close friends of Sam Waksal. One of them sold $600,000 worth of ImClone stock and the other sold $30 million worth. Phone records show these sales took place ‘almost immediately’ after these men had contact with Waksal. Neither of these men has been publicly named by federal investigators and neither has been charged.              Another seller was the husband of Martha’s friend Mariana Pasternak, who was with Martha on December 27th, 2001. He sold 10,000 shares and was not questioned by investigators. Even Waksal’s daughter, Aliza, who admitted to having received information from her father to sell that day, escaped prosecution and kept the profits of her sale.               The power of celebrity              So, why are Martha and her broker being sued by the SEC in the ImClone case while other, more suspicious traders are not? Why proceed with the civil charges when the case is so incredibly weak?              For one thing, Martha is a celebrity and the public attention the SEC gains by suing a well-known personality is immeasurable. The fact that her broker, Peter Bacanovic, is also being sued seems incidental when compared to the array of headlines the name ""Martha Stewart"" has garnered for the SEC.              High visibility means high profile and extensive coverage. In a time when faith in the American economy is shaky and corporate criminals abound, it serves an agency like the SEC well to sue a popular person like Martha Stewart, whether she is guilty of a crime or not. Who, in all of America, after all, does not know the name Martha Stewart?              By charging her, the SEC gives the impression that it is serving its function: supposedly preserving the integrity of the markets. The fact is that corporate fraud has not declined and continues to infect new sectors every day; look to the growing mutual fund scandal, Grassos $195 million pay package, and the fact that Enrons Ken Lay has still not been charged with a single crime.              Who would care if Mary Nobody or Bob Joe-Blow were sued by the SEC? Would their charges be splashed in bold ink across dozens of newspapers and magazines? Of course not. But a name with the cachet and allure of Martha Stewart brings headlines, which in turn brings visibility to an agency that has felt pressure to appear to be serving its purpose in a faltering financial system maligned by mistrust.              It appears their strategy is working. In a June survey by the Sienna Research Institute, 60 percent of those polled thought Martha was guilty of insider trading, even after she was not criminally charged with the crime.               Loose Laws              To complicate matters for Martha, and make it easier for the SEC, the government likes to define insider trading on a case by case basis, making the courts a trial-and-error testing ground that is extremely dangerous for any defendant.              The laws defining insider trading in America are so obscure, and can be bent in so many directions, that even the most skilled traders could wind up unwittingly making illegal trades, depending on how the vague laws are twisted to prove so.              The idea that Martha ""should have known better"" because she was once a Wall Street trader is absurd, given the murky definitions of trading laws and their case-by-case amendments.              The most clearly defined violators of insider trading laws have been those who have fiduciary responsibility, meaning they are somehow connected to the public company whose shares have been traded in a questionable manner: a CEO, a vice president, a general manager.              For example, as ImClone’s founder and CEO, Sam Waksal had a very clear fiduciary duty with ImClone and blatantly used foreknowledge of an event that would affect his company's stock price to save himself a lot of money.              Martha had no fiduciary responsibility with ImClone, meaning she was not a staff member of the company. She was an outside party who was operating her sale based on information given to her by her stockbroker, which logic would usually define as entirely routine and lawful.              What's more, Martha merely returned a phone call from her stock broker, whose assistant happened to mention that ImClone was trading heavily that day and that the Waksals were selling. He asked her if she would like to sell. Martha said yes. She was simply being a ""diligent business person,"" as she told Barbara Walters on ""20/20"" November 7.              What illuminating volume of trading law could have helped Martha make a more enlightened decision? None. Her stockbroker and his assistant should have been held accountable for violating Merrill Lynch policy if they told Martha the Waksals were selling. But to charge the broker AND his client with insider trading is a vast stretch.              In an unfortunate twist of circumstance she made the call on a day when her good friend Sam Waksal was telling his family to dump shares before the FDA ruling. For Martha, it was guilt by association.              The SEC has no concrete evidence to support its law suit of Martha and Peter for insider trading, but the burden of proof in civil trials is far less than in a criminal trial and there is nothing stopping the SEC from suing, even if they have little to go on. And so, the SEC pursued the case for well over a year, using taxpayer dollars to fund the investigation.              No matter how the case pans out, it remains a historic one.  Reason magazine  pointed out: ""Before suing Martha, the SEC had never gone after the customer of a broker who offered his knowledge of what another customer had done as a reason to make a trade.""              The only reason we can see for the prosecution of Martha Stewart by the SEC is that it looks good on paper. Or perhaps more aptly,  it looks good in the papers.               What's At Stake:         If Martha Stewart and Peter Bacanovic are found guilty of the civil charge of insider trading, they would be required to pay back their sale profits, pay monetary fines and succumb to civil penalties: Martha may be barred from running a publicly traded company ever again, and Peter could have his trading license permanently revoked.               The Criminal Case: Grasping at Straws and Undemocratic              Since the government could not charge Martha Stewart with insider trading, based on a sheer lack of evidence, they decided to go after her for other alleged misdeeds.              What they did was charge her with obstructing an investigation that eventually found her to be innocent. They also charged her with pleading her innocence while the investigation was going on and decided to label it ""securities fraud."" It apparently didn't matter that Martha’s First Amendment right may be at risk of violation or that in most democratic nations one is innocent until proven guilty and has the right to assert that belief publicly.              They charged her with conspiracy because the ink on one part of a spreadsheet did not match the ink on another part of a spreadsheet in Peter Bacanovic’s office. They charged her, twice, for lying to investigators.        It should be restated that the initial investigation, which was looking for evidence to support an insider-trading charge for Martha and Peter, found nothing damaging at all, even after a year of digging.               First Amendment at Risk              The unprecedented steps the government took on June 4, 2003, in the wake of their embarrassing findings the first time around, should leave most Americans wondering why Martha Stewart has been subjected to this incredible level of scrutiny for a single stock transaction.        The most troubling charge against Martha is that of securities fraud, which hinges on the belief that Martha was committing a crime for saying she was innocent.              After ""sources close to a congressional investigation"" leaked rumors about the investigation into her affairs, the press ate it up, tearing apart the reputation of a woman who had not been formally charged.              Martha, who had no control over these leaks or the voracious appetite of the media, decided she should remind people that she was innocent until proven guilty.              As Reason magazine puts it: ""This was done, the feds say, not for the purpose of clearing her name, but only to prop up the stock price of her own publicly traded company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. In other words, her crime is claiming to be innocent of a crime she was never charged with.""              Ironically, Martha would not have had to have publicly declared her innocence if these unnamed sources close to the investigation had kept their mouths shut.              By calling her actions ""securities fraud"" the government is asserting that anyone who runs a publicly traded company had better keep quiet about their assumed innocence if they happen to be under investigation and just take it on the chin.              In Martha’s case, they are stretching the definition of the crime to the absolute limits of democratic freedom.              It is no wonder that her lawyers, Robert Morvillo and John Tigue, had tried to have this charge kicked to the curb.              In their 122-page memorandum to the judge, filed on October 6, 2003, they say:              ""Count Nine, the ‘securities fraud’ charge, seeks to criminalize Ms. Stewart's public declarations that she had not engaged in insider trading in making a personal stock sale. This charge is unprecedented in the seventy-year history of the federal securities laws. It violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the securities statute itself.""              The other charge that her lawyers sought to dismiss is obstruction of justice. In the same memorandum her lawyers write:              ""Count Eight, called ‘obstruction of justice’ by the prosecution (even though it is not based on the obstruction of justice statute), must be dismissed because none of Ms. Stewart's statements could have hindered the SEC investigation and the Indictment does not adequately allege that she was even aware of the SEC investigation when the statements were made.""              Her lawyers also tried to have some of the examples of her ""false statements"" dismissed because they were immaterial to the investigations and were presented to the judge in an inflammatory manner.              All charges will stand, however, as Judge Cedarbaum determined that it will be up to the jury to decide the validity of the charges, noting, however, that the governments Count Nine is a ""novel"" interpretation of securities laws.              This leaves conspiracy as the most damaging charge against Martha.              The prosecution is alleging that she and Peter Bacanovic conspired to cover up their alleged insider trading by tampering with records while the investigation was going on. Even though the investigation yielded no crime, they are being charged with trying to cover it up, which flies in the face of rationality.               The Prosecution’s Evidence              In fact, the prosecution’s evidence against Martha and Peter is extremely weak, as has been noted by Judge John Sprizzo, a judge overseeing a shareholder suit against MSO.              The prosecution’s star witness is Peter Bacanovic’s assistant, Douglas Faneuil, who executed Martha’s sale that fateful day. He copped a plea with the prosecutors, after initially backing up Martha’s story, in exchange for immunity and a slap on the wrist. He now says he was bribed to corroborate with Martha.              Backing up Faneuil’s latest version of events is a New York gossip columnist named Robert Haskell whom he reportedly spoke to about the case. It has been duly noted by the press that neither gossip columnists nor a man who changes his story to cop a plea do not make the most credible witnesses.              Other witnesses who will testify against Martha include two SEC lawyers. Their agenda is to protect the validity of the SEC as a viable guardian of ethical trading, even though their trading laws are vague to the point of transparency and can be shaped by lawyers to suit anyones interests.              Then there is the ink issue.              The prosecution alleges that Peter added ""@60"" for Martha’s ImClone holdings on a spreadsheet he used to keep track of Martha’s various portfolio decisions, after the investigation had begun. The ""@60"" is a reference to an agreement he had with Martha to sell her ImClone stock if it fell below $60 a share, as it did on December 27th, 2001, the day Martha made her sale.              The government says there was no agreement to sell the shares if they traded below $60 and says the ink in this spot of the page does not match the ink on another spot of the page and is therefore an indication that it was written after the investigation into the ImClone trades had begun. Forensic experts say, however, that it is impossible to tell when the ""@60"" was written.              The most damaging evidence against Martha is a documented attempt to temporarily change an entry in her telephone log. She allegedly asked her assistant to change it from, ""Peter Bacanovic thinks ImClone is going to start trading downward"" to ""Peter Bacanovic. Re: ImClone."" She had second thoughts, however, and called her assistant to change it back to its original form.              The prosecution will allege that this is evidence of Martha’s guilty conscious at work. But as Reason magazine argues:              ""This aborted tampering with evidence does not prove Stewart was guilty, but does illustrate the uncertainty created by the government’s murky insider trading laws.""              There is absolutely nothing illegal with writing a memo saying your stockbroker thinks a certain stock will begin to lose value; is it not a stockbroker’s job to inform clients of potential risks in investments? That she changed the log only proves that she was nervous and unsure of the current, popular interpretation of securities laws. That she changed it back to its original form proves she had good conscience and wanted to do the right thing.              In a recent revelation, the judge in the case ordered the prosecution to submit its list of co-conspirators who had, up until now, remained secret. It also came to light, during the pre-trial hearing held November 18, that the prosecution had seized 17 hard drives from Martha’s company headquarters in Manhattan and had yet to search them for possible evidence against Martha.              Multitudes of people will be watching this case closely, not only to await the fate of the world’s most famous homemaker, but also to see if democracy will prevail.              What’s at Stake: If Martha Stewart is found guilty of all charges she could face a 30-year prison term and a $2 million fine. Her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, would face severe risk of collapsing in the wake of such a verdict, bringing an end to thousands of jobs. If Peter Bacanovic is found guilty of all charges he also faces a prison term and a hefty fine.              The truth is a bit more complicated than most news headlines would lead you to believe. However, the facts strongly support Martha Stewart's case, and a fair minded jury would have to conclude that this case was in fact one of the greatest witchhunts in American history.

December 22, 2008  - by  B. Daniel Blatt                                                      Support Pajamas Media; Visit Our Advertisers                                               Like other gay Republicans, I have been amused by the brouhaha among gay activists, bloggers, and their allies on the left over President-elect Obama’s choice of Pastor Rick Warren, a proponent of Proposition 8 which bars the state of California from recognizing same-sex marriages, to offer the invocation at his inauguration.   Unlike some of my ideological confrres, I don’t see this as a sign that he has thrown his gay supporters under the bus.   Gay activists, however, are up in arms. In a  statement responding to Obama’s selection of Warren , Darrel Cummings, L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center chief of staff, contended:   If President-elect Obamas selection of Rick Warren to give his inaugural invocation is intended to send a message to America that he will be an inclusive leader, then he has clearly made a decision that the exclusion of the LGBT community is acceptable.   Excluding gay people? Hardly.   Immediately following Obama’s swearing-in, the Lesbian and Gay Band Alliance (LGBA) will be the “ first ever gay contingent ” to march in a presidential inaugural parade. To be sure, the invocation is a much more significant than participation in the festivities following the official ceremony, but that inclusion does undercut the argument that the inclusion of Warren means the president-elect has excluded gays.   The presence of that band won’t mollify some on the left. Writing inthe  Nation , Sarah Posner offers a  similar assessment :   Obama’s religious outreach was intended, supposedly, to make religious voters more comfortable with him and feel included in the Democratic Party. But that outreach now has come at the expense of other people’s comfort and inclusion, at an event meant to mark a turning point away from divisive politics.   In a  letter to the president-elect , Joe Solmonese, president of Human Rights Campaign, which bills itself as “the nations largest gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender civil rights organization,” concurs:   Your invitation to Reverend Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at your inauguration is a genuine blow to LGBT Americans. Our loss in California over the passage of Proposition 8 which stripped loving, committed same-sex couples of their given legal right to marry is the greatest loss our community has faced in 40 years. And by inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration, you have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans have a place at your table.   So, the inclusion of one man in the inaugural ceremonies who opposes gay marriage must necessarily mean the exclusion of gay people altogether?            Pages:  1 2 Next                    B.

Mark Epstein :      “Its unfortunate that some gay activists (and their allies on the left) have let their disagreement with the prominent pastor on this one issue color their reaction to the president-elects choice. To be sure, had Warren expressed his support of Proposition 8 in the hateful tones of some of the propositions proponents, these activists would have a point.”   It is encouraging to read the word “some” in your post. Not everyone who opposes gay marriage are hate-filled, just as not everyone in the gay community reacted poorly to the passing of Proposition 8. Often the problem is the gay community’s liberal heterosexual supporters who are enraged at any disagreement with the liberal world view. That is why nearly all of my articles concerning the reaction to Proposition 8 includes the liberals and leftists who disingenuously use the support of gay marriage as another excuse to rabidly bash ideologic opponents.   The African American community is just as problematic. I agree with those who argue that minority civil rights are not akin to gay rights. However, the pastors who do support gay marriage are just as luke warm on other traditional biblical positions, which then begs the question concerning their commitment to their source document (the Bible).   Then there’s the behavior of the Farrakhans, Jeremiah Wrights, and Joseph Lowerys of the world…   Gay Rage Part VI: Terrorist Hypocrites of a Feather      Dec 22, 2008 - 2:37 am            2.  Bob:      It’s always the same story with the left, regardless of the issue.  They expect everyone to “reach out” to them; they have no interest in reaching out to others.  To the left, bipartisanship means Republicans agreeing withe the Democrat agenda.  It was fine when Rick Warren invited Sen. Obama to speak at his evangelical church even though they didn’t agree on all issues.  But when the President-elect returns the favor by inviting Warren to give a prayer at the inauguration, that’s an unspeakable outrage.  Even though he carried only 53.5% of the popular vote, Mr. Obama will be President of all the people, gay, straight, conservative and liberal.  I didn’t support “The One” but am willing to cut him a little slack and hope that his presidency will be successful, and that our country will prosper while he’s at the helm of the ship of state.      Dec 22, 2008 - 4:09 am            3.  syn:      The Left uses identity politics as a permanent pipeline for campaign funds-from Climate Change to Gay Marriage to Class warfare to Gender-bending, the Left keeps these identities aggrieved, angered and feeling hopeless in order to secure the money needed to obtain power.   Those who subscribe to the Democrat Party’s Slave Plantation are being played for fools by their illiberal Slave Masters who make promises they’ll never keep while sending their slaves back to the fields to slave labor for more campaign funds.   Vicious cycle.      Dec 22, 2008 - 5:03 am            4.   Peg :      Nice column, Dan.  Too bad that the more extreme leftists don’t appreciate that having someone like Warren speak actually furthers their cause.  Although Warren isn’t pro-gay marriage, he absolutely is no hate monger.   Gay marriage will come about not when the radical left is convinced it is right. It will come about when more people in the middle and on the right get to know gay folks and appreciate that, in the meaningful ways, they are no different from straight people.  Having “one of their own” like Warren appear at Obama’s inauguration furthers this.   Although people may want something desperately (and rightly so) - changes in culture do not happen overnight.  A bit more patience and dignity - as MLK demonstrated for the black community - would help.      Dec 22, 2008 - 6:36 am            5.  therealist:      We know how it is.  If you even talk to someone who who doesn’t believe in their cause you’re a knuckle dragging bigot.      Dec 22, 2008 - 8:56 am            6.   Michael Ejercito :      I wonder if they would have accepted   Larry Elder   giving the invocation speech.     Or would they have found some other problem with him.      Dec 22, 2008 - 9:43 am            7.  Bugs:      I long ago ceased thinking of LGBT people as a victim class. In general, they seem to be doing rather well for themselves - always have, in fact. Frankly, they appear to be one of the wealthiest, most influential “minorities” in the country. So their emotional and lifestyle issues seem less important to me than the real problems confronting our country today. Certainly they are entitled to express their dismay at Obama’s choice of reverends. But pardon me if I don’t weep over its supposed “chilling effect” on the LGBT community.      Dec 22, 2008 - 9:57 am            8.  Professor Guvinoff:      A classic case of projection.   Nobody can accuse someone else as being a bigot more forcefully than another bigot can.    Let’s not panic just because some high-speed rethorical projectiles are being thrown around in various directions.    There is room for reason, too.      Dec 22, 2008 - 11:05 am            9.  David Thomson:      I simply do not understand why gays should care about getting married.  First of all, few actually do.  And perhaps even fewer believe in monogamy.  It seems like the majority of these individuals advocate “open marriage.”  Marriage is, however, primarily about raising children.  Religious belief has little to do with anything.  A totally secular—and even atheistic argument can be made restricting marriage to heterosexual couples.  Gay sex, whether we like it or not, does not result in bringing children into the world.  The often ridiculed nuclear family is the best way to turn youths into productive citizens.      Dec 22, 2008 - 11:31 am            10.  Another View:      I vehemently oppose any stance that Gay rights and civil rights of citizens are on the same page.   With that said unless someone can show me data that humans are evolving to be Asexual. I will never support gay marriage. I will fight with gays if they were attacked. But I will not accept it as natural. Sure it has gone on throughout history. But same sex couples can’t have children. They may do as they please but don’t allow children think that lifestyle is progressive for humanity. Some homosexuality is learned behavior. I actually think they all “choose”. Take religion out of the equation and you still have a square peg and a round hole.   Sex feels good so we reproduce.      Dec 22, 2008 - 12:52 pm            11.  Paul_Unalaska:      Another View, rightly put.   I was happy to see the Prop 8 bill result as it had.  For if it’d gone the other way, our religous institutions would’ve been strong armed to recognize these individuals.  A domino effect, so to speak.      Dec 22, 2008 - 5:09 pm            12.  Paul_Unalaska:      Though I disagree in the ‘choice’ of sexuality comment.  More studies, strong evidence are suggesting otherwise.      Dec 22, 2008 - 5:11 pm            13.  KW64:      Politicians should not be required to choose between traditional Christians and Gays. That is not part of their public servant requirement. They serve both communities and should be able to interact with both communities.      Dec 22, 2008 - 9:23 pm            14.  Marauder:      Joe Solmonese thinks that Prop 8 is “the greatest loss our community has faced in 40 years”? Not a chance. The death of Harvey Milk was a much greater loss to the gay community than Prop 8, which will probably end up overturned within seven years max.   Another View: Realizing that they’re gay is often a scary and emotionally wrenching experience for teenagers. Why would they choose to be gay? If they could choose, why wouldn’t they just choose to be straight and spare themselves the anguish?      Dec 23, 2008 - 4:09 am            15.  Scott:      I’m another gay Republican who is not “outraged” by Rick Warren. The man supports civil unions, and that’s fine with me. Here in California, we already have domestic partnerships that are the same as “marriage” as far as the state is concerned. We have community property rights, inheritance, visitation, power of attorney, etc. “Marriage” would not have change this one whit.    I was amazed how many gay people I knew believed that if gay marriage happened in CA that it would automatically give gay couples federal marriage rights. They were unaware that our status would not have changed at all.    And a word to those above who insist we “choose” to be gay: Did you get up one morning and “decide” that you were heterosexual? Well, I didn’t get up one day and “decide” to be gay. It just IS.    Many of us are monogamous. I have been with my partner for just under 20 years.      Dec 23, 2008 - 8:51 am            16.   Forrest :      I think the negative reaction to this is just an illustration of the trend we’re currently on.  Instant information, and the desperate need for news organizations to attract viewers and readers means every negative voice can and will be heard.   Personally I don’t see why gay marriage is a bad thing.  In my mind, it’s an equal-but-separate kind of thing.  I thought we’ve already decided that wasn’t acceptable?  But to piss and moan about a selection of a specific pastor to perform the invocation at the inauguration…it’s not like Obama made him Assistant to the President for Gay and Lesbian Rights.   Obama has expressed his desire to bring the country together.  I think the selection is a sign he may actually mean it.      Dec 23, 2008 - 9:34 am            17.  Anonymous:      Some thoughts on your posts:   1.  “…not everyone in the gay community reacted poorly to the passing of Proposition 8.”  I don’t know “everyone,” but everyone that I know did in fact react poorly.  The issue with Prop 8 is that it forcibly took rights away from one group of people, a minority, that that minority already had, and indeed the people who put Prop 8 together and pushed it through are bigoted against gay people.  So let’s be clear:  An openminded person does not seek to take rights away from others, or seek to deprive others of rights that everyone else is entitled to.  Although, you may not call what happened bigotry, but let’s be honest that’s what it is.   2.  “…inviting Warren to give a prayer at the inauguration, thats an unspeakable outrage.”  Here’s why gays are upset:  Warren is anti-gay.  His own church website up until yesterday was laced with rhetoric about gays being sinners, and of course, Warren is on video saying just that among many other unsavory and downright nasty comments directed at gays.  Thus, the outrage.  There are many other ministers that Obama could have reached out to.  The one Obama chose happens to be anti-gay.  Please cut gay people some slack here.  If a minister were speaking who said horrible things about you and your family, you’d be upset about it.  It’s a human reaction.  Gays are human you know.  Made in God’s image, just like everyone else.   3.  “Although Warren isnt pro-gay marriage, he absolutely is no hate monger.”  Warren is in fact fomenting hate against gay people by seeking to deny them of their rights.  What would you call someone who forcibly goes out of their way to take your rights away from you?  Gays feel hated by him.  You likely would too if you were on the receiving end of his actions.   4.  “We know how it is. If you even talk to someone who who doesnt believe in their cause youre a knuckle dragging bigot.”  This sort of logic is used to make gays look unreasonable.  Gay people are not unreasonable.  Gay people are sick and tired of being picked on.  Gays are openminded people, and clearly allow for differing viewpoints.  Gays don’t look for tolerance, acceptance and anything of the kind.  What gays want is to be left alone to live our lives.  Just as you want to be left alone to live your lives.  Gays don’t want people telling us we’re not worthy of the same rights as everyone else.  You are entitled to your views, but isn’t it time to live and let live?  Really, this world has got bigger fish to fry.   5.  “…I long ago ceased thinking of LGBT people as a victim class. In general, they seem to be doing rather well for themselves - always have, in fact. Frankly, they appear to be one of the wealthiest, most influential minorities in the country. … But pardon me if I dont weep over its supposed ‘chilling effect’ on the LGBT community.”  All gays are rich?  That’s news to me.  This one isn’t.  I don’t know a single rich gay person.  I know gay people who go to work every day just like everybody else and have lousy jobs like everyone else and are underpaid and underappreciated at work just like everybody else.  The “chilling effect” on the gay community is that rights were taken away from us.  That out to send a chill down everyone’s spine, straight and gay.  You don’t want to live in a world where people who don’t like you will vote to take your rights away from you.  You think it will stop with the gays?  Think again.  Once you start stripping one minority of their rights, the rest will follow.  There’s are loads of people out there who hate Jews, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc.  Should these people be emboldened to start taking rights away since everyone turned a blind eye when it happened to the gays?  Think about it.  This is the proverbial slippery sloap.   6.  “I simply do not understand why gays should care about getting married.”  Lots of heterosexual people feel the same way about straights getting married.  Some people want to get married.  That’s the extent of it.  You don’t need to get it.  Because you “dont’ get” why gays want to marry is a reason to deny gays equal rights?  Really?   7.  “I vehemently oppose any stance that Gay rights and civil rights of citizens are on the same page.”  That’s how YOU feel.  Others feel diffferently.  The similarity is that rights are being denied.  “I actually think they all ‘choose.’”  Well, that’s simply not true.  But you’re welcome to believe what you want to believe.  But just because YOU believe this, is it a reason to deny gay people equal rights?  Why isn’t it enough for you to have your beliefs and allow others to have their beliefs?  Why must you take your beliefs to the next level of denying gay people equal rights?     8.  “…religous institutions wouldve been strong armed to recognize these individuals. A domino effect, so to speak.”  That’s also not true.  Religious institutions may do exactly what they want to do.  Religious institutions may slam their doors in the faces of gay people if that’s what the institution chooses to do.  Marriage is a “civil union.”  That means it’s a legal matter.  Churches have never been forced to marry anyone they don’t care to marry, including people who are not members of their churches.  This line of defense is 100% fabricated and it’s unfair and wrong to use it as your sole basis for debate on this issue.  Since what you’ve written is not true, there’s no reason to bring it up.   9.  “Politicians should not be required to choose between traditional Christians and Gays.”  True.  Who asked them to choose?  If you ask me, it has been the Christians who have been TELLING politicians they have to choose, not asking.  Again, all gays want is to be left alone to live our lives with 100% equality across the board.  When you get into telling people they are less than you, as the Christians have been doing with gays, then the group being attacked is going to react.  If you don’t like the reaction, quit attacking.  Live and let live.   10.  “Realizing that theyre gay is often a scary and emotionally wrenching experience for teenagers. Why would they choose to be gay? If they could choose, why wouldnt they just choose to be straight and spare themselves the anguish?”  Yes, it is human nature to want to be just like everyone else.  No one likes being different.  Even more so, no one likes being attacked for being different.  God made all of us, even the gays.     11.  “Im another gay Republican who is not outraged by Rick Warren. The man supports civil unions, and thats fine with me.”  Some gays do want to get married.  Should they be denied that desire just because you don’t believe in marriage for yourself?      To close, here’s an idea:  Why don’t we all just live and let live?  Why don’t we get out hearts and minds out of people’s personal lives and direct that energy toward rescuing our country?  Just a thought.      Dec 23, 2008 - 11:30 am            18.  Princess:      You libbbies are sooo sensitive.

Paul_Unalaska:      Anonymous, your calling the LGBT population a ‘minority’ is extremely insulting.  To categorize a sexual preference and combine it with a nationality is ignorant to the ..nth degree at best.   FYI, one of the reasons our country requires ‘rescuing’ is people have not looked at our country as a whole, but lived in a secular, gimme gimme type chasm for so long.  ‘What’s mine is mine’ approach.   Example: The Continental plane that veered off Colorado’s airport this past week-end.  The resulted injuries occurred AFTER the plane lurched off the tarmac and stopped within 600 ft of one of the airport’s fire stations.  Instead of helping their fellow man/woman and child, people were frantic, self centered and disgusting when exiting the damaged craft.  ‘To hell with the others’ was the apparent action.  Similiar to the Seinfeld episode where George was pushing women and children of a supposed kitchen fire.  Hence the broken bones, bruising, etc.,   Lastly, show me an event, workplace where there’s an, ‘Heterosexual Pride’ parade, a white only college, a special interest group that is for the advancement of ALL PEOPLE, an office that doesn’t use EEO as their hiring tablet but educated, intelligent and well spoken applicants need only apply. THAT’S A WORLD WHERE SEXUAL PREFERENCE, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, NATIONALITY, ETC., DON’T MATTER.  We, as homo sapiens get futher and further from that society each and everyday with your banter.      Dec 23, 2008 - 3:02 pm            20.  Paul_Unalaska:      Whats mine is mine   -Excuse me, I’d meant ‘What’s yours is mine’.  Sorry for the confusion.      Dec 23, 2008 - 5:46 pm            21.  Dave D:      anon, its not about living and let living. Its about glbt having the same moral legitimiacy as heterosexual marriage, and your entire post shows this is the reasoning. This means not so much legal change, but moral change..civil unions grant virtually all of the legal rights, but marriage grants moral legitimacy.   That’s why the huge firestorm of protest..obama’s selection of warren was a moral issue, not a legal one. he is not appointing warren to his cabinet, he is not doing anything except using him figuratively as an olive branch to evangelicals, mostly i wager to soften their worry that he would stomp all over them politically. But he violated the moral argument by having someone who doesn’t believe in the moral equivalency of all modes of sexual expression.   That desire is something that can never be satisfied in law, mostly because while a majority of people are okay with gayness and the need for legal equivalency, they can’t find it morally equivalent, for whatever reason.    I think that is what people find worrisome. Legal equality even christians accept, in terms of protections, custody, etc-that never was the dilemmna. What was was glbt often trying to use the courts and other means, like the schools, to try and force acceptance of moral equivalency. That isn’t live and let live.   Legal equivalency can be satisfied, but moral can’t.      Dec 23, 2008 - 8:00 pm            22.  Confused in Virginia:      I hope you will forgive my ignorance, but I have a couple of questions I hope you can answer.  First, why is it that anyone who does not approve of the gay lifestyle (although I know that it is not a choice), is called a homophobic.  That word suggests that people have an irrational fear of gays.  Maybe some people were brought up in the christian faith and they believe homosexuality is a sin.  I have heard the word tolerance thrown about, but this means that everyone should tolerate gays, although gays don’t seem to have an obligation to tolerate anyone who thinks that being gay is a sin.   Secondly, just about every gay person I know (my sister is gay, so I know a lot of her friends) wants to convert someone to their lifestyle.  I don’t understand why, but I’ve been told that the majority of the people are gay, but that they are just too afraid to try it.  Do you agree with that?   Thirdly, it seems that gay people want to announce their sexual preference to everyone.  I believe that straight, gay, or otherwise, a person’s preference should be a private matter.  I don’t go announcing to the world who I have sex with.   As for the Rev. Warren issue, I read something on another board, posted by a gay person who said, and I’m paraphrasing, that the gays got Obama elected and that he owes that community selecting an openly gay minister to give the invocation, and several cabinet positions should be filled by openly gay people.  I thought the whole idea of electing Obama was to change government, not to start having him answer to special interest groups.  Any thoughts?   I realize that this post might seem ignorant and anti-gay, but please don’t slam me.  I am trying to learn something from your answers, and I am not anti-gay in any sense of the word.  I thank you in advance for taking the time to read this and respond.      Dec 24, 2008 - 2:26 am            23.  Marauder:      Anonymous: Seeing as you stated it as a sweeping statement, I have to disagree that “Gays are openminded people, and clearly allow for differing viewpoints.” Of course there are a lot of openminded gay people who allow for differing viewpoints, but there are gay jerks and intolerant gay people the same way that there are jerks and intolerant people among every group.   Confused in Virginia:   “First, why is it that anyone who does not approve of the gay lifestyle (although I know that it is not a choice), is called a homophobic. That word suggests that people have an irrational fear of gays. Maybe some people were brought up in the christian faith and they believe homosexuality is a sin. I have heard the word tolerance thrown about, but this means that everyone should tolerate gays, although gays dont seem to have an obligation to tolerate anyone who thinks that being gay is a sin.”   I’ve always thought “homophobic” was kind of a dumb term. People can disapprove of something without being afraid of it, and personally, I wish we’d figure out some other word that means “disapproving of homosexuality” without projecting motives and fears onto it.   I knew a girl once who had a religious opposition to homosexuality but was a nice person who would never be mean to anyone. I figured as long as she wasn’t being mean to gay people, she could think what she wanted. Sometimes, however, people who have religious objections to homosexuality are so busy crusading against it that they forget to treat gay people with kindness and to remember that they’re people with feelings just like everyone else.   I’m curious - if you believe “the gay lifestyle” isn’t a choice, how can it be a sin, in your mind? Don’t you have to choose to sin?   “Secondly, just about every gay person I know (my sister is gay, so I know a lot of her friends) wants to convert someone to their lifestyle. I dont understand why, but Ive been told that the majority of the people are gay, but that they are just too afraid to try it. Do you agree with that?”   You may know a bunch of gay people, but, as you indicate, they’re all your sister’s friends. They’re not representative of gay people as a whole. I definitely don’t think the majority of people are gay and are just too afraid to try it.   The problem with determining views of a group based on all the people you know from that group is that they’re individual people, and individual people of one group don’t always represent every other individual in that group. Say, for example, you knew eight black people and they were all black supremicists who hated white people. Are there black supremicists who hate white people? Of course there are, but just because all the ones you know are that way doesn’t mean all the ones in the world are that way, or even a large percentage of all the ones in the world.   “Thirdly, it seems that gay people want to announce their sexual preference to everyone. I believe that straight, gay, or otherwise, a persons preference should be a private matter. I dont go announcing to the world who I have sex with.”   I don’t know if you’re male or female, but you’ve probably had a girlfriend or boyfriend at some point, right? And you probably did things like kiss them on the cheek when other people were around and introduce them as “this is my girlfriend/boyfriend so-and-so.” At the same time, I’m sure you didn’t regale everyone with tales of what you were or weren’t doing with them sexually.   Most gay people just want to be able to do the same thing - not have to hide how they feel about someone they’re dating or in love with. It would be kind of ridiculous if straight people all decided that they were never going to tell anyone about their spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends because “a persons preference should be a private matter,” and they were never going to publically show any affection for them, or even acknowledge that they had spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. Should they be telling everyone what they were doing in bed last night? No, that’s “too much information” regardless of whether someone’s gay or straight, though of course some gay and straight people do it anyway.   Obama shouldn’t have to meet some kind of quota for gay people; he should pick the people he thinks are best for the job and best for America, regardless of race or sexuality.   I really appreciate that you want to learn something, and I hope my answer helped.      Dec 24, 2008 - 4:29 am            24.  Anna Turtle:      This article really downplays Rick Warren’s homophobia. He is not some sensible guy who just happens to be against gay marriage. He equates gay relationships to incest and pedophilia. Gays are not welcome at his church. That goes a little further than a simple disagreement about whether gay marriage should be legalized or not.   Obama can do better for a speaker, and the Christian right can do better for a leader.      Dec 24, 2008 - 12:33 pm            25.  Confused in Virginia:      Marauder:  Thank you for your reply.  You are correct in that it seems like a contradiction to know that being gay is not a choice, while believing that it is a sin.  That is something that I wrestle with all the time.  I saw what my sister went through when she realized that she was gay.  I think the whole family knew, even though she denied it - even to herself.  I know that it is not an eazy life, especially when people are so quick to judge.  I accept her for who she is, and I’ve tried to change the way I see things, but my father was a minister, so we were taught from early on that this was a sin.  I may in time be able to change - I hope I can.   As for showing affection for my husband, I don’t believe in showing affection in public.  I think the only time we did that was on our wedding day, but you are correct that I introduce him as my husband.   I have always, and will always treat people with respect regardless of their race, religion, or sexual orientation.  I think that is something that is sorely lacking nowadays.   Maybe the best thing for me to do is talk with people like you, who can speak about the subject rationally, rather than just immediately judging me for my views instead of trying to educate me.  Thanks again for being so kind.      Dec 24, 2008 - 12:48 pm            26.  hp:      Opposing same-sex marriage does not make Warren  or anyone else  bigoted or hateful.   those who accept warren under those circumstances better sure as h. fire accept the same of anyone who voted against obama as being non-hateful and non-bigoted, too.   but they won’t.  THEIR  hate and bigotry is too far over the top to allow for open eyes and ears.      Dec 24, 2008 - 3:40 pm            27.  Kevin:      Number 23:   Sin is actually “missing the mark.”  Traditionally the Christian teaching has been all sex outside of a sanctified marriage is a sin. In this case, being attracted to members of the same sex may be genetic to some degree (and honestly I am not sure its proven but even so, being drunk is a sin even if you are genetically predisposed to alcoholism) but acting on that impulse is sinful. It isn’t a comfortable position in this society, but then again Christianity is not supposed to be of this world and lots of things are sinful that we accept today. One could say most 16-20 something Christians probably wish premarital sex wasn’t considered sinful. It is and say what you like about Warren et al but he is consistent.   That said, I find it interesting the supporters of gay marriage are often the same folks who think we need to understand the Islamic viewpoint with its intolerance of gays, support of slavery, and treatment of women but don’t even consider that the Christian one might need to be understood.      Dec 24, 2008 - 5:18 pm            28.   lorenzo :      It would be nice if the “marriage is always between a man and a woman” falsehood would not get trotted out again and again.

Any reading of history not tainted with Boswell-like rewriting showsthey were few, far-between, and very specifically limited to certain ritualistic practices.

Ann:      28Lorenzo: lots of cultures have not had same sex marriage.  Lots of cultures have had same sex relationships that were ignored or accepted.  Two quite different things.   What the same sex marriage proponents don’t seem to realize is that calling such an arrangement a marriage doesn’t make it one any more than me going into the garage makes me a car.  Sorry to go back to that old basic illustration, but when the language is SO being lost, the old basic illustrations are helpful.      Dec 26, 2008 - 5:43 am            32.  Daniel:      I don’t understand what the big brouhaha is about.    As a gayly married man in Massachusetts, I couldn’t care less if anyone opposes Gays marrying.    You think homomarriages make Jesus angry ? Fine. Then don’t have them in your church.    Look at the Catholics. They don’t think non-Catholics should be allowed to marry Catholics, so what do they do? Simple. They don’t marry non-Catholics in their churches. Do they go to the government saying “we have to ban non-Catholic marriage in the constitution. For the last 10,000 years, we’ve only had Catholics getting married. Human civilization has depended on it, and letting non-Catholics marry will destroy the planet” ? No.   In my Jewish congregation, we think same-sex marriage is wonderful. I was in a Jewish same-sex wedding not too long ago. Hundreds of relatives and a rabbi were there, many of whom had also had Jewish weddings. We all have legal marriage licenses, and we don’t understand why Goyim who don’t go to our shul should even care what our marriages are like. I’m sure it works the other way around — that the Catholics aren’t keeping themselves up all hours of the night worrying about who got hitched at Temple Sinai last weekend.   To each his own. That’s how we do it in America.   So, why should the government get involved in the first place? Why should a couple of people at Rick Warren’s TV church control the policy affecting everyone else’s congregation?    In Massachusetts, churches who don’t want to marry Gays don’t have to, but churches who do, can. Congregations and individuals have a choice. Free to marry or not marry. Easy.   I’m personally not bothered at all with what Rick Warren believes. He probably believes in the Easter Bunny and Mr. Hanky too, but he’s probably a nice guy for the most part. Maybe not the smartest man, certainly not the best-looking man, but probably a nice one.    Where he crosses the line is when he tries to use the government to enforce his personal religious beliefs. To me, the genius of this country, the reason why we have so many healthy religious communities in the first place, is because the government stays out of religion. If Rick Warren wants to legislate religion as he sees it, it’s a two-way street. Before long, the government will show up and start managing your Gospel. Is that what you want? Affirmative action eucharist?   Don’t say I didn’t warn you.      Dec 26, 2008 - 7:30 am            33.  Bryn:      All I can say is that these left wing so called gay advocacy groups do not represent me!  My life does not revolve around the over paid Chelsea and WeHo activists who are completely out of touch with mainstream gays and lesbians.  HRC, GL Task Force and the other out of touch gay organizations are running a scam on glbt’s around this country.  They claim to speak for all of us.  They want our money and support, but use that money to fund high priced dinners with left wing nut job actors tooting their horns.  When they get around to actual representing all glbt’s in this country then I will support them.  Until then stop whining about Warren.  I would much rather have him doing the prayer than Media Queens Jessie Jackson or Al Sharpton!     I have seen such disgusting HATE from gay groups lately against Christina and anyone who disagrees with them that it is appalling.  It’s no wonder mainstream society still is leery of gays, when we have morons in leadership positions spewing their own brand of hatred.     Proudly gay, proudly out, proudly married, proudly Christian in a leadership position!      Dec 26, 2008 - 5:51 pm            34.  JR:      As a non-practicing anything, I find it curious that there is a huge uproar about Warren but it was all apologetics, ‘aint no thing but a chicken wing’ when it came to Wright.     He’s giving an invocation, people, not part of Obama’s cabinet.  Hell, he’s not even his pastor.  One sermon and he’s outta there.  Big damn deal.  Think that he’s going to be preaching about homosexuality or anything sexaul at all?  Highly doubtful.  LMAO   As a real moderate, I find the concept of ‘tolerance’ extremely amusing when it comes to the left.  “We’ll tolerate anything alternative, but horrors!  we can’t tolerate anything boring and Christian”.   I’ll believe in left wing tolerance the day that Rick Warren gives his invocation and no one on the left goes ‘BOOGEYMAN’!     Not holding my breath.  In fact, I’m certaint that somewhere there will be idiots with signs, protesting this event.   I would offer up that we’re still at war in two countries and our economy is in the proverbial toilet.  Perhaps we’ve got bigger things to worry about then some guy’s 10 minute prayer…which, I predict, will be kind, hopeful and short.     Tempest in a teapot.

clueweb09-en0008-12-07808	"                        EXPOS THE HRISTIANMAFIA         Where Those Who Now Run the U.S. Government Came From and Where They Are Taking Us         By Wayne Madsen         Part I                       A                fter several months of in-depth research and, at first, seemingly unrelated conversations with former high-level intelligence officials, lawyers, politicians, religious figures, other investigative journalists, and researchers, I can now report on a criminal conspiracy so vast and monstrous it defies imagination. Using hristiangroups as tax-exempt and cleverly camouflaged covers, wealthy right-wing businessmen and lergyhave now assumed firm control over the biggest prize of all the government of the United States of America. First, some housekeeping is in order. My use of the term hristianis merely to clearly identify the criminal conspirators who have chosen to misuse their self-avowed devotion to Jesus Christ to advance a very un-Christian agenda. The term hristian Mafiais what several Washington politicians have termed the major conspirators and it is not intended to debase Christians or infer that they are criminals . I will also use the term Nazi  not for shock value but to properly tag the political affiliations of the early founders of the so-called hristianpower cult called the Fellowship. The most important element of this story is that a destructive religious movement has now achieved almost total control over the machinery of government of the United States its executive, its legislature, several state governments, and soon, the federal judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court.         The United States has experienced religious and cult hucksters throughout its history, from Cotton Mather and his Salem witch burners to Billy Sunday, Father Charles Coughlin, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite, and others. But none have ever achieved the kind of power now possessed by a powerful and secretive group of conservative politicians and wealthy businessmen in the United States and abroad who are known among their adherents and friends as The Fellowship or The Family. The Fellowship and its predecessor organizations have used Jesus in the same way that McDonald uses golden arches and Coca Cola uses its stylized script lettering. Jesus is a logo and a slogan for the Fellowship. Jesus is used to justify the Fellowship access to the highest levels of government and business in the same way Santa Claus entices children into department stores and malls during the Christmas shopping season.         When the Founders of our nation constitutionally separated Church and State, the idea of the Fellowship taking over the government would have been their worst nightmare. The Fellowship has been around under various names since 1935. Its stealth existence has been perpetuated by its organization into small cells, a pyramid organization of orrespondents,ssociates,riends,embers,and ore members, tax-exempt status for its foundations, and its protection by the highest echelons of the our own government and those abroad.          The Roots of the Fellowship         The roots of the Fellowship go back to the 1930s and a Norwegian immigrant and Methodist minister named Abraham Vereide. According to Fellowship archives maintained at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois, Vereide, who immigrated from Norway in 1905, began an outreach ministry in Seattle in April 1935. But his religious outreach involved nothing more than pushing for an anti-Communist, anti-union, anti-Socialist, and pro-Nazi German political agenda. A loose organization and secrecy were paramount for Vereide. Fellowship archives state that Vereide wanted his movement to /span> carry out its objective through personal, trusting, informal, unpublicized contact between people.Vereide establishment of his Prayer Breakfast Movement for anti-Socialist and anti-International Workers of the World (IWW or obblies Seattle businessmen in 1935 coincided with the establishment of another pro-Nazi German organization in the United States, the German-American Bund. Vereide saw his prayer movement replacing labor unions.          A student of the un-Christian German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Vereide thoughts about a unitary religion based on an unyielding subservience to a composite notion of esusput him into the same category as many of the German nationalist philosophers who were favored by Hitler and the Nazis.  Nietzsche wrote the following of Christianity: /span> When we hear the ancient bells growling on a Sunday morning we ask ourselves: Is it really possible! This, for a Jew, crucified two thousand years ago, who said he was God son? The proof of such a claim is lacking.o:p>         One philosophical fellow traveler of Vereide was the German Nazi philosopher Martin Heidegger, a colleague of Leo Strauss, the father of American neo-conservatism and the mentor of such present-day American neo-conservatives as Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. Strauss close association with Heidegger and the Nazi idea of telling the big lie in order to justify the end goals Machiavellianism on steroids -- did not help Strauss in Nazi Germany. Because he was Jewish, he was forced to emigrate to the United States, where he eventually began teaching neo-conservative political science at the University of Chicago. It is this confluence of right-wing philosophies that provides a political bridge between modern-day Christian Rightists (including so-called Christian Zionists) and the secular-oriented neo-conservatives who support a policy that sees a U.S.-Israeli alliance against Islam and European-oriented democratic socialism. For the dominion theologists, the United States is the new Israel, with a God-given mandate to establish dominion over the entire planet. Neither the secular neo-conservatives nor Christian fundamentalists seem to have a problem with the idea of American domination of the planet, as witnessed by the presence of representatives of both camps as supporters of the neo-conservative Project for a New American Century, the neo-conservative blueprint for America attack on Iraq and plans to attack, occupy, and dominate other countries that oppose U.S. designs.         What bound all so-called merica Firstmovements prior to World War II was their common hatred for labor unions, Communists and Socialists, Jews, and most definitely, the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Vereide Prayer Breakfast Movement, pro-Nazi German groups like the Bund, and a resurgent Ku Klux Klan had more than propaganda in common they had an interlocking leadership and a coordinated political agenda.         Not only was Vereide pro-Hitler, he was the only Norwegian of note, who was not officially a Nazi, who never condemned Norwegian Nazi leader Vidkun Quisling, a man whose name has become synonymous with traitor and who was executed in 1945. Vereide and Quisling were almost the same age, Vereide was born in 1886, Quisling in 1887. They both shared a link with the clergy, Vereide was a Methodist minister and Quisling was the son of a Lutheran minister. The Norwegian link to the Fellowship continues to this day but more on that later.         Another pro-Nazi Christian fundamentalist group that arose in the pre-Second World War years was the Moral Rearmament Movement. Its leader was Frank Buchman, a Lutheran minister from Philadelphia. Buchman was a pacifist, but not just any pacifist. He and his colleagues in the United States, Britain, Norway, and South Africa reasoned that war could be avoided if the world would just accept the rise of Hitler and National Socialism and concentrate on stamping out Communism and Socialism. Buchman coordinated his activities with Vereide and his Prayer Breakfast Movement, which, by 1940, had spread its anti-left manifesto and agenda throughout the Pacific Northwest.         Buchman was effusive in his praise for Hitler. He was quoted by William A. H. Birnie of the  New York World Telegram ,   thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front line of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism .a style='mso-footnote-id: ftn1' href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""> [1]  Buchman also secretly met with Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Gestapo and controller of the concentration camps. Buchman was at Himmler side at the 1935 Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg and again at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The predecessor of Buchman Moral Rearmament Group, the Oxford Group, included Moslems, Buddhists, and Hindus. Buchman and Hitler both saw the creation of a one-world religion based largely on Teutonic, Aryan, and other pagan traditions mixed with elements of Christianity. Buchman saw Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism as being compatible with his brand of Christianity. Hitler, too, had an affectation for Islam and Buddhism as witnessed by his support for the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the anti-British Muslim Brotherhood, and Tibetan Buddhists. [2]  But Buchman had no sympathy for the Jews who Hitler was persecuting. Buchman told Birnie, /span> Of course, I don condone everything the Nazis do. Anti-Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitler sees a Karl Marx in every Jew./span>         Such global ecumenicalism is a founding principle for today Fellowship. With total devotion to Jesus and not necessarily His principles at its core, the Fellowship continues to reach out to Moslems (including Saudi extreme Wahhabi sect members), Buddhists, and Hindus. Its purpose has little to do with religion but everything to do with political and economic influence peddling and the reconstruction of the world in preparation for a thousand year Christian global dominion. Post-millenialist Fellowship members believe that Jesus will not return until there is a 1000-year pure Christian government established on Earth. It is this mindset that has infused the foreign policy of George W. Bush and his administration. The desire for a thousand year political dominion of the world is not new. Hitler planned for a housand Year Reich over the planet. It is not a coincidence that Hitler desired and the so-called Christian dominionists/reconstructionists now contemplate a thousand year reign. The Christian dominionists are the political heirs of Hitler, the Norwegians Vereide and Quisling, Buchman, Opus Dei founder and fascist patron saint Josemaria Escriva and their political and religious cohorts .          The Unsuccessful Right-Wing Coup Against a Democratic President         Vereide and Buchman had important allies on Wall Street. According to Marine Corps General Smedley Butler, shortly after Franklin Roosevelt was elected President in 1932, he was approached by a group of wealthy Republican industrialists to lead an anti-Roosevelt Fascist coup against the government. As with today Fellowship, Vereide and Buchman were merely front men for anti-Socialist big businesses who hid behind the fade of a Christian evangelical movement. To them and their bankrollers, Roosevelt was some sort of anti-Christ who was going to go to bat for the workers, blacks, the poor and women while, at the same time, menacing the ultra-rich and the rising Nazi and Fascist specter in Europe. The coup was to be financed mostly by the J. P. Morgan and Du Pont financial empires. General Butler, who had no time for these industrialists since his military forays into Central America and the Caribbean as a foot soldier on behalf of wealthy capitalists, rejected their overture. Gerald MacGuire, a Wall Street bond salesman and former Commander of the Connecticut American Legion, was the chief recruiter for the coup plot. Butler informed Congress of the plans for the coup. However, Congress was owned by Wall Street and no charges were ever brought against the plotters. Butler was incensed and went public but he was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist. Not until 1967, when journalist John Spivak uncovered the secret Congressional report, was Butler version of the events validated. In the report of the  Special Committee to Investigate Nazi Propaganda Activities in the United States, Rep. Samuel Dickstein (D-NY) concluded that there was evidence of a coup plot by the right-wing against Roosevelt. However, much to Butler chagrin, no criminal action was taken against the plotters.          Butler said MacGuire plan was for Butler to force Roosevelt to declare he had become too sick from polio and create a powerful new Cabinet position, the Secretary of General Affairs, to run the government on his behalf. The New Deal, something the U.S. fascists and Nazis referred to as the ew Deal,would have be scrapped. The comparison between the Secretary of General Affairs and the present Secretary of Homeland Security is striking. If Roosevelt did not agree to the coup plottersdemand, a half million American Legion veterans would march on Washington to physically remove Roosevelt from office. But MacGuire decided that the perception management campaign would work and an armed force would not be required. He told Butler, /span> You know the American people will swallow that.  We have got the newspapers.  We will start a campaign that the President health is failing.  Everyone can tell that by looking at him, and the dumb American people will fall for it in a second Shortly after his testimony before the House investigation committee, MacGuire died of pneumonia at the age of 37.          The perception management concerning the attempted right-wing coup against FDR was a harbinger of more ruses that would come from the same right-wing elements: that the first Secretary of Defense James Forrestal was suffering from mental illness when he threw himself out of the sixteenth story of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1949, that John F. Kennedy was killed by a lone, pro-Communist assassin, and that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The coup plotters involved some of the biggest names in American business and politics, including Irenee Du Pont of the wealthy chemical company family and founder of the pro-Fascist American Liberty League; J. P. Morgan officers Grayson Murphy and John Davis; General Douglas MacArthur; southern segregationist Governor Eugene Talmadge of Georgia; and, in what represented a sea change for the extreme American right-wing, two influential Catholics, former Democratic presidential candidate Al Smith, who had become very anti-Roosevelt, and John Raskob, a senior Du Pont official and a high ranking member of the Catholic Knights of Malta. The concordat between right-wing Protestants and Catholics presaged a later alliance between The Fellowship and the proto-Fascist Opus Dei movement.         Buchman, who was also involved in the creating the psychologically abusive Alcoholics Anonymous (which enticed many converts from booze to esus, created an organization called First Century Christian Fellowship. In 1939, while preaching against life extravagances, Buchman set up his headquarters in New York posh Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Buchman also found common cause with right-wing racist groups. In addition to his anti-Semitism, Buchman had no time for the civil rights movement. Like Vereide, he rejected women suffrage and the labor union movement. When the United States entered the war in December 1941, many of Moral Rearmament leaders sought conscientious objector status in the draft as ay evangelists. As with today fundamentalist Christians, Buchman was rejected by his fellow evangelicals and mainstream religious leaders, including his old evangelical colleague Sam Shoemaker and Dr. Franklin Clark Fry, leader of the United Lutheran Church in America, who called Buchman connection with Lutheranism inimal.After Senator Harry S Truman received the 1944 nomination for Vice President, he also dropped his past tenuous connections to Buchman. Reinhold Niebuhr, the famous theologian, and George Orwell both labeled Buchman Oxford Group and his successor Moral Rearmament Movement as ascist .         The Wartime Nazi Invasion of Washington You Never Heard About         Meanwhile, Buchman co-ideologist Vereide made his first entr into the U.S. Congress. In 1942, he began to hold small and discreet prayer breakfasts for the U.S. House of Representatives. The next year, the Senate began holding prayer breakfast meetings. Vereide Prayer Breakfast Movement was formally incorporated as the National Committee for Christian Leadership (NCCL). Its headquarters were in Chicago. In 1944, while Vereide friends in Germany were being pummeled by the Allies, especially by the Soviet Red Army, NCCL changed its name to International Christian Leadership (ICL), an indication that Vereide saw an immediate need to extend his influence abroad in the wake of a certain Nazi defeat. Vereide also made plans to move his headquarters to Washington, DC. In 1944, his first ICL Fellowship House was established in a private home at 6523 Massachusetts Avenue. In 1945, Vereide held his first joint Senate-House prayer breakfast meeting. In 1945, Vereide quickly got together a group of powerful right-wingers for a prayer breakfast following the death of President Roosevelt, one of Vereide and Buchman most despised politicians. Roosevelt did not comport with a President who followed the dictates of od Will,a major Vereide and Buchman principle. At the breakfast were Senators H. Alexander Smith (R-NJ), Lister Hill (D-AL), and  World Report  publisher David Lawrence. Lawrence was an ardent foe of the New Deal.         After President Truman announced that he was going to continue FDR programs what he called the Fair Deal the religious right of Republicans and southern Democrats decided to attack Truman. His vulnerability to charges that Communists were embedded in his administration would give rise to the cancer of McCarthyism. However, for the religious right of Vereide, Buchman, and their political allies, this was a necessary and God-driven form of political and moral cleansing. The radical right would also force Truman to consolidate power in a new post-war intelligence agency that would replace the Office of Strategic Services the Central Intelligence Agency.         Senator Smith was a colleague of fellow Republican and anti-New Dealer Senator Prescott Bush from Connecticut (father of George H. W. Bush and grandfather of George W. Bush). According to Smith archived papers, he was also active with Buchman Oxford Group. Prior to the war, Alexander New Jersey was a hotbed of Nazi activity. The home of German admirer Charles Lindbergh (and the crime scene for a Nazi conspiracy to kidnap and murder his son) and the first port of call for the ill-fated Nazi airship, the  SS Hindenburg , New Jersey was friendly territory for groups like Moral Rearmament, the Bund, the Ku Klux Klan, and Vereide Prayer Breakfast Movement. One of Alexander predecessors as a New Jersey Senator, J.P. Morgan investment banker Hamilton Fish Kean, was also a strenuous opponent of the New Deal until he left the Senate in 1935. His grandson, Thomas H. Kean would serve as New Jersey governor and co-chair of the controversial 911 Commission.          It was odd that Lister Hill would have been associated with Vereide and Buchman. He had been a major supporter of the New Deal, which greatly benefited Alabama. However, Hill was also staunch opponent of Roosevelt other major initiative, civil rights. The evangelical Christian movement championed segregation. Vereide and Buchman could always be relied upon to come up with a Biblical reason for segregation and that was good for Hill political future.          The connection between Vereide and segregation was highlighted by his close relationship with a Senator who was not only a member of the Ku Klux Klan but was engineered into office by them. But, surprisingly, this Senator was not from Alabama or Mississippi but from Maine. Republican Ralph Owen Brewster was not only a member of Vereide ICL, an anti-New Dealer but also anti-Catholic. This was yet another irony of the pre-Fellowship. Religious contradictions among its members were not as important as the drive for political and financial power. The contradiction exists today with the Fellowship: Orthodox Jews, secular-oriented neo-conservative Jews, conservative Catholics, evangelical Protestants, and fundamentalist Sunni and Wahhabi Moslems all cooperate to further an agenda that uses Jesus as a de facto corporate logo.         Brewster was the consummate eligiouspolitician-businessman of his time. He was the person who personally introduced Vereide to many of his colleagues, including Senator Harold Hitz Burton (R-Ohio), a future Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.         Played by actor Alan Alda in the movie about Howard Hughes,  The Aviator , Brewster engaged in a backroom illegal deal on behalf of Pan American Chairman Juan Trippe to force Hughes to sell Trans World Airlines to Pan Am in return for Brewster dropping a congressional investigation against Hughes for alleged war profiteering. One of Pan Am directors at the time of the feud between Hughes and the team of Brewster and Trippe was Prescott Bush. The grandfather of George W. Bush had seen the assets of Union Banking Corporation, on whose board he served, seized after the beginning of the Second World War by U.S. Treasury agents. It turned out that Bush bank was operated by Bush and his boss Averell Harriman on behalf of Nazi Germany. Prescott father-in-law, George Herbert ertWalker, also represented Nazi German interests through his Brown Brothers, Harriman investment company and affiliated firms with names like American Shipping & Commerce, Harriman Fifteen Corporation, Holland Amercian Trading Corporation, Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation, Silesian-American Corporation, and Hamburg-Amerika Line that were tangled together in a circuitous spider web. This would be a blueprint for future Bush family/right-wing oil and intelligence enterprises involving election fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and political assassinations.         Perhaps because of his first name and his ties to Florida and Latin America, Juan Trippe was often thought of as a Cuban. However, he was of English ancestry and was born in Sea Bright, New Jersey.          Like Pan Am director Prescott Bush, Trippe close friend and business partner Charles Lindbergh also had a run in with the U.S. government. After being awarded the Service Cross of the German Eagle medal by Hermann Goering, Lindbergh, an ex-Army Air Force colonel, was not permitted to have his commission as an officer restored under direct orders from Roosevelt himself. Roosevelt always believed that Lindbergh was a Nazi. Lindbergh became an advocate for the United States avoiding war with Germany through his activity with the America First Committee yet another group sprung from the pro-Nazi right-wing in America. According to Lindbergh biographer Laura Muha, Lindbergh said that he was suspicious of American Jews because of heir large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our Government.It was a claim that many years later would be repeated by the guardian angel of the Fellowship, Reverend Billy Graham.         Meanwhile, Howard Hughes spent much of his own capital on prototype aircraft for the U.S. Army Air Corps. Hughes hired his own gumshoes to spy on Brewster and Trippe and dig up dirt on them. Their connections to Vereide and his pro-Nazi religious friends was likely their biggest atchand something the secular right-wing Hughes would later use as political capital. When the right-wing religious Republicans mounted a challenge against Richard Nixon at the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami using Ronald Reagan as their standard bearer, Hughesmoney and influence would ensure Nixon nomination and the religious right defeat. The Fellowship would have its revenge against Nixon and his backers in the late summer of 1974.         Onward Christian Soldiers!         After the war, Vereide moved to consolidate right-wing groups in Europe. His hated Communists and Socialists had taken over governments across Eastern Europe and were on the verge of achieving power in Western Europe. Winston Churchill had been swept from power by a very leftist-oriented Labor government headed by Clement Atlee. For the remnants of the Nazi movement in America, an OSwas being transmitted from Europe for assistance. Vereide traveled to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, France and Germany. His ICL made an alliance with the like-minded British Victory Fellowship in Great Britain. He also struck up a close relationship with German Lutheran pastor Gustav Adolf Gedat. The German clergyman had been a leading anti-Semite before and during the war. During the same year that Vereide began his prayer breakfasts in Seattle, from the pulpit Gedat thundered that, od ordered the Germans to hunt down Jews.Gedat became an apologist for top Nazi officials. He was an activist against tracking down Nazi war criminals, such as former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, a personal friend of the current Republican Governor of California and fellow Austrian, Arnold Schwarzenegger. It should be noted that Schwarzenegger father, Gustav Schwarzenegger was a volunteer in the Nazi  Sturmabteilung  (SA), also known as the Brown Shirts, in Austria and served in the German Army.          As a member of the West German Bundestag, Gedat brought about the cancellation at the Cannes Film Festival of the showing of a movie about a family of Jewish refugees from Prague during the Nazi regime. At the same time, Gedat was one of three of Vereide International Council for Christian Leadership (ICCL) representatives in Europe. The other two were also Nazis, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands (married to Queen Juliana) and German Prince Max von Hohenlohe. The latter served under SS head Walter Schellenberg and, according to SS documents captured by the Soviets, Hohenlohe engaged in direct negotiations during the war with Allen Dulles of the OSS. Like Vereide and Buchman, Dulles was a strong anti-Semite who saw Communism and Jews through the same lens. Through the OSS and CIA at Lineprogram, such infamous Nazis as Klaus Barbie (the utcher of Lyon, Nazi ad scientistand butcher Dr. Joseph Mengele, concentration camp vaccine esterKurt Blome, and SS Commander Adolf Eichmann, escaped from Europe to South America with the assistance of Opus Dei collaborators in the Vatican.         In January 1947, Vereide sponsored the first Washington meeting of ICCL. representatives from the United States, Canada, Britain, Norway, Hungary, Egypt and China. In 1949, Vereide sent Wallace Haines to represent ICL at a meeting of German Christians held at Castle Mainau in Switzerland. Haines would become Vereide personal emissary to Europe. Haines was replaced in 1952 by the virulent anti-Communist Karl Leyasmeyer. In 1953, Vereide made his first entr into the White House when President Dwight Eisenhower agreed to attend the first Presidential Prayer Breakfast. By that time, Vereide congressional core members grew to include such senators as Republicans Frank Carlson of Kansas and Karl Mundt of South Dakota. Both were virulent anti-Communists who established close ties with Vereide and his worldwide anti-Communist movement. Vereide also became very close to one of the Senate most ardent segregationists, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the man who led the Dixiecrat revolt against the Democratic Party in 1948. Thurmond would be a key part of the strategy of Vereide to evangelize poor whites in the South. For Vereide, it would bring converts to his peculiar brand of Christianity; for Thurmond, it would bring into the Republican Party former New Deal Democrats who saw their party straying from segregation and embracing civil rights. For the United States, the strategy would bring a radical form of fundamental zealotry closer to taking control of the country.         Buchman, clearly wishing to obfuscate about his pro-Nazi ties before the war, turned his attention towards Asia, particularly Korea. One Korean Presbyterian preacher, who took an interest in Buchman Moral Rearmament principles of a universal religion and total personal submission, was Yong Myung Mun of North Korea. He later changed his name to Sun Myung Moon and, after being expelled from the Presbyterian Church for preaching heresy, he established a right-wing, nominally Christian sect called the Unification Church. Like Vereide and Buchman, Moon began to spread his influence globally.         By 1957, ICL had established 125 groups in 100 cities, with 16 groups in Washington, DC alone. Around the world, it had set up another 125 groups in Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Northern Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Ethiopia (where Emperor Haile Selassie gave ICL property in Addis Ababa to build its African headquarters), India, South Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Guatemala, Cuba, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Bermuda. ICL international activities coincided with activities in countries where the CIA was particularly active an obvious by-product of the close cooperation between Vereide and the CIA Allen Dulles and James Jesus Angleton. Angleton and his close associate, Miles Copeland, favored using private businessmen to conduct operations that the CIA was barred from conducting statutorily. The ICL fit the bill very nicely. And although the Fellowship despised homosexuals, that did not stop FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was strongly rumored to have been gay, writing a prayer for Vereide.         With the end of colonial rule in large parts of Africa and Asia, Vereide and his new disciple, an Oregonian Christian youth worker named Douglas Coe, set out to make contacts in a number of the newly-independent nations. Coe soon became Vereide heir apparent. ICL also established an Asian headquarters in Hong Kong.         Graham Crackers and Moon Rise          In 1958, Representative Albert H. Quie (R-MN) became an important core member of Vereide group. The Presidential Prayer Breakfast became an annual Washington institution. Since Billy Graham became a regular fixture at the misnamed residentialprayer breakfast, many attendees figured that the event was officially sponsored by the White House. They were wrong, very wrong. Had they understood the Nazi and Fascist pasts of Vereide and his associates, it is doubtful that the annual prayer breakfast would have taken on such trappings of a state function. Early attention to the group may have prevented them from gaining a toehold in the White House and Congress.         One of Buchman followers in the military was General Edwin A. Walker, fired by President John F. Kennedy for insubordination. It was later alleged that Lee Harvey Oswald had attempted to assassinate Walker, a laughable charge considering the right-wing affiliations of both.         As the world reeled in horror at the shooting death of President Kennedy in Dallas in November 1963, the ICL moved into a new Fellowship House at 2817 Woodland Drive in northwest Washington, DC near the Shoreham Hotel. Later it would move to 1904 North Adams Street in Arlington, Virginia, just a few blocks from 2507 North Franklin Road where another virulent right-winger and anti-Semite named George Lincoln Rockwell had set up his own national headquarters. From another one of his Arlington headquarters, nicknamed Hatemongers Hill, Rockwell flew the Nazi flag, blared the Nazi Horst Wessel anthem into the street and menaced trespassers with two vicious dogs one named Gas Chamber, the other dubbed Auschwitz. Rockwell, a retired U.S. Navy Commander, was the Fuehrer of the American Nazi Party. Rockwell and Vereide shared something in common other than the same neighborhood: absolute hatred for Jews and homosexuals.          In 1965, an aging Vereide resigned as director of ICL and was succeeded as acting director by Richard Halverson, a Presbyterian minister who later became the Chaplain of the U.S. Senate. Vereide continued as Director of Fellowship House. According to Jeff Sharlet of the Center for Religion and Media at New York University and the author of a 2003  Harper  article on the Fellowship, Vereide often exhorted his followers to emulate the cadres of Hitler or Mao Tse-tung in spreading their form of militant Christianity.          In 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated after he won California Democratic primary by Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian igrto America. Kennedy was succeeded in the Senate by Charles E. Goodell, appointed by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Goodell was also a core member of the Fellowship.         On January 30, 1969, Vereide, Billy Graham, and newly-inaugurated President Richard Nixon gathered for the Presidential Prayer Breakfast. There is little doubt that Nixon had been tipped off years before by his friend and bankroller Howard Hughes about Vereide ties to Pan Am Trippe and his bought-and-paid for senator, Brewster. Nevertheless, Nixon, a Quaker, became close to Billy Graham, the North Carolina-born evangelist and one-time student at Bob Jones University who is also the Fellowship patron saint. Obviously, Nixon shared the Fellowship and Graham anti-Semitism.          The Nixon tapes reveal that in 1972, Nixon, Graham, and H.R. Haldeman had a conversation in the Oval Office in which the Jews were targets:         Graham: his [Jewish] stranglehold has got to be broken or the country going down the drain.o:p>    Nixon: ou believe that?o:p>    Graham: es, sir.o:p>    Nixon: h, boy.So do I. I can ever say that but I believe it.o:p>    Graham: o, but if you get elected a second time, then we might be able to do something.o:p>    ---    Graham:  y the way, Hedley Donovan has invited me to have lunch with [the Time Magazine] editors./span>    Haldeman:  ou better take your Jewish beanie.o:p>    Graham: s that right? I don know any of them now . . . A lot of Jews are great friends of mine . . .They swarm around me and are friendly with me because they know that I friendly with Israel. But they don know how I really feel about what they are doing to this country.o:p>    Nixon: /span> You must not let them know.o:p>         The tapes reveal the inconsistencies of the Fellowship. On one hand, their Nazi and Fascist past and tendencies make it seem unlikely that they would be supportive of Israel. Yet, support for Israel is not only something advocated by Graham but also by the shock troops for today fundamentalist movement, the so-called hristian Zionistwing of the Fellowship.          Although Nixon would later come to distrust the Fellowship, one of his closest confidants, Charles Colson, would become one of the key figures in the group. Colson served time in jail as a result of his involvement in the Watergate scandal. He would later re-emerge orn againand serve as a covert adviser to the very same elements who would propel George W. Bush into office as President. No longer would the Fellowship have a paranoid, moderate Republican like Nixon or corny, superficially Christians like Reagan or George H. W. Bush in the White House. For the Fellowship, Nixon, Reagan and the first Bush served their purposes but they were not true believers. In their minds, after an unsuccessful coup against Roosevelt and war with their brethren in Germany; the uncooperative and eft leaningadministrations of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson; a paranoid administration in Nixon; a transitional Gerald Ford; a born again Christian anomaly in Jimmy Carter; partial entrees to power with Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush; and absolute disgust with Bill Clinton, the Fellowship believed it was God will that they would have one of their very own core members wielding power in the Oval Office and carrying out God (the Fellowship) dictates. In George W. Bush, who had been indoctrinated into the total submission to Jesus (the Fellowship) after his involvement with alcohol and drugs, fundamentalists would not only be able to remake the United States but, indeed, the entire world.         Additional tapes indicate that the Internal Revenue Service had Graham under investigation in September 1971. Since Graham was so close to the various Fellowship front activities and foundations, it is likely that the IRS was looking at the illegal mixing of tax-exempt religious groups with political campaigns. When Graham informed Nixon of the IRS probe, Nixon was not happy as the tapes indicate:         Nixon [to Haldeman]: /span> Please get me the names of the Jews, you know, the big Jewish contributors of the Democrats ... Could we please investigate some of the cocksuckers?...Here IRS is going after Billy Graham tooth and nail. Are they going after Eugene Carson Blake [president of the liberal National Council of Churches]?/span>         Unlike Graham, the Fellowship would not have any problem with its taxes. A letter from the Department of Finance and Revenue of the District of Columbia to Douglas E. Coe of International Christian Leadership, Inc., dated October 21, 1971, granted the group tax- exempt status on its property located at 2817 Woodland Dr., N.W. Washington, DC. In his request for tax-exempt status, Coe listed some of the activities that took place at Fellowship House. They included a Tuesday morning bi-monthly prayer meeting for Foreign Service wives; a Thursday morning attie Vereide Bible Study(Mattie was Abraham wife); raining and orientation activities,including egular sessions with associates from around the world;ow to run small groups;ow to set up prayer breakfasts;egular dinners involving the leadership of the world;and eetings to which students, blacks and other groups are invited by business and government leaders to discuss the importance of a strong spiritual foundation in our country.The last activity would prove fruitful for grooming future young African-American and other political activists who would oversee the Fellowship ultimate seizure of political power in America. The Fellowship was camouflaging its Nazi roots and accepting into its fold those minorities it considered useful for its political goals.          Billy Graham also supported the war in Vietnam. On April 15, 1969, just a few months after the National Prayer Breakfast, Graham sent a secret letter to Nixon from Bangkok, where the evangelical preacher was meeting Fellowship missionaries from South Vietnam. Graham and the missionaries urged Nixon to step up the bombing of North Vietnam and include in the campaign the bombing of dikes to vernight destroy the economy of North Vietnam.o:p>         In 1969, Vereide died and was succeeded by Coe. It is amazing how this right-wing Nazi sympathizer has been eulogized by Fellowship adherents. Norman Grubb biography of Vereide, titled  Modern Viking The Story of Abraham Vereide, Pioneer in Christian Leadership,  offers the following description of Vereide biography:         his is the story of a Norwegian immigrant to the United States who was the founder of International Christian Leadership, the legal name of what is popularly called The Fellowship, the origin of the Prayer Breakfast movement. While pastoring in Seattle, he also founded the first Good Will Industry. Vereide was a single-minded pre-World War II pioneer. The book is a narrative of meetings, people and letters as Vereide befriended government and business leaders in the name of Christ. He was a world-class leader whose legacy is thriving today on every continent.o:p>         Buchman died in 1961 and his Moral Rearmament Movement in the United States soon gave way to the Unification Church of Moon. Moon began to penetrate the United States with his issionariesin the 1960s. In 1972, Moon made his first journey to the United States. His number one priority was to take over control of the U.S. government by getting his followers elected to office. Moon traveled the country in what he called his International One World Crusade. As with Buchman, Moon kept his initial meetings small house parties were used to entice converts and like Vereide and Coe, groups were organized into small ells. And as with Vereide prayer breakfasts and Buchman rusades,hundreds of politicians around the country were duped into extending official welcomes to the enigmatic Korean.         In August 1974, as Richard Nixon administration was coming to an end after the constitutional crisis caused by the Watergate scandal, Moon dispatched his minions to the steps of the U.S. Capitol in defense of Nixon as the House was voting to impeach the president. Moon defenders of Nixon were joined on the Capitol steps by members of Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Baruch Korff  National Citizen Committee for Fairness to the Presidency. Korff had been a strong Zionist supporter of Israel. Meanwhile, according to Ohio Republican Party sources, a wealthy Christian fundamentalist from Cleveland had an important meeting with Nixon in the White House.          Fred Lennon was a kingpin in Ohio conservative politics. The owner of Crawford Fitting Company, Lennon built a fortune in manufacturing valves and fittings for the oil and aerospace and chemical industries. Du Pont was one of his biggest customers. Lennon became the majority owner in Swagelok Companies, the parent of Crawford Fittings and held half the shares in Lubrizol, the largest oil additive company in America before it was bought by General Motors. A right-wing Catholic, Lennon, like Vereide and Coe, adopted a simple motto for his business: ecrecy is Success. Success is Secrecy.Lennon, who insisted that his employees avoid beards and wear conservative suits with white shirts and ties, was a major financial contributor to conservative Christian Republicans, including Ronald Reagan and the late Republican Representative John Ashbrook of Ohio. Lennon criticized Ohio Republican Representative Steve LaTourette for wearing a beard even though the congressmen had received campaign contributions from the billionaire.         Lennon later established the Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs to advance the cause of raditional conservative values.Women rights foe Phyllis Schlafly and neo-conservative pamphleteer and pundit William Kristol later sat on the Ashbrook Center board. Ashbrook big claim to fame was that he opposed Nixon because he, like Lennon, thought the president was too liberal.         Lennon even pressured his various industrial suppliers to ante up for the Republican cause. Lennon was not the only Republican right-wing Mr. Money Bags in Ohio. Raymond Q. Armington, the wealthy Cleveland-based founder of Armington Engineering Company, which later merged with Euclid Road Machinery Company, also donated generously to right-wing causes. Armington later ended up on the board of General Motors. Armington was fond of introducing up and coming conservative politicians like Dan Quayle to nfluential people.Armington bequeathed a large portion of his estate to California Pepperdine University, a breeding ground for future right-wing Republican politicians. Pepperdine would eventually name President Clinton chief inquisitor and tormentor Kenneth Starr as Dean of its hristianlaw school. The influence of wealthy Ohio conservative Christian businessmen like Lennon, Armington, and Cincinnati Carl Lindner of United Fruit (later Chiquita Foods) would have far reaching effects. Ohio would become a haven for the activities of the Fellowship and their affiliated organizations and churches. In 2004, the inculcation of these forces in Ohio politics would have drastic and far-reaching effects for the United States and the world.         It was the ecrecy is successphilosophy that prompted Lennon to pay a visit to the beleaguered Nixon in August 1972. When Lennon said he had an offer to make Nixon, the president pulled him into a closet off the Oval Office. Lennon asked Nixon how much money it would take to salvage Nixon presidency from the Watergate crisis. Nixon replied that it was all over. And, for Nixon, as far as the Christian right was concerned, over it was.         The word went out to Christian right-wing circles and people who never really trusted Nixon that he was history. Shortly thereafter, two members of the Fellowship, Representatives Quie and John J. Rhodes (R-Arizona) met with Vice President Gerald Ford at a special rayer meetingon Capitol Hill. The date was August 8, 1974, the day before Ford was sworn in as President. On August 7, Rhodes accompanied two other Republican congressional leaders to the White House to tell Nixon it was over. The powerful Fellowship lurked behind the political maneuverings that led Nixon to decide to quit. After Nixon resigned, some Fellowship members, including Colson, made attempts to try to get Nixon to join their group as a way to salvage his legacy. Nixon would have nothing to do with them .         The Born-Again Nativity of George W. Bush         Yet another influence convinced Nixon that for the good of the Republican Party he should resign. He was the individual Nixon named as chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973. His name was George H. W. Bush, the man whose grandfather and father had championed the very same interests who were behind the pseudo-Christian Fellowship and Moral Rearmament the Nazis and Fascists.         Bush had reason to be thankful to the Christian fundamentalists. They helped his son, George W. Bush, avoid a certain court martial and prison time. On or about April 18, 1972, the Houston Police arrested First Lieutenant George W. Bush of the Texas Air National Guard for possession of cocaine. Bush and a friend were booked into the Harris County jail. Bush father, who was serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, hurriedly flew to Houston from New York and began to make the required phone calls to keep his son from receiving a court martial, dishonorable discharge, and a prison sentence. As one senior Bush business partner recalled, then-Ambassador Bush knew that junior was in eep shit.Senior Bush arranged for his son to serve at a religious drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in San Diego between May and November 1972. Conservative San Diego was a major center for Fellowship activities.    "

From Michelle  Goldberg's article :      [The] affair between fundamentalism and homophobia has been a long and faithful one. Whats new and chilling, however, is the single-minded ideological obsession of it. This is not something one sees in every theocratic state..... [T]he rhetoric of Irans fundamentalist clerics doesnt treat homosexuality as a cosmically subversive threat; instead, Jews and Zionism play that role (as they so often did in Europe before the Holocaust), a dynamic that may prove useful in deciphering the ubiquity and vehemence of anti-gay rhetoric among conservative Christians the world over.   Goldberg looks for explanations and sees at least two causes:     the globalization of the religious right a phenomenon that [Rick] Warrenwith all his overseas contactsexemplifies as well as anyone. Its also a result of the globalization of civil rights rhetoric. [Recently,] for example, sixty-six United Nations member states signed a declaration calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality worldwide. (The United States, predictably, was the one major Western nation that refused to sign).   Fundamentalists the world over spread myths about gay people, sexual and reproductive health, and science, they do so hoping to leverage the fear they create into power and access for fundamentalist leaders and cultural influence for fundamentalism as a movement.

Clarkson notes that:     Rick Warren has not (sic) inherent right to speak at the inaugural and Obama and his team are under no inherent obligation to pick him, or to have anyone do an invocation at all. ..... Honoring Warren with his prominent position at the inaugural goes to the substance of Obama and other [Democrats' involvement] with the man and with his international empire. Its the prominent tip of an important iceberg. This has been a matter of some considerable political debate over the past few years, and may very well have a lot to do with policy in the near future. ..... I believe that Obama et al are making a serious error in their alliance with Rick Warren. The justifications given do not hold water.... [F]or years [Obama has] been cultivating this powerful, Austrian school-informed builder of an international religious empire; who has big sway with governments in Africa and Asia. Some of those same governements are into the brutal represssion and perseuction of gay people. What kind of programs do you suppose Rick Warren, who some people say is ""great"" on combatting HIV/AIDS, can help develop when he is all about driving gay people underground in Africa? Economics? Health care? Civil Rights?   On January 20,  turn your back on Rick Warren's extremism . And  tell the President-elect  that such extremism is not ""change we can believe in;"" it is instead, unfortunately, less like change and more like what we've had for the last eight years.

Because of the passage of Proposition 8--which candidate Obama did but little to resist and belatedly--November 4, 2009 was bittersweet for literally 10,000s of LGBT Obamaniacs who'd given countless hours and dollars to Obama 2008.   ""Well,"" many LGBT supporters of Obama said to each other with a tired grin at election-watching parties that night, ""at least there is the inauguration to look forward to!""    Now the President-elect has again pulled a  Donnie McClurkin and Mary Mary moment . There will be not one out gay person on stage at the inauguration. But, there will be Rick Warren, an anti-science, anti-gay leader of the religious right who  describes himself as no different than James Dobson except in tone .    This situation reminds me of the occasional production of  Aida  at the Met when the elephant is brought out during the otherwise stirring ""Triumphal March,"" and then proceeds, under that hallowed proscenium, to take a giant shit on the stage.   Here are two things you can do to protest the Warren:    1. Each of us can contribute to the Repeal Prop 8 campaign.  Click here.     2. And on January 20th, Turn Your Back On Rick.    My friends Bob Zuckerman and Connie Ress have created a group on Facebook,  Turn Your Back On Rick . From the Facebook page:     [On January 20,] YOUR BACK ON RICK [WARREN] as he begins to speak on the stage. ..... [W]hether you are several blocks away from the Capitol watching on a jumbotron, or 2,000 miles away in your home, TURN YOUR BACK ON RICK....   Rick Warren 's opinions and place on the inaugural stage is no more a demonstration of ""diversity of opinion"" (the President-elect's justification) than is allowing Creationism into the halls of science education; it is not the inclusion of diversity, it is, quite simply, retrogression. Rick Jacobs of  Campaign Courage  said it well:      When Pastor Rick Warren was asked to clarify this statement -- if he actually equates same-sex marriage with incest, pedophilia and polygamy -- his answer was direct and unequivocal: ""Oh, I do."" That didn't stop President-elect Barack Obama from choosing Pastor Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration -- an appalling mistake that will forever tarnish our country's celebration of Obama's historic ascendance to the White House.   Sadly, it must be noted: Barack Obama continues to lack a record of ""fierce"" support for civil rights for gay Americans--""fierce"" being the characterization that the President-elect made  of himself  because no convincing witness can be found to offer such a characterization on his behalf. A fierce record looks very different than does Obama's. It includes things at even the most basic level as interviews with local gay media, something candidate Obama assiduously avoided doing despite being urged to repeatedly at donor events across the nation.   LGBT supporters of Obama are told time and again that Obama's  intentions  are  clearly  progressive when in comes to civil rights for gay Americans.   For many gay Americans and their straight allies, being told this time and again has become an insulting sop and pathetic substitute to proper action from the President-elect.

Rick Warren to offer the prayer at the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2009.

High courts in New York, Washington, and New Jersey have refused to extend marriage rights to gay couples. Only Massachusetts' top court has ruled in favor of permitting same-sex couples to enter into marriage contracts.   President-elect Barack Obama also opposes gay marriage and has no openly gay people on the program for his inauguration, despite tapping Rick Warren of Saddleback chruch, who is a fierce opponent of gay civil rights, rejects proper science education, and defends America's use of torture, to offer the prayer at the inauguration.

And Obama's ready to give it?                    President-elect Barack Obama has tapped Rick Warren to say the prayer at the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2009. Warren is a leader of the religious right. He is: anti-gay, anti-science (believes in ""Creationism""), opposed to reproductive freedoms, a biblical literalist, someone desiring political power and influence.    At the same time, Warren has been assiduously cultivating a public image as the warm-hearted nice guy ready to be ""America's Pastor."" As Frederick Clarkson reminded us, Warren's PR campaign is aided by center-left organizations  such as Faith In Public Life (FIPL) .    And now Obama's played into Warren's hand and at the same time has ably reminded his quick-to-forgive supporters of his easy decision last year to let  Donnie McClurkin spout his anti-gay superstitions on stage at an Obama 2008 fund-raiser .   More skeptical supporters of Obama are wondering why it seems that when you give Barack Obama a stage, he likes to put divisive homophobes on it.   Michelle Goldberg  puts the Warren decision in proper context :     [Rick] Warren compares abortion to the Holocaust, gay marriage to pedophilia and incest, and social gospel Christians as closet Marxists. He doesnt believe in evolution. He has won plaudits from some journalists for his honesty in forthrightly admitting that he believes that Jews are going to hell, but even if one sees such candor is a virtue, the underlying conviction hardly qualifies him as an ecumenical peacemaker. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, Warren himself described his differences with Dobson as mainly a matter of tone, and was unable to come up with a theological issue on which they disagree.   If Democrats collaborate in positioning Warren as the centrist alternative to the religious right, they consign vast numbers of people, including many of the partys most dedicated supporters, to the fringe. It does strengthen Warren as kind of a new Billy Graham figure, says the Reverend Dan Schultz, a United Church of Christ pastor and the founder of the progressive religious blog Street Prophets. That has especial relevance for Warrens role in Africa, where a very conservative kind of evangelical Christianity is exploding, bringing with it virulently anti-gay politics. What I have heard is that it will help Warren overseas, Schultz says of Warrens role in the inauguration. Hes big into work in Africa. This will give him a lot of clout over there. Part of the reason this is kind of insulting for me is that Warren has supported some pretty awful people in Africa, including people who think homosexuals should be jailed.   Take action.  Here's how to let President-elect Obama and others know that you oppose Warren delivering the prayer at the inauguration .

The ad, funded by the Becket Fund, is homophobic and a classic example of the culture of manufactured outrage and the tactic of ""blame the victim"" that are hallmarks of America's religious and cultural right wing.   Via HRC's action center, you can  write a letter to  The New York Times  and the Becket Fund . Provided are several  statements of reaction by progressive religious leaders . These statements can provide inspiration or ideas for your letter's content.   John Selders of Amistad United Church of Christ in Hartford, Connecticut put it aptly:      As an African-American, I've heard this before. A few frustrated members of a minority group respond in anger to a new indignity and the oppressor calls them anarchists. Satan, sometimes called the Father of Lies, is at work when powerful people seek to dehumanize those who are less powerful.   Rev. Dr. Ken Stone of Chicago Theological Seminary rightly asked, ""Where will the Becket Fund be when we call for endorsements of hate crimes and employment protection legislation for LGBT people?""   The Rev. Rebecca Voelkel, program director for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's Institute for Welcoming Resources, and who was an acquaintance of mine when we were at Yale together, issued this statement:      As a Christian, I was taught not to 'bear false witness.' One of the deepest tragedies of the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign in California was its bearing false witness-- more plainly stated, its lies-- about the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. This ad is one more example. In response to the passage of Proposition 8, faithful, honorable, patriotic Americans from every walk of life and of many sexual orientations and gender identities gathered to say no to lies and yes to love, truth and the American way. To name these overwhelmingly peaceful gatherings as mobs dishonors me, my family, members of my church and so many others who participated in them. As a Christian, my religious tradition also admonishes me to speak the truth in love. Therefore, I prayerfully ask those who have run this ad and others like it, to stop your false witness. Instead, and especially in these times, our country and our world need all of us, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, pagans and all people of faith, to work on behalf of the dignity of all human beings.

MP's office raided by police w/o a warrant                    On the day of the Queen's speech (an excellent 4 minute background video  here  concerning this annual event) in which she  outlines her Government's programs  (video of this year's speech  here ) comes  a horrible revelation from the Speaker of the Commons: the Metropolitan Police raided the Shadow Immigration Minister's office without a warrant, and the Speaker basically just  assumed  (not unreasonably) that they had a warrant. Regardless...  Members' gasps about 1 minute into his statement are telling as to this situation's severity. It was painful to watch the Speaker of the Commons read his statement ; but, I think that Speaker Martin will probably not have to resign. The entire situation seems to be a terrible mess; but, aides and the Metropolitan Police share a great deal of the blame probably most of it. Also, clearly some Tory MPs have grossly politicized this situation.     I am very cynical about elected officials wherever in the world I find them, mainly because almost all elected officials remain first and foremost politicians. I could write of a NYC council member who when running for his office had his family members stalk and threaten a rival campaign's workers. I witnessed firsthand the self-described Christian soldiers of the religious right take over the Republican Party in Iowa in the 1980s with a conviction--a self-righteousness--and efficacy that still are not appreciated by most historians, and raise up literally theocratic candidates into public offices throughout the Hawkeye state (as the religious right did in other states then and since). I've been uncomfortably pulled between opposing Democratic candidates vying for higher office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and been pressured by Democratic machine politicians. Gore Vidal's play  The Best Man  is timeless because of its keen message that ""the best candidate"" is a  profoundly relative concept , and too often we as fickle voters conclude that the best option among candidates for an elected office was--is--simply the one who wins...only to quickly change our minds when it suits us.   Yet, the powers of the police and the state can never be allowed to run roughshod over the rights of elected officials and legislative institutions representing, however imperfectly (often criminally imperfectly--e.g., Sen. Ted Stevens), the will of the people in a democracy. (Yet...such officials cannot be considered above the law.) What is more, sometimes, even if often for self-serving reasons, elected officials occasionally serve as ""whistle blowers"" about abuse in government agencies or legislative bodies themselves. I was a Research Assistant to the Labour Party Spokesman for Trade & Industry, and I can assure you that MPs--especially those in the Opposition--do not have the size of staff, the power, or the prestige of Representatives in the US Congress. To see the police maneuver around and also out-maneuver the Speaker--with malice or not--in order to raid an MP's office is a sad thing.   Nick Robinson further and much more succinctly  puts these events in perspective  in his  blog on the BBC's website . He sums it up better I can in my above blather. In short:     It is now clear that the police have some very serious questions to answer about the way they behaved. So too the Speaker and his officials. So too ministers who were involved in launching the inquiry.

Starbucks pro-Israel stance                                                 Campaigners will be aware of Starbucks pro-Israel stance, for detailed information please see our Boycott Starbucks page:                      http://www.inminds.com/boycott-starbucks.html                                                               In summary. Starbucks’ chair Howard Schutltz is an active zionist whose own activities include running propaganda seminars on behalf of Israel across campuses in both North America  and Israel.  In recognition for his support of Israel Howard Schultz has been presented with     ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"". Starbucks has sponsored the bowl4isreal event, and despite pulling its stores out of Israel has maintained that it will return in response to questions raised by the Zionist Anti-Defamation League (ADL).                                 We are of course concerned that a humanitarian organization is getting involved with a company that supports apartheid Israel.                               2. Oxfam's double standards                                                 Oxfam’s double standards in co-operating with Starbucks need to be brought to light. A couple of years ago Oxfam turned down a £5000 donation from Prof Honderich because he defended Palestinians right to resort to violence to fight occupation.                                                                                                          The reason Oxfam gave was quoted in the Guardian (9 Oct 2002):                               ”The charity said in a statement: ""The decision to decline Prof Honderich's donation was taken for one reason alone, that Oxfam cannot accept, endorse or benefit from certain opinions given in the book. Oxfam's purpose is to overcome poverty and suffering. We believe that the lives of all human beings are of equal value. We do not endorse acts of violence... No other facts were considered in taking the decision.""                             Jewish Chronicle (18 Oct 20002):                               ”An Oxfam spokeswoman told the JC: ‘We said: No thank you,’ because you condone acts of terrorism and we can’t accept donations from someone taking that standpoint.                 ’Oxfam spokes-woman maintained: ”We can’t condone violence in any form.” She added that the charity would doubtless have been criticised had it accepted the money.”                            At the time Bob Cartridge, head of campaigns for War on Want, when asked about this opinion said:                               ""It is absolutely legitimate to question the sources of donations particularly when they are associated with business or (in this case) a business deal. Accepting a donation implies a degree of endorsement. But in this case I suspect Oxfam has reacted to a vocal pro-Israeli minority and concerns about potential damage to its future fundraising. All NGOs working in Palestine are well aware of this lobby, which complains on a daily basis about any support given to the opposition.""                                         Full articles and more information on it please see the ""boycott news"" page on it:                                     http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-news-0357.html                             3. Fair Trade                                           The Oxfam – Starbucks agreement is being heavily criticized by campaigners for Fair Trade. According to the Organic Consumers’ Association a similar agreement between Oxfam America and Starbucks was an exercise in ‘greenwashing’ i.e. Starbucks getting endorsement from a humanitarian organization in return for a minimal donation towards a project that helped its image.                                                       For an analysis of the discrepancy between the image and the reality please visit:                             http://www.organicconsumers.org/Starbucks/0805_starbucks_greenwashing.htm                           [1] Starbucks tastes Oxfam's brew, Alison Maitland,           Financial Times, 14 October 2004                                                                          SUGGESTED ACTION               We are calling on all campaigners to write to Oxfam asking them to protest Oxfam’s decision to enter an agreement with a pro-Israeli multinational given that they previously rejected a donation from a pro-Palestinian donor on the basis that Oxfam should not be seen to “condone violence in any form…” and that by accepting it Oxfam “would doubtless have been criticised had it accepted the money.”                                We also requests campaigners to raise the issue of greenwashing with Oxfam whose credentials as a promoter of Fair Trade are surely undermined by such an agreement.                              Donors to Oxfam may consider these issues before making future donations, and consider charities less prone to political manipulation and lobbying.               A sample letter is provided below, although we suggest it is more effective if you write your own letters using the points mentioned above. The letter can either be posted or otherwise sent on-line via a complaints form that is available on the Oxfam website:               http://www.oxfam.org.uk/contact/forms/complaints.htm               In either case please email us at  boycott@inminds.co.uk  with the subject line ""Oxfam campaign"" just to let us know that you have complained, that way we can accurately gauge the response to this campaign. Also please forward  us  any replies that you receive - this is very important - thank you.                              SAMPLE LETTER:                                                                        Barbara Stocking                       Director of Oxfam Great Britain   274 Banbury Road,  Oxford,   OX2 7DZ   United Kingdom                                          The Date                                             Dear Ms Stocking,                                            Oxfam Collaboration With Starbucks                                           I am writing to complain your recent decision to enter an agreement with the pro-israeli multinational Starbucks. As you will know Starbucks is the target of a worldwide boycott for its support of Israeli apartheid (see www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-starbucks.html). It is shameful that a humanitarian organisation like Oxfam can be bought out by a multinational, and that for a paltry £100,000.                     Two years ago  you rejected a donation of £5000 from Prof Honderich who supports the right of Palestinians to use violence to resist occupation. At the time Oxfam said                                            ""The decision to decline Prof Honderich's donation was taken for one reason alone, that Oxfam cannot accept, endorse or benefit from certain opinions given in [Honderich's] book... Oxfam's purpose is to overcome poverty and suffering. We believe that the lives of all human beings are of equal value.""                                         So then by accepting Starbucks money Oxfam is clearly endorsing their support for israeli apartheid. Apparently the lives of Palestinians, suffering under occupation, are worth less to Oxfam and can be bought for £100,000.                      You cannot claim to help people with one hand whilst at the same time with the other  hand endorse their oppression.                    I am disgusted by this sell out and double standards. I will no longer support Oxfam and will urge others to do the same.                      I would  like an explanation for your decision in partnering with Starbucks whilst knowing that it supports apartheid Israel.                      Awaiting your prompt reply.                    Yours faithfully,                                                                  Your Sign                       Your Name & Address                                                                                                           Sample Letter  (Word Format)                                                           REPLY               One of our campaigners forwarded us the replies he received from Oxfam:                                                                     OXFAM: REPLY TO SAMPLE LETTER                     Thank you very much for your message to Oxfam in which you expressed your concerns regarding the involvement of Starbucks in supporting Israeli actions in the Middle East. Your feedback is important to us as it enables us to assess how our work is being perceived.                     Oxfam is an internationally established and renowned aid organisation that delivers projects in over 80 countries around the world aimed at reducing poverty and suffering. We work largely with other organisations and due to Charity Commission guidelines take great care in choosing those who we develop partnerships with. This maintains our integrity and professional reputation.                     It is important to note that this collaboration with Starbucks is purely about working with coffee farmers and improving their livelihoods. We believe that by working together we can achieve a great deal for these farmers.                     Independent organisations have verified that of all the specialist coffee companies Starbucks leads the way with its policy of ethical purchasing and corporate social responsibility. It consistently pays more than double the current market price for its coffee compared to other major coffee roasting companies. Nevertheless, it has pledged to increase further their purchase of Fairtrade coffee and also to develop ways to benefit coffee-growing communities.                     With respect to your concerns we have found no evidence that Starbucks as an organisation is pro-Israeli. Starbucks have made it clear that any comments made by Mr. Schultz were made as a private citizen and not in his capacity as chair of Starbucks. At the time of the original allegations against Mr. Schultz, Starbucks said: ""Starbucks is an international company, wherever we operate we embrace diversity and strive to be locally relevant. Starbucks has no involvement or interest in politics anywhere in the world.""                     We are therefore happy to enter into collaboration with them and accept a donation to fund the work in Ethiopia.  Starbucks UK already has some experience of relief work in southern Ethiopia. They have been working on developing health, clean water and education schemes in Bensa Ware. However, if we feel that any of Starbucks business practices are or become inconsistent with the aims and goals of this collaboration we will review our relationship with them.                     We are viewing this collaboration with Starbucks as an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the benefits that can come from non-governmental organisations working with private businesses. It will also further publicise Fairtrade practices to other organisations.                     You also mentioned Oxfam's rejection of Professor Honderich's donation in 2002. The reason for that was due to the gift being from the royalties of his book in which he justified targeted violence against civilians. I hope that you appreciate that our collaboration with Starbucks is very different from the Honderich case as that would have severely compromised Oxfam's principles.                     Oxfam has a considerable presence in the Palestinian Territories and is working hard to prevent humanitarian disasters and the urgent need for civilian protection.                     Oxfam has been working in the Palestinian Territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) and Israel since 1949 where we are advocating for a just and peaceful solution to the conflict.

With best wishes,                     Ingrid Kamikazi                      Supporter Relations                      Oxfam                                                                                                                                                                                        CAMPAIGNER: 2ND LETTER TO OXFAM                      Dear Ingrid,                      I am disappointed by your reply. Its interesting how you so easily separate Schultz from his company in order to facilitate your business with Starbucks.                      If the Chairman of a company was a proud nazi would you do business with the company if they said that their CEOs nazi activities were a private matter not related to the company even though they proudly displayed his award for best nazi on their company website?                                                                                                                                                                            OXFAM: 2ND REPLY                      Thank you very for taking the time to get back to us. Please allow me to explain further what prompted Oxfam to enter into a partnership with Starbucks.                      The initial contact between Oxfam and Starbucks was caused by the developing coffee crisis in 2001 when coffee prices slumped. This resulted in Starbucks providing information on its coffee purchasing practices for a report by Oxfam entitled 'Mugged: Poverty in your coffee cup'. A recent update has found Starbucks to be a leader in responsible coffee purchasing including Fairtrade.                      Starbucks has imposed upon itself purchasing guidelines that are much more rigorous that those set out by the Common Code for the Coffee Community. Starbucks rewards suppliers who meet key quality, environmental, financial and social criteria.                      Oxfam and Starbucks are both very concerned about the coffee crisis as neither organisation wants to see the production of coffee curtailed. This joint vision has under-pinned the drive towards a mutually beneficial collaboration between Oxfam and Starbucks.                      During the negotiations Oxfam has remained independent from Starbucks. This is essential such that we maintain our credibility, reputation and therefore our influence as a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Oxfam remains fully independent of Starbucks, we are not spokespeople for the company and we would criticise Starbucks as we would any other company if we felt that any of their business practices were inconsistent with the goals and values of this collaboration.                      Starbucks will also help Ethiopian farmers get a fairer price for their products and open up new markets for their coffee. This contributes to the economic recovery and stability of 700,000 smallholders in Ethiopia that depend upon coffee for their livelihoods. Starbucks UK already has also some experience of relief work in Southern Ethiopia.                      Just to reiterate , we believe that Mr Schultz remarks were made as a private citizen, not as his capacity as CEO of Starbucks, and therefore should not affect the collaboration between the companies.As a commercial organisation they do not get involved in international or local politics.                      We will continue to work with Starbucks for as long as we consider the collaboration to be contributing to the reduction of poverty and suffering, and only while we remain happy that Starbucks are continuing in their commitment to consistently improving their buying practices and making efforts to help poor farmers.                      I hope that this helps understand the choice Oxfam has made when entering into this collaboration.                      Please do not hesitate to contact us for further information.                      With best wishes,                      Ingrid Kamikazi                    Supporter Relations                     Oxfam                                                                                                                                                      CAMPAIGNER: 3ND LETTER TO OXFAM                      Dear Ingrid                       You have totally ignored the two points I raised. Please answer them.                            1. If Schultz was a nazi instead of a zionist would you still conveniently separate him from his company and do business with Starbucks?        2. If Schultz support for Israeli apartheid is personal and not related to Starbucks then why did Starbucks proudly display the ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award"" given to Schultz which ""salutes leaders who have played key roles in promoting close alliance between the United States and Israel"", on their Awards and Accolades page until recently?        If you think that you are still independent of Starbucks, you are deluding yourselves - the blood on their hands is now on yours - that is the price you pay for getting in to bed with such a multinational. Your credibility and reputation are gone - was the £100,000 worth it?                                       OXFAM DID NOT REPLY                                                                                                                       This photo of a boycott banner was recently taken in the middle-east. It shows Oxfam's logo along side companies supporting Israel (next to Sara Lee). Interestingly Starbucks doesn't appear on the banner - perhaps this is to highlight the hurt caused by Oxfams betrayal to people who had once regarded it highly. Oxfam's reputation in tatters - all for a meagre £100,000.                                                                                SUPPORTING ORGANISATIONS:             This campaign is also being supported by the following organisations:                             Palestinian Return Centre                                                     Friends of Al-Aqsa                                                     Scottish Palestine Solidarity Camapaign                                                     Muslim Association of Britain                                       MEDIA CONTACT:            To arrange interviews regarding this campaign please contact:                           Islamic Human Rights Commission                  Email:  info@ihrc.org                  Telephone: 02089044222                  Mobile: 07958522196                                      CONCLUSION:              28th February 2005:              We are proud to announce that, following a series of discussions with Oxfam regarding its agreement with pro-Zionist multinational coffee chain Starbucks, Oxfam has decided, just 4 months into the contract, that it will not be renewing its 1 year contract with Starbucks, which terminates this September.              We would like to thank all activists and organisations who have campaigned to ensure Oxfam adheres to its stated values and principles. This victory shows what is possible when people come together and stand united in the struggle for justice.                                                                                               28 February 2005                    ALERT UPDATE: Oxfam to Announce End of Relations with Starbucks                    Background          Suggested Action                     The Islamic Human Rights Commission and Innovative Minds, supported by Friends of al-Aqsa, the Palestinian Return Centre, the Muslim Association of Britain, and the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, have been in a series of discussions with Oxfam regarding its agreement with pro-Zionist multinational coffee chain Starbucks. IHRC is proud to inform campaigners that Oxfam is soon to announce that it will not be renewing its 1 year contract with Starbucks, which terminates this September.                     In October 2004, it emerged that Starbucks had agreed to contribute £100,000 to Oxfam's rural development programme in the East Harare coffe growing region of Ethiopia. (Please see the Innovative Minds page dedicated to this at: http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-oxfam.html).                     Starbucks’ chair Howard Schultz is a pro-Zionist activist whose own activities include helping student projects in North America and Israel give presentations on the Israeli perspective of the Intifada. Starbucks has sponsored the bowl4isreal event in addition to supporting occupation troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. For further information, see http://www.inminds.com/boycott-starbucks.html                     IHRC and Inminds would like to thank all campaigners and organisations who have struggled to ensure that Oxfam continues to adhere to the humanitarian values and principles which have guided it throughout its history. It is a sure sign that victory is achievable only when those struggling for justice stand united in their efforts for the common good.

Friends of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union:   Please join us once again this year to call on Starbucks to honor Martin Luther King Day by paying the same holiday premium that it pays on five other federal holidays to baristas who work on those days.   Last year after your grassroots actions, Starbucks was forced to admit publicly for the first time that it does not pay its time-and-a-half holiday premium on Dr. King's federal holiday.  Yet, the company persisted in denying the holiday premium and continued to treat Dr. King's day as a second-class event.   Please take a moment to participate in an e-mail action telling Starbucks that we're not backing down and that it must honor Dr. King's Day on January 19th, 2009 with the same holiday premium it pays on five other federal holidays.    Click here to take action .   Thank you for all that you do for working families.          Starbucks' Union Blues [BusinessWeek] Submitted by SWU on Wed, 12/31/2008 - 1:35pm.      December 31, 2008   Starbucks' legal wrangles with a union that wants to organize its baristas is tarnishing the coffee chain's reputation for social responsibility   By Moira Herbst   Starbucks (SBUX), once the undisputed leader in premium-price caffeine fixes, has long cultivated a corporate image for social responsibility, environmental awareness, and sensitivity to workers' rights. Now that carefully crafted reputation is under assault, thanks to a messy legal dispute with a group called the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) (part of the Industrial Workers of the World, or IWW), which started recruiting employees in 2004 and now claims 300 members.   The National Labor Relations Board found on Dec. 23 that Starbucks had illegally fired three New York City baristas as it tried to squelch the union organizing effort. The 88-page ruling also says the company broke the law by giving negative job evaluations to other union supporters and prohibiting employees from discussing union issues at work. The judge ordered that the three baristas be reinstated and receive back wages. The judge also called on Starbucks to end discriminatory treatment of other pro-union workers at four Manhattan locations named in the case. The decision marks the end of an 18-month trial in New York City that pitted the ubiquitous multinational corporation against a group of twentysomething baristas who are part of the Industrial Workers of the World.        read more   Starbucks Loses Round in Battle Over Union  [New York Times] Submitted by SWU on Wed, 12/31/2008 - 1:33pm.      December 24, 2008   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   A National Labor Relations Board judge ruled on Tuesday that Starbucks had illegally fired three baristas and otherwise violated federal labor laws in seeking to beat back unionization efforts at several of its Manhattan cafes.   The administrative law judge, Mindy E. Landow, found that Starbucks had also broken the law by issuing negative job evaluations to union supporters and prohibiting employees from discussing the union even though the employees were allowed to discuss other subjects not related to work.   The judges ruling shows that this company has trampled on workers rights to organize a labor union, said one of the fired baristas, Daniel Gross, who is a longtime leader of the effort by the Industrial Workers of the World to unionize Starbucks workers in New York, Minnesota, Michigan and other states.   Judge Landow ordered that Mr. Gross and the two other baristas be reinstated to their jobs and receive back wages. She also ordered Starbucks to pledge to end what she said was discriminatory treatment toward workers who supported the union at four of its Manhattan shops: 200 Madison Avenue at 36th Street, 145 Second Avenue at 9th Street, 15 Union Square East and 116 East 57th Street.        read more   Judge Finds Starbucks Guilty of Extensive Union-Busting Submitted by SWU on Tue, 12/23/2008 - 6:35pm.      For Immediate Release:  Starbucks Workers Union (Industrial Workers of the World)   Contact: StarbucksUnion (at) yahoo.com   Judge Finds Starbucks Guilty of Extensive Union-Busting   The IWW Scores Big Victory Over Global Coffee Chain   New York, NY (Dec. 23, 2008)- Following a lengthy trial here last year, a National Labor Relations Board judge has found Starbucks guilty of extensive violations of federal labor law in its bid to counter the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.  In an 88-page decision, Judge Mindy E. Landow found, among other things, that Starbucks maintained multiple policies which interfered with workers' right to communicate about the union and about working conditions; terminated three workers in retaliation for union activity; and repeatedly discriminated against union supporters.  The decision comes despite a 2006 New York settlement in which Starbucks pledged to stop illegal anti-union activities and mirrors federal government action against the company for its conduct toward baristas in Minnesota and Michigan.        read more   We Won't Back Down: Starbucks Manager Threatens Lawsuit and Criminal Complaint Against IWW Submitted by SWU on Wed, 12/17/2008 - 2:49pm.      Statement of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union followed by threat letter received yesterday   December 17, 2008   The IWW Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) and our dear friends in the global movement for worker justice have been campaigning against Starbucks for punitively denying two weeks of work to an SWU member who went home ill from a shift one day.  In these terrible economic times, barista Anna Hurst absolutely must receive the compensation she is owed to pay rent and put food on the table for her two children.   Instead of paying the money owed, a lawyer for Starbucks store manager Gwendolyn Krueger has now threatened a frivolous lawsuit and even a criminal complaint against the Industrial Workers of the World.  To call the truthful expression of our collective voice harassment and libel is both offensive and wrong as a matter of law.      Let us be clear: the IWW Starbucks Workers Union takes our right to defend baristas' interests and our right to free speech very seriously.  We do not back down in any respect in response to baseless threats of litigation --- the struggle for secure work hours and respect on the job at Starbucks is too important.   The movement toward justice for Anna and all working people continues full-steam ahead at  www.StarbucksUnion.org  and  www.iww.org .   ---Starbucks Managers' Lawsuit-Criminal Complaint Threat Letter---   Hilary Cathcart, Esq.  1020 Grand Concourse  Bronx, New York, 10451   12/15/08   Industrial Workers of the World  General Headquarters  4001 Hamilton Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45223, USA   Dear Industrial Workers of the World,   This CEASE AND DESIST ORDER is to inform you that your intimidating actions against Gwendolyn Krueger have become intolerable. Posting of Ms. Kruegers personal phone number on your website and encouraging your members to phone and text her constitutes harassment. Referring to her as a liar on your website is libelous and actionable.   This letter is to demand that your harassment and intimidation CEASE AND DESIST immediately. Should you continue to pursue these activities in violation of this CEASE AND DESIST ORDER, I will not hesitate to pursue further legal action against you including, but not limited to, civil action and/or criminal complaints. This CEASE AND DESIST ORDER also demands that you immediately discontinue and do not at any point in the future under any circumstances do any of the following to Gwendolyn Krueger: speak to, contact, pursue, harass, telephone (via cellular or landline), instant message, page, fax, email, follow, stalk, shadow, disturb her peace, keep her under surveillance, gather information about her and/or block her movements at home, work, social gatherings, religious functions and/or any other reasonable day-to-day activities.   Should you willfully choose to continue your current course of action, I will not hesitate to file a complaint with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for your ongoing violations of the laws in effect in New York.   Note that a copy of this letter and a record of its delivery will be stored. Note too that it is admissible as evidence in a court of law and will be used as such if need be in the future.   This letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of my position nor is it a waiver of any of my clients or my rights and/or remedies in this and/or any other related matter.

Nonsense!  Rap Music Is American, of African Roots             By Pearl Duncan    The author is completing a book, tentatively titled,  ""DNA Inheritance: Sex, Secrets, Strengths in Roots.""         This past week the news broke in many media, including  the  New York Times ,  that   American rap music derives from Scotland's medieval pubs.  The British    Telegraph   newspaper quoted an American professor who cited,  ""an American   civil war poem, printed in the New York Vanity magazine on November 9, 1861,   as the first recorded example of the verbal battles being used in the United   States.""  He identified  ""flyting,""  a medieval Scottish style of word duels   in pubs, between nasty-mouthed drunken poets as the roots of American rap   music.  That's nonsense.   Verbal duels, especially between poets, existed in many of our ancient   cultures; they did not start in medieval days in a single culture.  Specific   people's ancestors are at the roots of their cultural traditions.  Others,   however, have tried to steal African American culture because they, and so   many African Americans, do not know the specific ancestors at the roots of   African American DNA.  So let me, Speak girl, as my ancestors would say.   One of the advantages of genealogical research is that the results uncovered   fill in the gaps, errors or misconceptions of history.  An American history   professor who specializes in American and Scottish studies announced that   rap music, which was born in the Bronx, New York, has its roots in the   Scottish verbal dueling tradition called,  "" flyting ,""  and the media does   not take him to task.  As an American whose extensive genealogical research   resulted in a genuine, Queen of England granted Scottish coat of arms, I   challenge him.  I comment by whispering in the wind --  Cease the nonsense!   My Scottish coat of arms, revealing ten generations of recovered ancestral   documents, based on ten years research into my ancestry, was  granted  in   2005.  As a newly   discovered descendant of Scottish nobles, who were,  --   and are  --    relatives of  the kings and queens of Scotland and England, I understand   blended history, and do not have to distort it.   As a descendant of African ancestors who lived among the griots, who were   storytellers of Ancient Mali and Ancient Ghana, who sang of political and   communal events in medieval times, I know my ancestors' contributions to   world culture.  I know their contributions have been overlooked.   As a descendant of Jamaican ancestors, whose reggae music parodied   political, local and personal events, whose farmers sang competitive work   songs, whose market women,  ""higglers""  sang competing songs to sell their   fruit and vegetables, I celebrate the complexity of our roots.      As a New Yorker, raised in Manhattan and the Bronx, where young musicians   were so creative and improvisational on their musical turntables, in their   angst, and in poetry,  I say, Don't even think about distorting the roots of   this history.   As an American, a student of pop culture, I say, Stop the nonsense!  America   has grownup, and now accepts the blending of culture at its roots; it now   sees and accepts the contribution of black Americans to the Americas and the   world.  Let's celebrate the richness at its roots, not muddy or distort its   heritage:  America's blended heritage with African origins.   The professor said Scottish slaveowners brought the verbal tradition to   America, taught it to the African slaves, African Americans, who, centuries   later, gave birth to rap music.  He credits Scotland with the birth of   hip-hop rap music.  So he's saying rap music, derived from anti-slavery fighting roots, was taught to the slaves by the slaveowners who enslaved them.   Right.  His research is hollow.  Shallow.  Reports such as this one from   historians are ignorant of the tug-of-war and the subtle blending of   cultures in American colonial times.  My research revealed that I am   descended from slaves and Free Colonial Americans, people who were   originally farmers and village leaders in medieval Ghana.  I used family   nicknames, folk stories and DNA to locate and confirm these ancestors.  I   found records of how they intermixed and blended with Scottish slaveowners   and abolitionists, some of whom were nobles.   My genealogical research revealed how extensive the blending was, in a   variety of arenas, from slavery battlefields to wilderness churches.  My   ancestors, Scots and Africans, met in bush wars and, in religious   fellowship.  On my family tree in Jamaica, Ghanaians from West Africa were   mostly Akans, Fante and Akuapem people.  They were first cousins of the   Ashante and other Akan people who settled in Suriname in the wilds on the   northern coasts of South America.   A Scottish commissioned officer, Captain John Stedman, who led the slavers'   militias against these Akans and also Congolese Angolans, described how the   African slaves who fled to the wilds and fought for their freedom   participated in verbal duels on the battlefields.  These Africans were   called runaways, Maroons.  They fought fiercely, including using verbal   warfare now called playing-the-dozens.  So don't tell me about the roots of   African American music.  It was not 1861 in  Vanity Fair.   In his    Narrative of a Five-Years' Expedition, Against the   Revolted Negroes of Surinam in Guiana from the Wild Coast of  South America   from the Years 1772 to 1777 ,  a 704-page colonial war journal, Captain Stedman described   the songs, chants, praise-poetry, verbal dueling, posturing and martial arts   ""capoeira-style"" flying moves these African ancestors used in anti-slavery   warfare.  Their dueling battled, characterized by a war of words, drumming,   dancing and singing, among English-speaking Maroons were called  ""plays,""   and among the Dutch-speaking Maroons,  ""baljarden.""  The tradition was a   rendition of the remnants of medieval word-plays of young men who defended   their African villages against enemies and invasions in medieval Ghana.  The   Fante and Ashante young men formed military organizations,  ""asafo,""  in   which they wielded words, songs and dances, rivaling in verbal duels,   military dance duels, and anti-slavery village defenses.   So don't tell me about the roots of this dueling verbal art form.   In America in the 1770s, Captain Stedman described the verbal duels these   Ghanaians and Angolans who were Maroons threw at his militia soldiers on the   battlefields.  ""They told us . . . they scorned to expend much more of their   powder on such scarecrows; but should the planters and overseers dare enter   the woods, not a soul of them should ever return . . . .""  The Maroons, in   graphic curse words,  also hurled curses at the black soldiers the militias   recruited to combat Maroons in the American wilds.  Stedman's 704-page war   journal said, these African American Maroons hurled words at them, calling   them,  ""poltrons  [cowards, wretches]  and traitors of their countrymen,   challenging them the next day to single combat; swearing they only wished to   lave  [wash]  their hands in the blood of such scoundrels, who had been the   principal agents in destroying their flourishing settlement.""  The other   curse words were more graphic.   So let's not steal this history from these ancestors.   In my book-in-progress I describe how the spiritual traditions came   together, how the call-and-response form of church worship and musical   performances, ritual word plays, and sing-song music, which is now so   popular in our African American churches and in American and world music   concerts, blended.  The  oral styles of Scottish-Irish-English religious   worship and African charismatic spirituality and anti-slavery military   traditions came together, in America.  In my book, I say,  ""We inherited the   DNA of blended cultures.""   We are a people with the blended DNA of a   variety of ancestors.   The capoeira-style verbal gymnastics of the Africans blended with the   ""lining out,""  the calling out of words the Scots brought.  Scots added to   the African  ""griot,""  style of storytelling, and  ""asafo,""  defensive   verbal gymnastics, but the verbal style that gave rise to   charismatic-call-and-response music in American and Caribbean churches, to   reggae, soca jamback, and rap, were all African at the root of their   polyrhythms.  The style is still heard today in Akan  ""asafo""  festivals in   the Fante villages in Ghana, Africa, where I found my family's DNA marches.   Medieval military battles evolved into festive celebrations of cultural   contests.   The  ""lining out""  traditions, verbal call-and-response, my Scottish   ancestors brought to wilderness worship was added to the oral traditions and   musical styles my African ancestors brought to America.  It did not give   rise to them.  It was not at the root.  The Africans arriving in the   Americas as slaves continued to practice their music, gathering in the   wilderness fields, around a griot, and responding to a single  ""griot""   speaker-singer, who sang, in a sing-song, telltale voice.  They retained the   resistance, word-play, sing-song style of their medieval African ancestors.   Their descendants in the Bronx, New York, created rap music from African   ancestors'cultural DNA.

"" By Poster: This is One More Reason WHY WE NEED THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT NOW!""  www.Employeefeechoiceactnow.org          Click on image for a larger version           An administrative trial that was scheduled for today has been canceled, and the agreement is expected to be signed this week, said Chet Byerly, resident officer for the NLRB in Grand Rapids. He would not disclose details of the proposed agreement.    A Starbucks spokeswoman confirmed that it is working on a settlement.    It is the third time in a month that Starbucks has faced action from the NLRB regarding the Industrial Workers of the World union.    Last month, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Starbucks took part in unfair labor practices at several of its New York cafes.    Last week, the Seattle chain settled a separate NLRB dispute in Michigan.    All three cases were initiated by baristas affiliated with the IWW, a century-old union that has worked for several years to improve conditions for Starbucks workers.    In New York last month, an NLRB judge ordered Starbucks to give back jobs to three former workers and compensate them for lost earnings. The company also must post notices informing employees of their labor-organizing rights.    Starbucks plans to appeal the ruling, according to spokeswoman Tara Darrow.    Such appeals often take a year and might last longer now that the NLRB's board has lost three of its five members, said University of Tennessee law professor Jeff Hirsch, a former attorney at the NLRB.    Last week's settlement stemmed from a complaint that barista and IWW member Cole Dorsey made to the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration about a leaky air conditioner.    In interviewing at least one Starbucks worker about the matter, attorneys at a local law firm representing Starbucks neglected to issue legally required warnings that help prevent coercive questioning.       ""We contend that these warnings are not necessary when dealing with an occupational safety charge. The NLRB disagreed,"" Darrow said in an e-mail. ""We elected to settle the matter to avoid litigation.""    Starbucks did not admit wrongdoing but must post a notice in the affected store in Grand Rapids ""saying they won't do it again,"" said NLRB Regional Director Stephen Glasser.    Dorsey, the barista who complained about the air conditioner, was fired in June after working for Starbucks almost two years. The NLRB charges that he was dismissed because of his union activities.    He was fired eight months after Starbucks and the IWW settled an agreement over unionizing efforts by employees at his Grand Rapids store. At that time, Starbucks agreed to post notices in that store advising employees of their unionizing rights.    Such settlements never come with fines and rarely with admissions of wrongdoing. The Employee Free Choice Act, which stalled in the last session of Congress, would allow the NLRB to order fines in some situations, according to former NLRB attorney Hirsch. The bill faces strong opposition from the business community.     In October, Starbucks settled a similar complaint in Minneapolis regarding another employee who claimed he was fired for encouraging co-workers to join the IWW.

Waksal  and Stewart's broker at Merrill Lynch,  Peter Bacanovic .

Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (December 2007)       ImClone's stock price dropped sharply at the end of  2001  when its drug  Erbitux , an experimental  monoclonal antibody  failed to get the expected  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) approval. It was later revealed by the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  that prior to the announcement (after the close of trading on  December 28 ) of the FDA's decision numerous executives sold their stock.   Its founder,  Samuel D. Waksal , was arrested in  2002  on  insider trading  charges for informing friends and family to sell their stock, and attempting to sell his own. His daughter, Aliza Waksal, sold $2.5 million in shares on  December 27 . His father, Jack Waksal, sold $8.1 million in shares over the 27th and 28th. Company executives followed suit too. John B. Landes, the general counsel, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 6. Ronald A. Martell, the vice president for marketing and sales, sold $2.1 million in shares on December 11. Four other executives sold shares in the following weeks as well. Later, founder Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including  securities fraud , and on  June 10 ,  2003 , was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.   Martha Stewart , the founder of  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , also became embroiled in the scandal after it emerged that she sold about $230,000 in ImClone shares on December 27, just a day before the announcement of FDA decision. Although Stewart maintained her innocence, she was found guilty and sentenced on  July 16 ,  2004  to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years probation for lying about a stock sale, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice.   Ultimately a new clinical trial and FDA filing prepared by Imclone's partner  Merck KGaA  (""German Merck"" not to be confused with the US company of similar name) resulted in an FDA approval of Erbitux in 2004 for use in colon cancer.   A Congressional hearing on improprieties at ImClone, held in October 2002, unveiled a culture of corruption dating back to 1986. This was the year that ImClone CEO Waksal first forged the signature of the company's general counsel John Landes (one of the three original employees of the company) for financial gain. Nonetheless, Landes defended Waksal's illegal actions at the hearings before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, portraying the forgery as ""a good-faith misunderstanding,"" to which Representative James Greenwood replied ""My children know better than that, Mr. Landes."" Further questioning about this and subsequent forgeries on Waksal's part revealed that neither Landes, the chief legal officer of the company, or the company's outside directors reported Waksal's actions to proper authorities or made any moves to have Waksal removed as CEO. Instead, testimony revealed that they initiated their own internal investigation, which was never concluded. The decades-long tolerance for Waksal's fraud, starting from the company's earliest days, provoked Representative Peter Deutsch to refer to the ongoing misconduct as ""wacky.""   The FDA's February 2004 announcement of approval for use of Erbitux for treatment of colrectal cancer reported that conclusions were drawn from a trial involving 329 patients, of which 10.8% responded when Erbitux was used by itself, delaying tumor growth by 1.5 months. When used in conjunction with a standard treatment irinotecan, 22.9% of patients responded and tumor growth was delayed by approximately 4.1 months.   In September 2001, Bristol-Meyers Squibb committed $2 billion (including a $1 billion up-front cash payment) for less than 20% of ImClone due to what was called at the time the drug's ""blockbuster"" potential.   In January 2006, the company was put up for sale but failed to find any buyers, likely because Erbitux by that time faced significant competition in the medical marketplace. ImClone directors withdrew the sale of the company in mid-2006.   In April 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported that ""Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and ImClone Systems Inc. said their cancer drug, Erbitux, failed to significantly prolong the lives of people with pancreatic cancer in a new study, marking yet another setback in the drug industry's efforts to find a better treatment for this deadly disease.""     [ edit ]   Indictment and SEC charges   Waksal was arrested  June 12 ,  2002  on charges of conspiring to commit  insider trading . On  October 15 , he pleaded guilty to charges of  securities fraud ,  bank fraud ,  obstruction of justice , and  perjury .   On  March 3 ,  2003  he pleaded guilty to charges of  conspiracy  and  wire fraud  for avoiding $1.2 million in sales taxes on $15 million in artwork. The art included works by  Mark Rothko ,  Richard Serra ,  Roy Lichtenstein , and  Willem de Kooning , purchased between June 2000 and October 2001. He did not pay the necessary taxes at the time of purchase, but did pay the taxes in fall 2002.   On  June 10 ,  2003 , Waksal was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison and ordered to pay more than $4 million in fines and back taxes, all the maximum punishments allowable under law. Waksal is not eligible for parole. He is currently serving time in the  Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville  in  New York state  as inmate number 53803-054.   On  June 4 ,  2003 , a federal grand jury in  Manhattan  indicted Stewart and her former broker,  Peter Bacanovic  on nine criminal counts. The government alleged that, by selling when she did, Stewart avoided losses of $45,673. The charges included securities fraud,  obstruction of justice , and  conspiracy . Stewart plead not guilty, saying she had a standing order with Bacanovic to sell her shares if  ImClone  stock fell below $60. Stewart resigned as CEO and chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia on the same day she was indicted, but remained on the company's board.  [ 1 ]   The day after her  indictment , Stewart took out a full-page advertisement in  USA Today  and launched a website with an open letter of defense ""to my friends and loyal supporters."" She said, ""I want you to know that I am innocent  and that I will fight to clear my name... The government's attempt to criminalize these actions makes no sense to me... I am confident I will be exonerated of these baseless charges.""   On the day she was indicted, the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  filed a civil complaint  [1]  against Stewart with charges of insider trading (for violating  17(a) of the  Securities Act of 1933 ,  10(b) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , and  SEC Rule 10b-5 ).  [2]  The civil charges were stayed pending the criminal proceeding.  [3]     [ edit ]   Trial   Stewart's trial was initially set for  January 12 ,  2004 , at the request of her lawyers who said they needed plenty of time to analyze the evidence. The trial eventually began on  January 20  in New York City presided over by U.S. District Judge  Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum . During the trial, Stewart maintained her innocence. [ 2 ]   On  February 27 ,  2004 , Judge Cederbaum threw out the charge of securities fraud which could have led to up to 10 years in prison and a million dollar fine. The judge found that ""no reasonable juror can find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant lied for the purpose of influencing the market for the securities of her own company.""  [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Verdict   The jury deliberated for three days following the five-week trial before reaching its verdict. On  March 5 ,  2004 , Stewart was found guilty by a  jury  of eight women and four men on all four remaining counts against her: conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and two counts of  making false statements . [ 4 ]  She was not found guilty of one of the most publicized charges: having falsely claimed that there was an agreement to sell her shares when they fell to $60.00. The jury did find that Stewart lied and obstructed justice on other grounds, including her claim that she was reminded of the prior $60.00 agreement and urged to sell on that basis.   Following Stewart's conviction, a message was posted on her website, reading, in part, ""I am obviously distressed by the jury's verdict but I continue to take comfort in knowing that I have the confidence and enduring support of my family and friends. I will appeal the verdict and continue to fight to clear my name. I believe in the fairness of the judicial system and remain confident that I will ultimately prevail.""     [ edit ]   Sentencing   On  July 8 , a motion for a new trial was denied and sentencing was set for  July 16 . Martha Stewart and Peter Bacanovic were each sentenced to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years probation for lying about a stock sale, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. Stewart was ordered to pay a $30,000 fine, while Bacanovic was fined $4,000. The judge stayed the sentence while they prepared their appeals.  [ 5 ]   On  September 15 ,  2004 , accompanied by her lawyers and members of the board of directors of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Stewart held a press conference to announce her decision to begin serving her sentence as soon as possible while vowing to continue ahead with her appeal. [ 6 ]  The event was featured live on national television. On  September 21 , she was ordered by US District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum to surrender by  October 8  to begin her sentence. On  September 29 , the  Federal Bureau of Prisons  announced that Stewart would serve her sentence at the federal prison camp in  Alderson, West Virginia , denying her request to serve it at the  federal prison  in  Danbury, Connecticut . She reported to  Alderson Federal Prison Camp  early in the morning on  October 8 . Alderson is a minimum security prison, the lowest level of security in the Bureau of Prisons. There are no fences, and inmates are generally free to walk around the compound unescorted. Stewart, who said her prison nickname was ""M. Diddy"", [ 7 ]  reportedly got along quite well with her fellow inmates and kept herself busy with assigned cleaning tasks. She was released on  March 4 ,  2005  at 12:30 AM.   After being released from Alderson, Stewart began to serve her home confinement at her estate in  Bedford, New York . During the confinement she was permitted to leave her property for up to 48 hours a week to conduct business, but was required to wear an electronic  ankle monitor  to monitor her location at all times. On  January 6 ,  2006 , a Federal Appeals court denied Stewart's appeal and upheld the jury's verdict.     [ edit ]   Repercussions and aftermath   On  March 8 ,  2004 ,  Viacom  pulled  Martha Stewart Living  from its  CBS  and  UPN  affiliates, after having moved the show during Stewart's trial from prime daytime timeslots into less desirable early-morning slots (e.g., 2:05am in New York); the show was distributed by another Viacom division,  King World Productions . [ citation needed ]  On  March 15 , Stewart resigned from the board of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Stewart had already resigned from the boards of  The New York Stock Exchange  and  Revlon Cosmetics . On  May 18 , MSO announced that  Martha Stewart Living , was going into hiatus, with no announced date of return. [ citation needed ]   On  May 21 ,  2004  , Larry Stewart (no relation), a  United States Secret Service  lab director who testified for the government against Martha Stewart, was charged with two counts of  perjury . Stock in  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia  jumped as much as 23 percent on the news. Larry Stewart was an expert witness about the ink on a broker's worksheet, testifying that the note about selling ImClone shares when it dropped below $60 was different from the rest of the ink on the document. The charges arose when Susan Fortunato, a USSS co-worker, complained that she had in fact done the analysis and that it had never been examined by Stewart. Although the jury at the perjury trial felt that Larry Stewart had taken unfair credit for the work done, it did not amount to perjury and he was found not guilty on  October 5 ,  2004 . The jury had trouble believing Fortunato, feeling that she had an axe to grind with Stewart. [ citation needed ]   In October, 2005, Stewart was informed that due to her status as a  convicted felon  in the United States, she was inadmissible for entry into Canada under the  Immigration and Refugee Protection Act . Stewart had planned to attend the  Windsor Pumpkin Regatta  in  Nova Scotia . Within two days of the story's breaking, then Canadian  Minister of Citizenship and Immigration   Joe Volpe  granted Stewart a temporary resident permit, thereby allowing her to temporarily enter Canada. [ citation needed ] .   In June, 2008, the  UK Border Agency , operational since 1 April, 2008 with new rules to safeguard British borders, refused to grant her a visa to enter  Great Britain , because of her criminal conviction for obstructing justice. She had been planning to speak at the  Royal Academy  on fashion and leisure industry matters.  [ 8 ] .   In August,  2006 , the  Securities and Exchange Commission  announced that it had agreed to settle the related civil case against Stewart. Under the settlement, Stewart agreed to a five-year bar from serving as a director, or as the CEO, CFO (or other officer roles in which she would be responsible for preparing, auditing, or disclosing financial results), of any public company. She also agreed to pay the maximum penalty of three times the losses she avoided, or $195,000. Bacanovic agreed to pay penalties totaling about $75,000, and was barred associating with a broker, dealer or investment adviser. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   TV movies   Martha: Behind Bars , based on her time in prison, starred  Cybill Shepherd  as Stewart and was aired by  CBS  in  September 2005 . A previous movie,  Martha, Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart , also starring Shepherd, had been aired by  NBC  in  2003 .

We called on him to reject amnesty in light of growing unemployment. He wouldn't.                     John McCain has turned America's nuclear arsenal over to a man Americans know little about.  He has put the interests of Mexico and Mexicans before America and Americans.                     McCain has betrayed us over and over again. It is time to reward his loyalty to America.                     Every Republican in Arizona should rise up and kick McCain out of the Senate.  They should work now to deliver John McCain an overwhelming defeat in the 2010 primary.
