Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC)   The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium, a group of federal land management agencies, is purchasing nation-wide coverage of Landsat 7 data for three dates in order to produce a comprehensive land cover database for the United States.  The goal of the consortium is to meet the needs of Federal agencies for nationally consistent satellite remote sensing and land cover data.  The consortium also provides the imagery and land cover data as public domain information which can be accessed through this  web site .                                 USGS LDCM website released   Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based land remote sensing data. For over 30 years, the Landsat satellite series has collected and produced low-cost, moderate-resolution multispectral data for researchers and decision-makers worldwide. The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) is intended to ensure the continued acquisition and availability of Landsat-quality data into the future. The Department of Interior (DOI)/USGS and NASA are currently engaged in a partnership to support this activity. The new USGS  LDCM website  will provide information and updates as the mission develops over time.                               LP DAAC Crosses Petabyte Threshold  On November 20, 2003, the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) data holdings at the USGS EROS Data Center  crossed the one petabyte threshold in volume .  One petabyte represents 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes, or equivalent to 500 billion standard-size document pages. This data volume is 100 times the volume content of the U.S. Library of Congress. Additional information concerning the LP DAAC and available products may be found at  http://LPDAAC.usgs.gov                                                                                 EO-1 Mission Extended and Prices Reduced!        Based on current funding projections, and in support of Landsat data users, NASA and the USGS plan to extend the  EO-1 mission  at least through fiscal year 2004 (through September).   This assurance enables current and prospective users to plan now for EO-1 data to be captured this summer.   Additional good news for customers comes in the form of a USGS price decrease. The price decrease is the result of recently upgraded data processing equipment and will take effect on January 15, 2004.  Customers now have access to over 20,000 EO-1 archive scenes - either  Hyperion  or  Advanced Land Imager  (ALI) - at $250.00 each,  half the previous price .  While the data acquisition fee remains at $1500 to acquire a new customer-specified scene from anywhere around the globe (poles excepted), the charge for processing the scene data is now $250.00, for a total of $1750.00 vs. the previous total of $2000.00.   Technical note:  As an experimental satellite, EO-1 does not have the capacity to fill in for all data missing from a Landsat 7 scene affected by that satellite's failed scan-line corrector.  The  EO-1 ALI sensor  can image smaller study sites, however, given its 37 km swath width.  ALI scenes typically are acquired in strips 60 km along-track, of which 42 km are usable and are provided in a Level-1 product format.  However, longer scenes (up to 185 km along-track) can be acquired on request at an additional charge.                               Landsat Orthorectified Imagery  Through cooperative efforts between NASA and the commercial remote sensing community, the USGS EROS Data Center released two new Landsat-7 products on December 23, 2003.  The Landsat orthorectified ETM+ imagery and Landsat orthorectified Pan sharpened ETM+ Imagery data sets joined the Landsat orthorectified TM imagery data set, which was used as to establish the baseline for these two new products. Together, these products form a suite of quality-screened, high-resolution satellite images with global coverage over the Earth's landmasses, which provide users with remote sensing data for tracking change over much of the Earth.

GX003-40-13168989	"---------------- LANDSAT 7 ----------------          Supplying data users worldwide with low cost, multi-purpose, land remote sensing data into the next century   Artist's rendering of Landsat 7  (51 kb)     In 1992, the US Congress authorized the procurement, launch and operation  of a new Landsat satellite. This new system, Landsat 7, is now under  construction and is scheduled for launch in April, 1999. It will be the  latest in a series of earth observation satellites dating back to 1972. The  twenty-two year record of data acquired by the Landsat satellites constitutes  the longest continuous record of the earth's continental surfaces. Preservation  of the existing record and continuation of the Landsat capability were  identified in the law as critical to land surface monitoring and global change  research.    Landsat 7 will have a unique and essential role in the realm of earth  observing satellites in orbit by the end of this decade. No other system will  match Landsat's combination of synoptic coverage, high spatial resolution,  spectral range and radiometric calibration. In addition, the Landsat Program  is committed to provide Landsat digital data to the user community in  greater quantities, more quickly and at lower cost than at any previous time  in the history of the program.   The earth observing instrument on Landsat 7, the Enhanced Thematic  Mapper Plus (ETM+), replicates the capabilities of the highly successful  Thematic Mapper instruments on Landsats 4 and 5*. The ETM+ also  includes new features that make it a more versatile and efficient instrument  for global change studies, land cover monitoring and assessment, and large  area mapping than its design forebears. The primary new features on  Landsat 7 are:      a panchromatic band with 15m spatial resolution    on board, full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration    a thermal IR channel with 60m spatial resolution      Landsat 7 and ETM+ Characteristics:       Band Number   Spectral Range (microns)   Ground Resolution (m)       1   .45 to .515   30       2   .525 to .605   30       3   .63 to .690   30       4   .75 to .90   30       5   1.55 to 1.75   30       6   10.40 to 12.5   60       7   2.09 to 2.35   30       Pan   .52 to .90   15               Swath width:   185 kilometers       Repeat coverage interval:   16 days (233 orbits)       Altitude:   705 kilometers       Quantization:   Best 8 of 9 bits       On-board data storage:   ~375 Gb (solid state)       Inclination:   Sun-synchronous, 98.2 degrees       Equatorial crossing:   Descending node; 10:00am +/- 15 min.       Launch vehicle:   Delta II       Launch date:   April 1999            The instrument will be supported by a ground network that will receive  ETM+ data via X-band direct downlink only at a data rate of 150 Mbps. The  primary receiving station will be at the US Geological Survey's (USGS)    EROS Data Center (EDC)  in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Substantially cloud- free, land and coastal scenes will be acquired by  EDC through real-time  downlink, and by playback from an on-board, solid state, recording device. The capacities of the satellite, instrument and ground system will be sufficient to allow for continuous acquisition of all substantially cloud free scenes at the primary receiving station.  In addition, a world-wide network of receiving stations will be able to receive real-time, direct downlink of image data via X-band. Each station will be able to receive data only for that part of the ETM+ ground track where the satellite is in sight of the receiving station.   The Landsat 7 system will insure continuity of Thematic Mapper type data  into the next century. These data will be made available to all users through  EDC at the cost of fulfilling user requests. Browse data (a lower resolution  image for determining image location, quality and information content) and  metadata (descriptive information on the image) will be available, on-line, to  users within 24 hours of acquisition of the image by the primary ground  station. EDC will process all Landsat 7 data received to  ""Level 0R""  ( i.e. corrected for scan direction and band alignment but without radiometric or geometric correction) and archive the data in that format.  A systematically corrected product  (Level 1G)  will be generated and distributed to users on request. The user will have the option of performing further processing on the data on user-operated digital processing equipment or by a commercial, value added firm.   The Landsat 7 spacecraft is being built by Lockheed Martin,  Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The ETM+ instrument is a product of Hughes  Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. Construction of both is managed through  contracts between the manufacturers and the NASA Goddard Space Flight  Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.   The Landsat Program, as defined by Congress in 1992 and amended by   Presidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3 in May, 1994, is managed  cooperatively by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the  USGS. Responsibility for construction of the spacecraft and instrument lies  with NASA. The Landsat Program is part of the NASA's global change  initiative - the Earth Observing System, administered by the NASA Office of  Mission to Planet Earth. Landsat 7 will be operated by NOAA. Data  processing, archiving and distribution will be performed by USGS with  direction from NOAA. These functions will be executed in coordination with  the EDC Distributed Active Archive Center    (EDC DAAC)  of NASA's  Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) at EDC.     *The ETM+ is similar to the ETM instrument on Landsat 6. Landsat 6 was launched in October, 1993, but failed to obtain orbit.

The TM sensors have provided nearly continuous coverage from July 1982 to present, with a 16-day repeat cycle.   TM image data consists of seven spectral bands ( band designations ) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for most bands (1-5 and 7). Resolution for the thermal infrared (band 6) is 120 meters.  The approximate scene size will be 170 x 183 kilometers (106 x 115 miles).     The following level of correction is available to the general public:    Systematic Correction  includes both radiometric and geometric correction. The scene will be rotated, aligned, and georeferenced to a user-defined map projection. Absolute geometric accuracy of the systematically corrected TM product can vary, depending upon the accuracy of the predicted ephemeris that is used for processing.  Users should be aware that subsequent image geocorrection and/or coregistration to known ground control points (GCPs) may be necessary with a TM product.     The following levels of correction are available to  Approved U.S. Government and its Affiliated Users (USGAU)  only:   Precision Correction   includes radiometric and geometric correction, as well as the use of ground control points (GCPs) to improve accuracy. For locations outside the U.S., accuracy of the precision-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local GCPs.     Terrain Correction   includes radiometric, geometric, and precision correction, as well as the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) to correct parallax error due to local topographic relief. For locations outside the U.S., accuracy of the terrain-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local ground control points (GCPs), as well as the resolution of the best available DEM.

Back to Top        Landsat 5 Radiometry -  update    As of May 5, 2003, the USGS EDC has implemented an enhancement to our method of radiometric processing for Landsat 5 TM data. For further information on the background and nature of the changes, please refer to the  Landsat 5 Calibration Notices .   As a result of the improvements in Landsat 5 radiometric processing, users should be aware that the  values for LMAX (and rescaled gains) have changed from previously published values.  For details, see  Revised Landsat 5 TM Radiometric Calibration Procedures (PDF) .   We are working to provide a correction table and algorithm(s) for past customers who have existing Landsat 5 TM data that was generated by NLAPS prior to the radiometric processing enhancement.  As soon as the correction becomes available, details will be posted at:  Landsat 5 Calibration Notices .           Back to Top       Search & Order    All TM scenes in the USGS archive can be searched by geographic location on  Earth Explorer . For scenes that are orderable online and have a browse image available,   GloVis  also provides an alternative ""quick and easy"" image-based search and order tool. If searching by the WRS (Worldwide Reference System) of paths and rows, all Landsat 4/5 TM data is referenced to the  WRS-2  scheme.   The method for placing an order will depend upon the level of correction desired:                   Systematic Correction       Earth Explorer           GloVis             Precision Correction        contact us  (USGAU researchers  only)               Terrain Correction        contact us  (USGAU researchers only)               Recently acquired scenes with direct downlink to USGS EDC should generally become available for search and order within 24 hours of scene acquisition on weekdays (Monday through Friday). Scene acquisitions that occur on Saturdays and/or Sundays will be available for search and order by  the following Monday afternoon.    Locations outside the U.S.:  For international locations, there may be Landsat TM scenes that were collected by the instrument but the scenes are not archived or distributed by the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC).  These scenes may be available from other  International Ground Stations . Note that these data would not be a product of the USGS EDC and therefore the prices, available formats, and/or processing options may vary according to the data provider.    Back to Top       Preview Images   Landsat TM images should always be previewed prior to purchase.  The availability of a browse image for TM will depend on the date and location, but many scenes can be previewed by searching on  Earth Explorer  or  GloVis .   Each TM browse image is a subsampled JPEG of the actual scene data. The browse image is displayed as a 5,4,3 (RGB) composite with a standardized 2% linear stretch applied.

GX000-37-6731474	"LANDSAT 7 DATA POLICY   October 31, 1994   Revised: September 19, 1997       [NOTE:  Approval pending by LPM member organizations]      Introduction  Section 105 of Public Law (P.L.)102-555, The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, states,  ""The Landsat Program Management (LPM), in consultation with other appropriate United States Government agencies, shall develop a data policy for Landsat 7..."". The law also identifies goals for the policy.  This document, in accordance with the law, establishes a data policy for Landsat 7 that covers the acquisition, processing, archival, distribution and pricing policy for Landsat 7 data. Roles and responsibilities for Landsat 7 system development and operations are contained in the Management Plan for the Landsat Program.    As required by P.L. 102-555, this Data Policy is designed to achieve the following:      Ensure that unenhanced data are available to all users at the cost of fulfilling user requests;   Ensure timely and dependable delivery of unenhanced data to the full spectrum of civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign users and the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive (NSLRSDA);   Ensure that the United States retains ownership of all unenhanced data generated by Landsat 7;   Support the development of the commercial market for remote sensing data;   Ensure that the provision of commercial value-added services based on remote sensing data remains exclusively the function of the private sector; and   To the extent possible, ensure that the data distribution system for Landsat 7 is compatible with the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).      The Landsat 7 system will comprise a spacecraft carrying an Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) instrument and a ground segment consisting of mission operations, data capture, ground processing, data archiving, and data product distribution elements. The ETM+ is a nadir-pointing, eight spectral band instrument designed to provide data continuity with the Thematic Mapper instruments on Landsats 4 and 5.    Acquisition   Data acquisition by the ETM+ on Landsat 7 will be directed by the mission goal of acquiring and updating periodically a global archive of daytime, substantially cloud-free images of land areas.  In addition to the periodic global archive acquisitions, Landsat 7 will acquire every daytime scene on every pass over the United States.  However, the Landsat operator will modify the acquisition schedule for the global archive mission and the standing order for scenes of the United States to accommodate time-critical observations and other requests based on the following order of priorities:     Spacecraft and instrument health and safety   Time critical acquisitions related to national security, natural disasters and environmental emergencies   Time critical acquisitions to support large campaigns and other key US Government (USG) programs   Acquisitions critical to the global archive mission   Acquisition requests from individuals and commercial entities     Conflicts in the acquisition schedule will be resolved by the Landsat operator according to the priorities listed above and policy guidelines established by the Landsat Coordinating Group (LCG) acting on behalf of Landsat Program Management.    Non-time critical requests for acquisitions will be received by the EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at the US Geological Survey's EROS Data Center (EDC) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  Requests for time critical acquisitions will be received directly by the Landsat operator.   The primary USG ground station will be located at EDC.  The ground station will have the capability to capture both real-time and recorded data via direct transmission from Landsat 7. Secondary USG ground stations for Landsat 7 will be located in the Fairbanks, Alaska area and Svalbard, Norway.  The secondary station(s) will serve as backup for the primary station and ensure that the requirement for scene acquisitions is met.  In addition, the Landsat 7 system will be capable of transmitting data in real-time to other, non-USG* ground stations.   USG ground stations will operate according to the data acquisition priorities defined in this document.  Non-USG stations will receive data upon request and limited by the allocation of spacecraft assets for providing direct transmission data. These direct downlink resources will be scheduled in a balanced and equitable manner consistent with the achievement of the global archive mission goal.    The Landsat 7 operator will develop a standard ground station agreement which each non-USG operator must sign to be authorized to receive Landsat 7 data. This agreement will include conditions such as: provision for acquisition scheduling and availability of the direct downlink; the use of non-USG ground stations as contingency backups or supplements for USG data acquisition; retention of ownership by USG of all unenhanced data from Landsat 7; the reception, archiving and cataloging of remotely received data; the availability of these data; exchange of metadata and image data between the non-USG ground station and the EDC-DAAC; the technical services available to the ground stations; and the fees associated with access to data. The Landsat 7 operator will endeavor to provide all requested coverage with the ETM+ sensor within the coverage circle of authorized ground stations, within the limits of the Landsat 7 system's resources and in accordance with conflict resolution guidelines.    Processing  EDC will generate Level 0R data files, metadata, and browse images for all Landsat 7 data received by  the Landsat 7 Ground Station at EDC.  The EDC-DAAC will  provide access to the Landsat 7 metadata and browse images on a non-discriminatory basis and will generate Level 0R, Level 1R, and Level 1G data products on request (see Attachment for descriptions of the data products) for distribution to Landsat data users.   Data processing beyond the Level 1 products distributed through EDC is the responsibility of  the users and will be accomplished with user-owned capabilities or those available from private sector suppliers.    Archive   EDC will archive, at a minimum, all Landsat 7 Level 0R data files, metadata, and browse images generated at EDC and metadata and browse products provided to EDC by the Landsat 7 non-USG ground stations.    Distribution  Landsat 7, Level 0R, Level 1R and Level 1G data products will be distributed in a timely manner on a non-discriminatory basis, within the technical limitations of the system.  The USG will impose no restrictions on subsequent use, sale, or redistribution of data from Landsat 7.   Should demand for data products exceed the daily capacity at EDC, orders for data will be processed based on the same priorities as data acquisition.   EDC will provide standard services associated with distribution of Landsat 7 data including distribution in defined, standard product format(s). Data will be available on physical media and via electronic transfer.    Pricing  All users will be charged standard prices for the products/services provided. Prices will be reviewed and established by LPM once per year.  It is intent of LPM to distribute Level 0R data for no more than $500 per scene.      * Non-USG"" is defined as the Landsat international ground station (IGS) and other ground stations built and/or operated by government-sponsored organizations, commercial entities, or any combination thereof.       Attachment  Landsat 7 Processing Definitions       Metadata  Descriptive information pertaining to the associated data files or data products.  Information includes location and spatial coverage of the digital image data, acquisition date, associated file content, and data quality.  Metadata are generated for the Level 0R data files and for the Level 0R, 1R, and 1G data products.    Browse Image  Sub-sampled Level 0R digital image of the Earth that can be viewed on a scene basis to quickly assess general ground area coverage, data quality, and the spatial relationships between ground area coverage and cloud coverage.   A browse image provides a coarse spatial resolution image with a reduced data volume to facilitate screening of the archived Landsat 7 data.    Calibration Parameter File  Parameters required to radiometrically and geometrically correct Level 0R digital image data to generate Level 1R or 1G data products.  The parameters are based on calibration of the ETM+ and the Landsat 7 spacecraft.    Level 0R Data File  Level 0R digital image data (see description below); payload correction data from the spacecraft including attitude, ephemeris high frequency jitter data, and ETM+ and spacecraft temperatures; mirror scan correction data; a geolocation table; and internal calibration lamp data.    Level 0R Digital Image Data  Reformatted, raw data acquired by the ETM+ as it views the Earth.  Reformatting for ETM+ includes: 1) reversing the order of the reverse scan data, 2) aligning the staggered detectors, 3) nominal alignment of the forward and reverse scans.

GX000-49-0666641	"LANDSAT 7              BASIC FACTS                                                                                                                                                                Supplying              data users worldwide with low cost, multi-purpose, land remote sensing              data into the next century                     Artist's            rendering and schematic of Landsat 7                                                           In 1992, the US Congress              authorized the procurement, launch and operation of a new Landsat              satellite. This new system, Landsat 7, was launched on April 15, 1999.              It is the latest in a series of Landsat earth observation satellites              dating back to 1972. The twenty-nine year record of data acquired              by the Landsat satellites constitutes the longest continuous record              of the earth's continental surfaces. Preservation of the existing              record and continuation of the Landsat capability were identified              in the law as critical to land surface monitoring and global change              research.                                                  Landsat 7 has a unique              and essential role in the realm of earth observing satellites in orbit.              No other earth observing system matches Landsat's combination of synoptic              coverage, high spatial resolution, spectral range and radiometric              calibration. In addition, the Landsat Program is committed to provide              Landsat digital data to the user community in greater quantities,              more quickly and at lower cost than at any previous time in the history              of the program.                                                  The earth              observing instrument on Landsat 7, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus              (ETM+), replicates the capabilities of the highly successful Thematic              Mapper instruments on Landsats 4 and 5*. The ETM+ also includes new              features that make it a more versatile and efficient instrument for              global change studies, land cover monitoring and assessment, and large              area mapping than its design forebears. The primary new features on              Landsat 7 are:                                                    a panchromatic                band with 15m spatial resolution                                          on board,                full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration                                          a thermal                IR channel with 60m spatial resolution                                                                                                 Landsat 7 and            ETM+ Characteristics:                                                       Band                  Number                 Spectral                  Range (microns)                 Ground                  Resolution (m)                                              1                 .45                  to .515                 30                                              2                 .525                  to .605                 30                                              3                 .63                  to .690                 30                                              4                 .75                  to .90                 30                                              5                 1.55                  to 1.75                 30                                              6                 10.40                  to 12.5                 60                                              7                 2.09                  to 2.35                 30                                              Pan                 .52                  to .90                 15                                                                                                      Swath                  width:                 185                  kilometers                                              Repeat                  coverage interval:                 16                  days (233 orbits)                                              Altitude:                 705                  kilometers                                              Quantization:                 Best                  8 of 9 bits                                              On-board                  data storage:                 ~375                  Gb (solid state)                                              Inclination:                 Sun-synchronous,                  98.2 degrees                                              Equatorial                  crossing:                 Descending                  node; 10:00am +/- 15 min.

The primary receiving station is                located at the US Geological Survey's (USGS) EROS Data Center (EDC)                in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Substantially cloud- free, land and                coastal scenes are acquired by EDC through real-time downlink, and                by playback from an on-board, solid state, recording device. The                capacities of the satellite, instrument and ground system are sufficient                to allow for continuous acquisition of all substantially cloud free                scenes at the primary receiving station. In addition, a world-wide                network of receiving stations receive real-time, direct downlink                of image data via X-band. Each station can receive data only for                that part of the ETM+ ground track where the satellite is in sight                of the receiving station.                                                                 The Landsat 7 system insures              continuity of Thematic Mapper type data into the next century. These              data are made available to all users through EDC at the cost of fulfilling              user requests. Browse data (a lower resolution image for determining              image location, quality and information content) and metadata (descriptive              information on the image) are available, on-line, to users within              24 hours of acquisition of the image by the primary ground station.              EDC processes all Landsat 7 data received to ""Level 0R"" ( i.e. corrected              for scan direction and band alignment but without radiometric or geometric              correction) and archives the data in that format. A systematically              corrected product (Level 1G) is generated and distributed to users              on request. The user has the option of performing further processing              on the data on user-operated digital processing equipment or by a              commercial, value added firm.                                     The Landsat            7 spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.            The ETM+ instrument is a product of Hughes Santa Barbara Remote Sensing.            Construction of both was managed through contracts between the manufacturers            and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.                                       The Landsat Program, as              defined by Congress in 1992 and amended by Presidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3              in May, 1994, was managed cooperatively by the National Aeronautics              and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric              Administration (NOAA), and the USGS. NASA was responsibility for construction              of the spacecraft and instrument. The Landsat Program is part of the              NASA's global change initiative - the Earth Observing System, administered              by the NASA Office of Mission to Planet Earth. NOAA no longer participates              in the Landsat 7 program. Landsat 7 is now operated by USGS. Data              processing, archiving and distribution is performed by USGS. These              functions will be executed in coordination with the EDC Distributed              Active Archive Center (EDC DAAC) of NASA's Earth Observing System              Data and Information System (EOSDIS) at EDC.                       *The ETM+            is similar to the ETM instrument on Landsat 6. Landsat 6 was launched            in October 1993, but failed to obtain orbit.

Landsat 7 takes pictures of the earth          and sends the data to the ground stations around the          world.            Top^                 What is Landsat 7?           In 1992, the U.S. Congress authorized                            the procurement, launch and operation of a new Landsat                            satellite. This new system, Landsat 7, was launched                            in April, 1999. It is latest in a series of earth observation                            satellites dating back to 1972. The thirty year record                            of data acquired by the Landsat satellites constitutes                            the longest continuous record of the earth's continental                            surfaces. Preservation of the existing record and continuation                            of the Landsat capability were identified in the law                            as critical to land surface monitoring and global change                            research. Landsat 7 has a unique and essential role                            in the realm of earth observing satellites in orbit.                            No other system matches Landsat's combination of synoptic                            coverage, high spatial resolution, spectral range and                            radiometric calibration. In addition, the Landsat Project                            is committed to providing Landsat digital data to the                            user community in greater quantities, more quickly and                            at lower cost than at any previous time in the history                            of the Project. The earth observing instrument on Landsat                            7, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), replicates                            the capabilities of the highly successful Thematic Mapper                            instruments on Landsat 4 and 5*. The ETM+ also includes                            new features that make it a more versatile and efficient                            instrument for global change studies, land cover monitoring                            and assessment, and large area mapping than its design                            forebears. The primary new features on Landsat 7 are:                                                       a panchromatic band with 15m spatial resolution                          on board, full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration                          a thermal IR channel with 60m spatial resolution                                              Top^                                 Landsat 7 and ETM+ Characteristics:                                                                                          Band Number             Spectral Range (microns)             Ground Resolution (m)                                                 1                         .45 to .515             30                                                 2                         .525 to .605             30                                                 3                         .63 to .690             30                                                 4                         .75 to .90             30                                                 5                         1.55 to 1.75             30                                                 6                         10.40 to 12.5             60                                                 7                         2.09 to 2.35             30                                                 Pan                         .52 to .90             15                                                     Swath width:         185 kilometers                     Repeat coverage         interval:         16 days (233 orbits)                     Altitude:         705 kilometers                     Quantization:         Best 8 of 9 bits                     On-board data storage:         ~375 Gb (solid state)                     Inclination:         Sun-synchronous, 98.2 degrees                     Equatorial crossing:         Descending node; 10:00am +/- 15min.                     Launch vehicle:         Delta II                     Launch date:         April 1999                             The instrument is supported by a ground network that         receives ETM+ data via X-band direct downlink only         at a data rate of 150 Mbps. The primary receiving         station at the US Geological Survey's (USGS)  EROS         Data Center (EDC)  in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.         Substantially cloud- free, land and coastal scenes         will be acquired by EDC through real-time downlink,         and by playback from an on-board, solid state, recording         device. The capacities of the satellite, instrument         and ground system are sufficient to allow for continuous         acquisition of all substantially cloud free scenes         at the primary receiving station. In addition, a world-wide         network of receiving stations is able to receive real-time,         direct downlink of image data via X-band. Each station         is able to receive data only for that part of the         ETM+ ground track where the satellite is in sight         of the receiving station.           The Landsat 7 systeminsures continuity of Thematic         Mapper type data into the next centuries. These data         are made available to all users through EDC at the         cost of fulfilling user requests. Browse data (a lower         resolution image for determining image location, quality         and information content) and metadata (descriptive         information on the image) will be available, on-line,         to users within 24 hours of acquisition of the image         by the primary ground station. EDC will process all         Landsat 7 data received to  ""Level         0R""  ( i.e. corrected for scan direction         and band alignment but without radiometric or geometric         correction) and archive the data in that format. A         systematically corrected product  (Level         1G)  will be generated and distributed to users         on request. The user hasthe option of performing further         processing on the data on user-operated digital processing         equipment or by a commercial, value added firm.           The Landsat 7 spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The ETM+ instrument is a product of Hughes Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. Construction of both is managed through contracts between the manufacturers and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.          The Landsat Project, as defined by Congress in 1992                              and amended by Presidential Decision Directive/NSTC-3                              in May, 1994, is managed cooperatively by the National                              Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National                              Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and                              the USGS. Responsibility for construction of the spacecraft                              and instrument lied with NASA. The Landsat Project                              is part of the NASA's global change initiative - the                              Earth Observing System, administered by the NASA Office                              of Mission to Planet Earth. Landsat 7 will be operated                              by NOAA. Data processing, archiving and distribution                              will be performed by USGS with direction from NOAA.                              These functions are executed in coordination with                              the EDC Distributed Active Archive Center  (LP                              DAAC)  of NASA's Earth Observing System Data                              and Information System (EOSDIS) at EDC.                             *The ETM+ is similar to the ETM instrument on Landsat 6. Landsat 6 was launched in October, 1993, but failed to obtain orbit.           Top^              When is Landsat 7 going over my house?          An orbit is completed approximately          every 99 minutes allowing the spacecraft to achieve          over 14 orbits a day. Therefore, total coverage of the          Earth occurs in 16 days. The descending orbit from north          to south crosses the equator between 10:00 and 10:15          (local time) on each pass.         Top^            Can an acquisition request be made for a specific geographic area and temporal period?                           Data acquisition requests will not be available to the                       public due to the robust nature of the Landsat 7 Long Term                       Acquisition Plan (LTAP). The LTAP was derived from                       recommendations put forth by the scientific community. The                       purpose of the plan is to optimize the use of the Enhanced                       Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) to create a global archive of the                       processes on the planet's land surfaces. The LTAP takes                       into account the calibration plan, planned satellite                       maneuvers, and international imaging needs.                        The Mission Operation Center (MOC)                       schedules a 48-hour set of activities based on a number of                       criteria, including global refresh requirements, request                       priority, solid state recorder or other resource                       availability, and cloud cover predictions. After the                       Flight Operations Team (FOT) has iterated through the                       scheduling function and resolved all conflicts, the MOC                       will pass the 48-hour schedule to the load generation                       function for final compilation.

GX000-59-5124954	[GOES] [Landsat MSS] [Landsat TM] [WiFS]                 WiFS Images  (1996 to present):             General Comments      The Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) is on-board the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite 1C (IRS-1C) launched in 1996. It collects images during mid-morning (about 10:30 AM) with a spatial resolution of about 200 meters in both a red and near-infrared spectral band. The temporal resolution/revisit time frame is five days, which is an improvement over the two weeks of the Landsat systems, but still not as frequent as that of the GOES (every 15-30 minutes) or SeaWiFS (once per day). A major advantage of this data set is that it fills in the spatial resolution gap between the Landsat TM and MSS (30 and 75 meters, respectively) and the GOES and SeaWiFS (1 km) data sets. This, combined with the fact that our eolian erosion vulnerability image mapping algorithm uses the red and near-infrared bands (the two bands collected by WiFS), allows excellent regional image maps to be made using these data. The five day temporal resolution makes them better than the Landsat MSS and TM data for possible imaging of active dust storms, but still not acceptable for operational monitoring and detection of active dust storms.

The instrument provided nearly continuous coverage from July 1972 to October 1992, with an 18-day repeat cycle for Landsats 1-3 and a 16-day repeat cycle for Landsats 4-5.   MSS data generally consists of four spectral bands which include the visible green, visible red, and near-infrared wavelengths, although the specific  band designations  were changed from Landsats 1-3 to Landsats 4-5. MSS data from Landsat 3 will also include a fifth band in the thermal infrared. The resolution for all bands is 79 meters, and the approximate scene size will be 185 x 170 kilometers (115 x 106 miles).      The following level of correction is available to the general public:    Systematic Correction   includes both radiometric and geometric correction. The scene will be rotated and aligned to a user-defined map projection.    The following levels of correction are available to  Approved U.S. Government and its Affiliated Users (USGAU)  only:  Precision Correction   includes radiometric and geometric correction, as well as the use of ground control points (GCPs) to improve accuracy. For locations outside the U.S., the availability of a precision-corrected product  will depend upon the availability of local GCPs.   Terrain Correction   includes radiometric, geometric, and precision correction, as well as the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) to correct parallax error due to local terrain elevation. For locations outside the U.S., the availability of a terrain-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local ground control points (GCPs), as well as the resolution of the best available DEM.

The resulting EarthSat Geocover thematic mapper (TM) data set contains orthorectified TM data from the Landsat-4 and -5 satellites. Only the Landsat images that most closely met a specific set of criteria, including acquisition date, cloud percentage, data quality parameters, and best available phenology, were considered for the collection.     Approximately 8,500 Landsat TM images were selected. The acquisition dates of these images were relative to a 1990 acquisition baseline, and the images were either cloud-free or contained minimal cloud cover. In addition, only TM images with a high quality ranking in regards to the possible presence of errors such as missing scans or saturated bands were selected. It was important to collect data during periods of peak greenness so NASA adopted an approach for image selection that was based upon global 1-kilometer Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data. It was sometimes difficult for NASA to obtain clear images during time frames of peak greenness, resulting in some image substitution from other times of the year.     The Landsat data were orthorectified, using geodetic and elevation control data to correct for positional accuracy and relief displacement. Large blocks of Landsat data were adjusted through a patented procedure that uses pixel correlation to acquire tie-points within the overlap area between adjacent Landsat images. Ground control points are fixed, and images are projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator map projection, using the World Geodetic System 1984 datum. All bands are individually resampled, using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The result is a final product with a Root Mean Square Error of better than 50 meters in positional accuracy.     The Landsat TM data were compiled through a NASA contract with Earth Satellite Corporation, Rockville, Maryland, and are part of NASA's Scientific Data Purchase program.

The sensor has provided continuous coverage since July 1999, with a 16-day repeat cycle.  The ETM+ instrument provides image data from eight spectral bands ( band designations ). The spatial resolution is 30 meters for the visible and near-infrared (bands 1-5 and 7). Resolution for the panchromatic (band 8) is 15 meters, and the thermal infrared (band 6) is 60 meters. The approximate scene size is 170 x 183 kilometers (106 x 115 miles).     The following levels of correction are available to the general public ( detailed comparison ):  Raw Uncorrected (Level 0Rp)  has no radiometric or geometric correction applied. Scan lines are reversed and nominally aligned. Image data is provided in 8-bit (DN) values.    Radiometric Correction (Level 1R)  includes radiometric correction, but no geometric correction. Scan lines are reversed and nominally aligned. Image data is provided in 16-bit (radiance) values.    Systematic Correction (Level 1G)   includes both radiometric and geometric correction. Image data is provided in rescaled 8-bit (DN) values. The scene will be rotated, aligned, and georeferenced to a user-defined map projection. Geometric accuracy of the systematically corrected product should be within 250 meters (1 sigma) for low-relief areas at sea level.      The following levels of correction are available to  approved USGS researchers  only:  Precision Correction (Level 1P)  includes radiometric and geometric correction, as well as the use of ground control points (GCPs) to improve accuracy. For locations outside the U.S., accuracy of the precision-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local GCPs.     Terrain Correction (Level 1T)  includes radiometric, geometric, and precision correction, as well as the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) to correct parallax error due to local topographic relief. For locations outside the U.S., the accuracy of the terrain-corrected product will depend upon the availability of local ground control points (GCPs), as well as the resolution of the best available DEM.      Raw and radiometrically corrected data will have no projection or datum applied.

The current SLC-off product release includes all image data acquired by Landsat 7 in SLC-off mode from July 14, 2003 to present (excluding a 2-week period from 9/3/03 to 9/17/03).   The initial SLC-off data products include Level 0Rp, Level 1R, and Level 1G data, and are distributed as standard Landsat 7 single scene (WRS-2) and multi-scene products. SLC-off Level 1R and Level 1G products are currently being processed by the Level 1 Product Generation System ( LPGS ) only. The release schedule for future data products (e.g. Level 1G, Level 1P, and Level 1T) processed through the National Land Archive Production System ( NLAPS ) is still being determined.     An SLC-off image will contain alternating bands of missing data along the scene edge, which gradually diminish in width toward the middle of the scene. The scene center will be very similar in quality to previous Landsat 7 image data. For detailed information and product samples, please visit the Landsat 7  SLC-off Data Products  webpage.   The costs for initial SLC-off products are the same as for Landsat 7 data collected prior to the SLC anomaly. As required by public law, the USGS must charge for data products according to the cost of fulfilling user requests.

Back to Top      Search & Order    NOTE:  All Landsat 7 image data acquired from July 14, 2003 (20:32:40 GMT) to present were collected in  SLC-off mode . The SLC-off data can be searched and ordered via the  EOS Data Gateway . Image data acquired from 5/31/03 (21:42:35 GMT) to 7/14/03 (20:32:40 GMT) and from 9/3/03 (01:32:15 GMT) to 9/17/03 (06:22:27 GMT) are not available for search and order.      There are two separate processing systems used to generate USGS Landsat 7 products. All orders placed through the EOS Data Gateway will be processed by the Level 1 Product Generation System (LPGS), whereas all orders placed through Earth Explorer or GloVis will be processed by the National Land Archive Production System (NLAPS). Overall, the products generated by the LPGS and NLAPS systems are very similar, but users should be aware that several differences exist. For a detailed description of these differences, see the  LPGS vs. NLAPS Comparison .     The appropriate processing system (and ordering options) for Landsat 7 data will depend upon the level of correction desired:                 Level of Correction         Processing System   Search and Order      Raw Uncorrected (Level 0Rp)    n/a      EOS Data Gateway          Earth Explorer          GloVis                   Radiometric Correction (Level 1R )    LPGS       EOS Data Gateway                   Systematic Correction (Level 1G)   NLAPS        Earth Explorer         GloVis     LPGS        EOS Data Gateway                Precision Correction (Level 2A)    NLAPS       contact us  (USGS researchers only)                Terrain Correction (Level 2B)     NLAPS       contact us  (USGS researchers only)               If searching by the WRS (Worldwide Reference System) of paths and rows, all Landsat 7 ETM+ data is referenced to the  WRS-2  scheme.   Recently acquired scenes with direct downlink to USGS EDC will generally become available for search and order within 6-24 hours of scene acquisition.    Locations outside the U.S.:  For international locations, there may be Landsat 7 scenes that were  collected by the instrument but the scenes are not archived or distributed by the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC).  These scenes may be available from other  International Ground Stations . Note that these data would not be a product of the USGS EDC and therefore the prices, available formats, and/or processing options may vary according to the data provider.   Back to Top       Image Previews   All Landsat 7 scenes should be previewed prior to purchase.  Browse images of all available scenes may be viewed by searching on either  Earth Explorer  or the  EOS Data Gateway . For an alternative ""quick and easy"" browse image viewer (daytime acquisitions only), see  GloVis .   Each Landsat 7 browse image is a subsampled JPEG of the raw scene data.  The browse image will be displayed as a 5,4,3 (RGB) composite with a 2% linear color stretch, based on individual scene content.         Back to Top     Sample Data   Sample data consisting of selected Landsat 7 scenes may be purchased at a reduced price of $32 per scene, plus  $5 handling charge . Several different locations, formats, and levels of correction are available.

The 16-day ground coverage            cycle for Landsats 4-7 is accomplished in 233 orbits. Thus, the WRS            is made up of 233 paths numbered 001 to 233, east to west, with Path            001 crossing the equator at 64.60 degrees west longitude.              Every 16 days, a Landsat            satellite returns to its starting point and repeats the cycle. Working            together, Landsats 5 and 7 will offer repeat coverage of any location            every eight days. At the equator, the ground track separation is 172            km, with a 7.6 percent overlap. This overlap gradually increases as            the satellites approach the poles, reaching 54 percent at 60ê latitude.                                     Multi-Spectral Scanner            (MSS)               The Multispectral Scanner            (MSS) sensors were line scanning devices observing the Earth perpendicular            to the orbital track. The cross-track scanning was accomplished by an            oscillating mirror; six lines were scanned simultaneously in each of            the four spectral bands for each mirror sweep. The forward motion of            the satellite provided the along-track scan line progression.                       The first five Landsats carried            the MSS sensor which responded to Earth-reflected sunlight in four spectral            bands. Landsat 3 carried an MSS sensor with an additional band, designated            band 8, that responded to thermal (heat) infrared radiation.                       An MSS scene had an Instantaneous            Field Of View (IFOV) of 68 meters in the cross-track direction by 83            meters in the along-track direction (223.0 by 272.3 feet respectively).            To understand this concept consider a ground scene composed of a single            83 by 83 meter area. The scan monitor sensor ensures that the cross-track            optical scan is 185 km at nominal altitude regardless of mirror scan            nonlinearity or other perturbations of mirror velocity.              Cross- track image velocity            was nominally 6.82 meters per microsecond. After 9.958 microseconds,            the 83 by 83 meter image has moved 67.9 meters. The sample taken at            this instant represented 15 meters of previous information and 68 meters            of new information.              Therefore, the effective            IFOV of the MSS detector in the cross-track direction was considered            to be 68 meters which corresponds to a nominal picture element (pixel)            ground area of 68 by 83 meters at the satellite nadir point. Using the            effective IFOV in area calculation eliminates the overlap in area between            adjacent pixels.

TM data are sensed in seven spectral bands simultaneously.            Band 6 senses thermal (heat) infrared radiation. Landsat can only acquire            night scenes in band 6. A TM scene has an Instantaneous Field Of View            (IFOV) of 30 square meters in bands 1-5 and 7 while band 6 has an IFOV            of 120 square meters on the ground.

This new system, Landsat 7, will have a unique and essential role in            the realm of Earth observing satellites in orbit by the end of this            decade. No other system will match Landsat 7's combination of synoptic            coverage, high spatial resolution, spectral range and radiometric calibration.            In addition, the Landsat Program is committed to provide Landsat digital            data to the user community in greater quantities, more quickly and at            lower cost than at any previous time in the history of the program.                         The earth observing instrument            on Landsat 7, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), replicates the            capabilities of the highly successful Thematic Mapper instruments on            Landsats 4 and 5*. The ETM+ also includes new features that make it            a more versatile and efficient instrument for global change studies,            land cover monitoring and assessment, and large area mapping than its            design forebears.              The primary new features            on Landsat 7 are:                                         a panchromatic                band with 15m spatial resolution                                           on board,                full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration                                           a thermal                IR channel with 60m spatial resolution                                    The ETM+ instrument is a            fixed ""whisk-broom"", eight-band, multispectral scanning radiometer capable            of providing high-resolution imaging information of the Earth's surface.            It detects spectrally-filtered radiation in VNIR, SWIR, LWIR and panchromatic            bands from the sun-lit Earth in a 183 km wide swath when orbiting at            an altitude of 705 km.              On board solar calibration            and payload correction data allows the ground to radiometrically correct            the data to an absolute accuracy of 5% and to geometric register a scene            to within 250 meters. Nominal ground sample distances (""pixel"" sizes)            are 15 meters in the panchromatic band, 30 meters in the VNIR and SWIR            bands and 60 meters in the LWIR band.              Landsat 7 will collect data            in accordance with the World Wide Reference System, which has catalogued            the world's land mass into 57,784 scenes, each 183 km wide by 170 km            long. The ETM+ will produce approximately 3.8 gigabits of data for each            scene. An ETM+ scene will have an Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV)            of 30 square meters in bands 1-5 and 7 while band 6 will have an IFOV            of 60 square meters on the ground and the new band 8 an IFOV of 15 square            meters.

The primary receiving station will            be at the US Geological Survey's (USGS)  EROS Data Center (EDC)             in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Substantially cloud- free, land and coastal            scenes will be acquired by EDC through real-time downlink, and by playback            from an on-board, solid state, recording device. The capacities of the            satellite, instrument and ground system will be sufficient to allow            for continuous acquisition of all substantially cloud free scenes at            the primary receiving station. In addition, a world-wide network of            receiving stations will be able to receive real-time, direct downlink            of image data via X-band. Each station will be able to receive data            only for that part of the ETM+ ground track where the satellite is in            sight of the receiving station.               The Landsat 7 system will            insure continuity of Thematic Mapper type data into the next century.            These data will be made available to all users through EDC at the cost            of fulfilling user requests. Browse data (a lower resolution image for            determining image location, quality and information content) and metadata            (descriptive information on the image) will be available, on-line, to            users within 24 hours of acquisition of the image by the primary ground            station. EDC will process all Landsat 7 data received to ""Level 0R""            ( i.e. corrected for scan direction and band alignment but without radiometric            or geometric correction) and archive the data in that format. A systematically            corrected product,""Level 1G"", will be generated and distributed to users            on request. The user will have the option of performing further processing            on the data on user-operated digital processing equipment or by a commercial,            value added firm.               The Landsat 7 spacecraft            was built by Lockheed Martin in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The ETM+            instrument is a product of Hughes Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. Construction            of both was managed through contracts between the manufacturers and            the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.

GX001-31-11292137	"Landsat 7 Data Policy           October 31, 1994           Revised:            September 19, 1997                                               Introduction            Section 105 of Public Law (P.L.)102-555, The Land Remote Sensing Policy            Act of 1992, states, ""The Landsat Program Management (LPM), in consultation            with other appropriate United States Government agencies, shall develop            a data policy for Landsat 7..."". The law also identifies goals for the            policy. This document, in accordance with the law, establishes a data            policy for Landsat 7 that covers the acquisition, processing, archival,            distribution and pricing policy for Landsat 7 data. Roles and responsibilities            for Landsat 7 system development and operations are contained in the            Management Plan for the Landsat Program.               As required by P.L. 102-555,            this Data Policy is designed to achieve the following:                                                    Ensure                that unenhanced data are available to all users at the cost of fulfilling                user requests;                                          Ensure                timely and dependable delivery of unenhanced data to the full spectrum                of civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign users and                the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive (NSLRSDA);                                                         Ensure                that the United States retains ownership of all unenhanced data                generated by Landsat 7;                                          Support                the development of the commercial market for remote sensing data;                                                         Ensure                that the provision of commercial value-added services based on remote                sensing data remains exclusively the function of the private sector;                and                                          To the                extent possible, ensure that the data distribution system for Landsat                7 is compatible with the Earth Observing System Data and Information                System (EOSDIS).                                     The Landsat 7 system will            comprise a spacecraft carrying an Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)            instrument and a ground segment consisting of mission operations, data            capture, ground processing, data archiving, and data product distribution            elements. The ETM+ is a nadir-pointing, eight spectral band instrument            designed to provide data continuity with the Thematic Mapper instruments            on Landsats 4 and 5.                Acquisition            Data acquisition by the ETM+ on Landsat 7 will be directed by the mission            goal of acquiring and updating periodically a global archive of daytime,            substantially cloud-free images of land areas. In addition to the periodic            global archive acquisitions, Landsat 7 will acquire every daytime scene            on every pass over the United States. However, the Landsat operator            will modify the acquisition schedule for the global archive mission            and the standing order for scenes of the United States to accommodate            time-critical observations and other requests based on the following            order of priorities:                                         Spacecraft                and instrument health and safety                                           Time                critical acquisitions related to national security, natural disasters                and environmental emergencies                                           Time                critical acquisitions to support large campaigns and other key US                Government (USG) programs                                           Acquisitions                critical to the global archive mission                                           Acquisition                requests from individuals and commercial entities                                     Conflicts in the acquisition            schedule will be resolved by the Landsat operator according to the priorities            listed above and policy guidelines established by the Landsat Coordinating            Group (LCG) acting on behalf of Landsat Program Management.                        Non-time critical requests            for acquisitions will be received by the EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive            Center (DAAC) at the US Geological Survey's EROS Data Center (EDC) in            Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Requests for time critical acquisitions will            be received directly by the Landsat operator.               The primary USG ground station            will be located at EDC. The ground station will have the capability            to capture both real-time and recorded data via direct transmission            from Landsat 7. Secondary USG ground stations for Landsat 7 will be            located in the Fairbanks, Alaska area and Svalbard, Norway. The secondary            station(s) will serve as backup for the primary station and ensure that            the requirement for scene acquisitions is met. In addition, the Landsat            7 system will be capable of transmitting data in real-time to other,            non-USG* ground stations.               USG ground stations will            operate according to the data acquisition priorities defined in this            document. Non-USG stations will receive data upon request and limited            by the allocation of spacecraft assets for providing direct transmission            data. These direct downlink resources will be scheduled in a balanced            and equitable manner consistent with the achievement of the global archive            mission goal.               The Landsat 7 operator will            develop a standard ground station agreement which each non-USG operator            must sign to be authorized to receive Landsat 7 data. This agreement            will include conditions such as: provision for acquisition scheduling            and availability of the direct downlink; the use of non-USG ground stations            as contingency backups or supplements for USG data acquisition; retention            of ownership by USG of all unenhanced data from Landsat 7; the reception,            archiving and cataloging of remotely received data; the availability            of these data; exchange of metadata and image data between the non-USG            ground station and the EDC-DAAC; the technical services available to            the ground stations; and the fees associated with access to data. The            Landsat 7 operator will endeavor to provide all requested coverage with            the ETM+ sensor within the coverage circle of authorized ground stations,            within the limits of the Landsat 7 system's resources and in accordance            with conflict resolution guidelines.                Processing            EDC will generate Level 0R data files, metadata, and browse images for            all Landsat 7 data received by the Landsat 7 Ground Station at EDC.            The EDC-DAAC will provide access to the Landsat 7 metadata and browse            images on a non-discriminatory basis and will generate Level 0R, Level            1R, and Level 1G data products on request (see Attachment for descriptions            of the data products) for distribution to Landsat data users.                        Data processing beyond the            Level 1 products distributed through EDC is the responsibility of the            users and will be accomplished with user-owned capabilities or those            available from private sector suppliers.                Archive            EDC will archive, at a minimum, all Landsat 7 Level 0R data files, metadata,            and browse images generated at EDC and metadata and browse products            provided to EDC by the Landsat 7 non-USG ground stations.                Distribution            Landsat 7, Level 0R, Level 1R and Level 1G data products will be distributed            in a timely manner on a non-discriminatory basis, within the technical            limitations of the system. The USG will impose no restrictions on subsequent            use, sale, or redistribution of data from Landsat 7.               Should demand for data products            exceed the daily capacity at EDC, orders for data will be processed            based on the same priorities as data acquisition.               EDC will provide standard            services associated with distribution of Landsat 7 data including distribution            in defined, standard product format(s). Data will be available on physical            media and via electronic transfer.                Pricing            All users will be charged standard prices for the products/services            provided. Prices will be reviewed and established by LPM once per year.            It is intent of LPM to distribute Level 0R data for no more than $500            per scene.                                                     * Non-USG""            is defined as the Landsat international ground station (IGS) and other            ground stations built and/or operated by government-sponsored organizations,            commercial entities, or any combination thereof.                                     Attachment            Landsat 7 Processing Definitions                                               Metadata            Descriptive information pertaining to the associated data files or data            products. Information includes location and spatial coverage of the            digital image data, acquisition date, associated file content, and data            quality.

The overall purpose of the IAS geometric algorithms is to use Earth ellipsoid          and terrain surface information in conjunction with spacecraft ephemeris          and attitude data, and knowledge of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus          (ETM+) instrument and Landsat 7 satellite geometry to relate locations          in ETM+ image space (band, scan, detector, sample) to geodetic object          space (latitude, longitude, and height). These algorithms are used for          purposes of creating accurate Level 1 output products, characterizing          the ETM+ absolute and relative geometric accuracy, and deriving improved          estimates of geometric calibration parameters such as the sensor to spacecraft          alignment.                                          10.2              Level 1 Algorithms               Menu                                          The Level 1 processing algorithms include:          1. Payload Correction Data (PCD) processing          2. Mirror Scan Correction Data (MSCD) processing          3. ETM+/Landsat 7 sensor/platform geometric model creation          4. sensor line of sight generation and projection          5. output space/input space correction grid generation          6. image resampling          7. geometric model precision correction using ground control          8. terrain correction.         The diagrams that follow describe the high-level processing flows for          the IAS Level 1 processing algorithms.  Figure          10.1  describes the process involved in initialization and creation          of the Landsat 7 geometry model.  Figure          10.2  shows the process of creating a geometric correction grid and          the application of that grid in the resampling process.  Figure          10.3  describes the process of refining the Landsat 7 geometry model          with ground control, resulting in a precision geometry model.  Figure          10.4  again describes the creation of a geometric correction grid (this          time precision), and resampling with terrain correction.         Detailed algorithm descriptions for each of main process boxes in these          diagrams can be found in the Landsat 7 Image Assessment System (IAS) Geometric          Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document ( PDF ).

Some of these algorithms          also require additional ancillary input data sets. These include:                   1. Precise ephemeris from the Flight Dynamics Facility - used          to minimize ephemeris error when performing sensor to spacecraft alignment          calibration.           2. Ground control/reference images for geometric test sites - used            in precision correction, geodetic accuracy assessment, and geometric            calibration algorithms.           3.

GX001-47-2258561	Identification_Information:   Citation:     Citation_Information:       Originator: Mojave Desert Ecosystem Program       Publication_Date: 20010423       Title: Mojave Desert Landsat TM Data       Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: remote-sensing image   Description:     Abstract:       A TM instrument is flown on Landsat 4 and 5, the last two       of the five Landsats. Both satellite's TM radiometers       acquire day and night data which are systematically       corrected during processing. The standard digital data       product is in a band sequential (BSQ) FAST format.       Landsat 4 and 5's TM mechanical scanning radiometers       operate in 7 channels of the electromagnetic spectrum       (band 1 spectral range is .45-.52 micometers, band 2 is       .52-.60, band 3 is .63-.69, band 4 is .76-.90, band 5 is       1.55-1.75, band 6 is 10.40-12.50, and band 7 is 2.08-2.35).       Six reflective bands are blue, green, red, and near infrared.       Two shortwave infrared bands and a band measuring       emitted energy 10.4 to 12.5 micrometers and has 120       meter ground resolution.     Purpose:       To provide comprehensive TM data of the Mojave       Desert area for use in a variety of applications.

Security_Information:     Security_Handling_Description: None     Security_Classification: Unclassified     Security_Classification_System: Unknown Data_Quality_Information:   Attribute_Accuracy:     Attribute_Accuracy_Report:       The identification of features is provided by the distinct electromagnetic energy it emits, reflects, or otherwise transmits. This is called the spectral signature. Other signatures are tone (lightnes or darkness), texture (surface roughness or smoothness), pattern, shadow, shape and size are as important.Thus, through the use of thematic mapper, such elements as water features, soils, and vegetation can be identified and distinguished from each other.       Landsats 4 and 5 carry both the MSS and the thematic mapper (TM) sensors; however, routine collection of MSS data was terminated in late 1992. They orbit at an altitude of 705 km and provide a 16-day, 233-orbit cycle with a swath overlap that varies from 7 percent at the Equator to nearly 84 percent at 81 north or south latitude. These satellites were also designed and operated to collect data over a 185 km swath. The MSS sensors aboard Landsats 4 and 5 are identical to the ones that were carried on Landsats 1 and 2. The MSS and TM sensors primarily detect reflected radiation from the Earth surface in the visible and near-infrared (IR) wavelengths, but the TM sensor provides more radiometric information than the MSS sensor. The wavelength range for the TM sensor is from the visible (blue), through the mid-IR, into the thermal-IR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sixteen detectors for the visible and mid-IR wavelength bands in the TM sensor provide 16 scan lines on each active scan. Four detectors for the thermal-IR band provide four scan lines on each active scan. The TM sensor has a spatial resolution of 30 m for the visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths and a spatial resolution of 120 m for the thermal-IR band.    Logical_Consistency_Report: All of the Landsats have been in sun-synchronous orbits with equatorial crossing times ranging from 8:30 a.m. for Landsat 1, 9 a.m. for Landsat 2, to 9:45 a.m. for Landsat 5. The Landsat system provides for global data between 81 degrees north latitude and 81 degrees south latitude.   Completeness_Report:     The Landsat platforms operate from a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit imaging the same 185 km (115 miles) ground swath every 16 days. Thematic mapper (TM) data are received directly from Landsats 4 and 5 by a network of 16 worldwide ground stations. The United States ground station in Norman, Oklahoma, receives TM downlinks daily, and records them on high density tapes (HDTS). These HDTs are then sent to Space Imaging EOSAT's Image Processing Facility (IDPF) located in Lanham, Maryland. Also, data are transmitted via a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) to its ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico, and then relayed via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT) to the Space Imaging EOSAT data processing facility in Norman, Oklahoma.     The TDRS System (TDRSS) satellites are in geosynchronous orbits. This configuration allowed the acquisition of MSS data for nearly all of the Earth's surface, except for an area between 50 degrees north and 67 degrees east by 50 degrees south and 82 degrees east. That area may be covered in part by data recorders at the Thailand and India ground stations.    Positional_Accuracy:     Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:       Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:         The thematic mapper (TM) is an advanced, multispectral scanning, Earth resources sensor designed to achieve higher image resolution, sharper spectral separation, improved geometric fidelity, and greater radiometric accuracy and resolution than the MSS sensor. TM data are scanned simultaneously in seven spectral bands. Band 6 scans thermal (heat) infrared radiation.

They orbit at an altitude of 705 km and provide a 16-day, 233-orbit cycle with a swath overlap that varies from 7 percent at the Equator to nearly 84 percent at 81 north or south latitude. These satellites were also designed and operated to collect data over a 185 km swath. The MSS sensors aboard Landsats 4 and 5 are identical to the ones that were carried on Landsats 1 and 2. The MSS and TM sensors primarily detect reflected radiation from the Earth surface in the visible and IR wavelengths, but the TM sensor provides more radiometric information than the MSS sensor. The wavelength range for the TM sensor is from the visible (blue), through the mid-IR, into the thermal-IR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sixteen detectors for the visible and mid-IR wavelength bands in the TM sensor provide 16 scan lines on each active scan. Four detectors for the thermal-IR band provide four scan lines on each active scan. The TM sensor has a spatial resolution of 30 meters for the visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths and a spatial resolution of 120 meters for the thermal-IR band. Spatial_Data_Organization_Information:   Indirect_Spatial_Reference:     A Landsat 4 and 5 TM scene has an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 30 square meters in bands 1 through 5 and band 7, band 6 has an IFOV of 120 square meters on the ground.

The characteristics of the MSS and TM bands were selected to maximize their capabilities for detecting and monitoring different types of Earth resources. For example, TM band 2 can detect green reflectance from healthy vegetation, and band 3 of TM is designed for detecting chlorophyll absorption in vegetation. TM band 4 is ideal for near-IR reflectance peaks in healthy green vegetation and for detecting water-land interfaces. TM band 1 can penetrate water for bathymetric mapping along coastal areas and is useful for soil-vegetation differentiation and for distinguishing forest types. The two mid-IR red bands on TM (bands 5 and 7) are useful for vegetation and soil moisture studies, and discriminating between rock and mineral types. The thermal-IR band on TM (band 6) is designed to assist in thermal mapping, and for soil moisture and vegetation studies.       Typically, TM Bands 4, 3, and 2 can be combined to make false-color composite images where band 4 represents red, band 3, green, and band 2, blue. This band combination makes vegetation appear as shades of red, brighter reds indicating more vigorously growing vegetation. Soils with no or sparse vegetation will range from white (sands) to greens or browns depending on moisture and organic matter content. Water bodies will appear blue. Deep, clear water will be dark blue to black in color, while sediment-laden or shallow waters will appear lighter in color. Urban areas will appear blue-gray in color. Clouds and snow will be bright white. They are usually distinguishable from each other by the shadows associated with the clouds.

GX001-56-3245219	San Francisco Bay: Change Detection and Mapping       Use of Landsat Thematic Mapper Multitemporal Images to  Detect and Map Changes in the San Francisco Bay Area   Ecosystems within coastal regions are undergoing dramatic changes and are impacted by human activities from economic, land use, and resource development. Habitats for wildlife and fish species in many coastal areas are being threatened by some of these human activities, as well as possible sea-level rise. In addition, biodiversity and wildlife resources in these coastal areas can be altered by changes in global climate. To understand and map important ecosystem parameters, such as suspended sediment loads and surficial changes in wetlands along coastal areas, vegetation types and density, landforms and their changes, as well as urban growth patterns, we must employ our capabilities to detect and map surface variability temporally, spatially, and spectrally. It is critical to have tools, procedures, and data to not only study ecosystems, but to be able to monitor them over time and space as population expands and/or climate changes occur. Satellite multispectral digital image ( Chavez and MacKinnon, 1994 ) data are particularly helpful for monitoring and detecting surface variability. In particular, these satellite data allow an area to be studied from a regional perspective over time. The images shown here are portions of two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital images recorded on September 7, 1984 and September 16, 1993 from an altitude of approximately 700 km (438 miles). Landsat TM images have an approximate 30 meter resolution and cover an area that is about 185 by 185 km (115 by 115 mi). The images shown cover the San Francisco Bay and Delta region and the color composites were generated using Landsat TM spectral bands 2 (green), 4 (near-infrared), and 5 (mid-infrared) as blue, green, and red, respectively. The digital data were processed using the  USGS MIPS software package to correct for both geometric and radiometric distortions and enhance the overall contrast and local detail. These images are part of a set of data being used to study regional changes and help develop tools and procedures to monitor ecosystems. The images were geometrically registered to each other so that the same pixel within both images represents the same location on the ground and they had both radiometric calibration and corrections applied (Chavez, 1989). The City of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge can be seen to the left of center; extreme South Bay is towards the bottom center; San Pablo and Suisun Bays are to the northwest of center; the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers are shown in the north/northeast portion of the image. Highways 101 and 880, along with other main roads, can also be seen in the digital images. Also, note the clouds along the coast in the 1993 image.                   Accessibility Note:  The following image submit buttons lead to a graphical interface that some users may have difficulty using. Please e-mail  webman@TerraWeb.wr.usgs.gov  for assistance.               Landsat TM 1984             Landsat TM 1993             1984 vs 1993 Change Image                  The geometrically registered and radiometrically calibrated multitemporal image pair was used as input to our change-detection procedure to generate digital change images from the visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectral bands (Chavez and MacKinnon, 1994). The change image results for the three spectral bands were then used to make the color composite shown here. The three spectral bands will detect many of the same temporal changes, however, there will be some changes that are detected better in one band versus the others or some changes that will be detected by only one or two of the three spectral bands (e.g., sediment load differences are seen better in the visible band and, in some cases, vegetation differences are seen better in the near- and mid-infrared bands). In general, some of the colors seen in the change-image composite correspond to the following:          Magenta  - These pixels/locations were more vegetated in 1984 than in 1993. Examples of this are the loss of wetlands along the Bay or where there is less natural vegetation/grass in the foothills in 1993 due to differences in the amount of rainfall. Also, the vegetation type can be the same on both dates but either the density or level of maturity of the vegetation on the two dates is different (i.e., more dense/mature in 1984 than 1993).         Green  - Green is the opposite of magenta (i.e., more vegetated in 1993 than in 1984). This mostly occurs in agricultural areas and is related to crop rotation, crop type changes, or crop density/maturity differences between the two dates.         Blue  - Most areas that are blue represent urban growth between 1984 and 1993. These are areas where either new residential or industrial development occurred between 1984 and 1993. Examples include the blues seen on the east side of extreme South Bay which represents mostly new industrial buildings, while the blues north of Carquinez Strait, in Livermore, and elsewhere are areas with new residential development between the two dates.         White  - White areas show where dramatic changes in surface brightness/reflectance occurred; these areas were much brighter in 1993 than in 1984. Examples of this are the clouds in the lower left portion of the image, and areas that were burned in 1984 and have recovered by 1993. Other examples are seen north of Mallard Island and an area due east from the image center/east side of the foothills.         Black  - The black areas also had a dramatic change in surface brightness/reflectance, but were darker rather than brighter in 1993 versus 1984. Examples of this are areas burned in 1993 or were natural landscape areas in 1984 that were converted to agricultural lands and recently tilled.                          South Bay Area        Carquinez Strait Area            Honker Bay Area                  Included here are three different subareas at 1X, 2X, and 4X zoom. The subareas shown from left to right are: the east side of extreme South Bay, just north of Carquinez Strait, and just northeast of Honker Bay, respectively. The images demonstrate the level of detail contained in the Landsat TM thirty-meter resolution images, and the digital change image generated using the 1984 and 1993 data. The 1984, 1993, and change image subareas were digitally mosaicked next to each other for comparison and display purposes. These image products show the level of information that can be extracted from the data.                      Project Team:         Pat S.

GX001-63-1951714	Flagstaff Atlas    Landsat Thematic Mapper Images     Click on thumbnail images to view larger image. Images are approximately 800 x 800, and may be in excess of 500 kb.     The Landsat TM imaging system, launched in 1982 by the United States, collects six reflective spectral bands (blue, green, red, near infrared, and two mid infrared), having a spatial resolution of 30 meters, and a thermal band having 120 meter spatial resolution. The area covered by a single image is approximately 185 by 185 km (115 by 115 miles); the satellite orbits at an altitude of about 700 km (438 miles). Landsat TM images collected on June 22, 1991, and on January 15, 1983, were used for this project; the June image had a near maximum sun elevation angle, whereas the January image had a near minimum angle. A low sun elevation angle is better at enhancing structural features, even though in this case, there was some snow cover in the area. These data were corrected to remove geometric distortions and radiometric noise. Absolute radiometric calibration and corrections were not needed because the application is aimed at extracting high frequency information (that is, linear/structural features). The digital data were processed using spatial filters to enhance the structural information at several different frequencies, including both edge and textural enhancements. These types of digital image processing procedures generate image products useful in helping identify both areas that contain individual lineaments and areas with a high density of surface fractures (both important in surface to ground water relations).              Figure 1 -- Landsat Thematic Mapper 1991 --  2 3 4          This image was generated using the June 22, 1991 Landsat TM data. Spectral bands 2 (green), 3 (red), and 4 (near infrared) were used to generate the color composite. Vegetation is red due to its high reflectance in the near infrared spectral band, which was used as the red component in the color composite. Landmarks that can easily be identified and are labeled in Figure 1 are: Flagstaff, Mount Elden, the airport, Interstates 17 and 40, and upper Lake Mary. Also seen on this image are: Mormon Lake, Oak Creek Canyon, southern base of the San Francisco Peaks, and Camp Navajo. This image was collected during the time of year that has a near maximum sun elevation angle, which is not ideal for the enhancement of structural information; however, some of the regional structural patterns can be seen on this product.                     Figure 2 -- Landsat Thematic Mapper 1983 --  2 3 4          This image was generated using the January 15, 1983 Landsat TM data. As in Figure 1, spectral bands 2 (green), 3 (red), and 4 (near infrared) were used to generate the color composite. Vegetation is also red in this composite because the same spectral band combination was used. Some of the same landmarks can be seen, but due to the snow cover and lower background contrast they do not stand out as nicely. This image was collected close to the time of year that has a near minimum sun elevation angle, which is optimal for structural enhancement; therefore, most of the structural information was enhanced more than in the summer/June image shown in Figure 1. Keep in mind that this is a single static representation of the digital image; the digital image can be manipulated using image processing tools and procedures to selectively enhance both regional and/or local areas of interest interactively.                     Figure 3 -- Landsat Thematic Mapper 1991 --  2 4 5          This image was generated using the June 22, 1991 Landsat TM data. Spectral bands 2 (green), 4 (near infrared), and 5 (mid-infrared) were used to generate the color composite. In this case, vegetation is green because the near infrared spectral band was used as the green component in the color composite. The image covers a smaller area than Figures 1 and 2 because it is at a larger scale (zoomed). Several landmarks are labeled on this image: Flagstaff, Mount Elden, Interstates 17 and 40, the airport, and upper Lake Mary are labeled on this image. Note the regional and local structural information that can be seen at this scale.                     Figure 11 -- Landsat Thematic Mapper 1991 Stereo Image          This image is the results of using the DEM data to introduce parallax into the Landsat TM image collected on June 22, 1991 to generate a stereo image. The near infrared spectral band (TM band 4) was used to generate the stereo image; to see the 3-D topographic component use the red and blue glasses (red on the left). This type of digital merging allows the information contents of two different data sets to be combined and viewed together. It basically 'lays' the satellite image on top of the topography so that the best of both data sets can be seen simultaneously. The landmarks identified in previous figures can also be seen in this image (e.g., Lake Mary, Mount Elden, Oak Creek Canyon fault, and Flagstaff).                     Figure 12 -- Landsat Thematic Mapper 1983 Stereo Image          This is identical to the image product shown in Figure 11 except that the Landsat TM image collected on January 15, 1983 was used rather than the June 22, 1991 TM image. This image has some snow cover and goes far enough north to include the San Francisco Peaks. Generally, structural features are enhanced better in this image due to the lower sun elevation angle during the winter. The 3-D topographic component can be seen using the red and blue glasses (red on the left).

There are two types of Level 1B data available:            Single-Scene AVHRR  data consists of a single scene that was collected by a single AVHRR satellite on a specific date and time. The approximate scene size is 2400 x 6400 kilometers (1491 x 4000 miles).  The data is available from the USGS/EROS Data Center (EDC) to approved USGS researchers only, and is provided in binary (10-bit packed) format on 8-mm tape. Public distribution is via the  NOAA Satellite Active Archive .        Stitched Orbital Segments  consist of single-scene AVHRR data stitched together within an orbit, and is available for limited dates only. Each segment is composed of five channels with a resolution of 1.1 kilometers at nadir.  The data is provided in binary (10-bit packed) format, and is distributed on 8-mm tape and via    FTP download .         Georegistered (Level 1b) Single-Scene AVHRR  is radiometrically and geometrically corrected single-scene AVHRR data that is processed according to user-specified parameters such as projection, resampling method, and pixel size. The data is available in binary (8- or 10-bit) format, and is distributed on CD-ROM or DVD.   In addition to the AVHRR data listed above, the USGS also produces a series of derived  AVHRR NDVI composites  and  Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC)  data.

The resulting EarthSat thematic mapper (TM) geocover data set contains orthorectified Landsat TM sensor data from the Landsat-4 and -5 satellites. Only the Landsat images that most closely met a specific set of criteria, including acquisition date, cloud percentage, data quality parameters, and best available phenology, were considered for the collection.  The Landsat TM data were compiled through a NASA contract with Earth Satellite Corporation, Rockville, Maryland, and are part of NASA's Scientific Data Purchase program, developed in response to the President's Space Policy.     Approximately 8,500 Landsat TM images were selected.  The acquisition dates of these images were relative to a 1990 acquisition baseline, and the images were either cloud-free or contained minimal cloud cover.  In addition, only TM images with a high quality ranking in regards to the possible presence of errors such as missing scans or saturated bands were selected. It was important to collect data during periods of peak greenness so NASA adopted an approach for image selection that was based upon a data set containing global 1-kilometer Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data.  It was sometimes difficult for NASA to obtain clear images during time frames of peak greenness, resulting in some image substitution from other times of the year.     Landsat images were orthorectified, using geodetic and elevation control data to correct for positional accuracy and relief displacement.  Large blocks of Landsat data were adjusted through a patented procedure that uses pixel correlation to acquire tie-points within the overlap area between adjacent Landsat images.  Ground control points are fixed, and images are projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator map projection, using the World Geodetic System 1984 datum.  All bands are individually resampled, using a nearest neighbor algorithm.  The result is a final product with a Root Mean Square Error of better than 50 meters in positional accuracy.

However, it has a relatively poor temporal resolution with a revisit time of about two weeks. Also, images are collected during mid-morning (about 10:30 AM), which is not good for monitoring the peak frequency of desert dust storms that occur in the afternoon. The spatial and spectral resolutions make the Landsat MSS data good for generating eolian erosion vulnerability image maps. When an active dust storm is imaged, however, they can be quite dramatic as shown in the Landsat MSS image below.

The law also identifies goals for the            policy. This document, in accordance with the law, establishes a data            policy for Landsat 7 that covers the acquisition, processing, archival,            distribution and pricing policy for Landsat 7 data. Roles and responsibilities            for Landsat 7 system development and operations are contained in the            Management Plan for the Landsat Program.               As required by P.L. 102-555,            this Data Policy is designed to achieve the following:                                                    Ensure                that unenhanced data are available to all users at the cost of fulfilling                user requests;                                          Ensure                timely and dependable delivery of unenhanced data to the full spectrum                of civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign users and                the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive (NSLRSDA);                                                         Ensure                that the United States retains ownership of all unenhanced data                generated by Landsat 7;                                          Support                the development of the commercial market for remote sensing data;                                                         Ensure                that the provision of commercial value-added services based on remote                sensing data remains exclusively the function of the private sector;                and                                          To the                extent possible, ensure that the data distribution system for Landsat                7 is compatible with the Earth Observing System Data and Information                System (EOSDIS).                                     The Landsat 7 system will            comprise a spacecraft carrying an Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)            instrument and a ground segment consisting of mission operations, data            capture, ground processing, data archiving, and data product distribution            elements. The ETM+ is a nadir-pointing, eight spectral band instrument            designed to provide data continuity with the Thematic Mapper instruments            on Landsats 4 and 5.                Acquisition            Data acquisition by the ETM+ on Landsat 7 will be directed by the mission            goal of acquiring and updating periodically a global archive of daytime,            substantially cloud-free images of land areas. In addition to the periodic            global archive acquisitions, Landsat 7 will acquire every daytime scene            on every pass over the United States. However, the Landsat operator            will modify the acquisition schedule for the global archive mission            and the standing order for scenes of the United States to accommodate            time-critical observations and other requests based on the following            order of priorities:                                         Spacecraft                and instrument health and safety                                           Time                critical acquisitions related to national security, natural disasters                and environmental emergencies                                           Time                critical acquisitions to support large campaigns and other key US                Government (USG) programs                                           Acquisitions                critical to the global archive mission                                           Acquisition                requests from individuals and commercial entities                                     Conflicts in the acquisition            schedule will be resolved by the Landsat operator according to the priorities            listed above and policy guidelines established by the Landsat Coordinating            Group (LCG) acting on behalf of Landsat Program Management.                        Non-time critical requests            for acquisitions will be received by the EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive            Center (DAAC) at the US Geological Survey's EROS Data Center (EDC) in            Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Requests for time critical acquisitions will            be received directly by the Landsat operator.               The primary USG ground station            will be located at EDC. The ground station will have the capability            to capture both real-time and recorded data via direct transmission            from Landsat 7. Secondary USG ground stations for Landsat 7 will be            located in the Fairbanks, Alaska area and Svalbard, Norway. The secondary            station(s) will serve as backup for the primary station and ensure that            the requirement for scene acquisitions is met. In addition, the Landsat            7 system will be capable of transmitting data in real-time to other,            non-USG* ground stations.               USG ground stations will            operate according to the data acquisition priorities defined in this            document. Non-USG stations will receive data upon request and limited            by the allocation of spacecraft assets for providing direct transmission            data. These direct downlink resources will be scheduled in a balanced            and equitable manner consistent with the achievement of the global archive            mission goal.               The Landsat 7 operator will            develop a standard ground station agreement which each non-USG operator            must sign to be authorized to receive Landsat 7 data. This agreement            will include conditions such as: provision for acquisition scheduling            and availability of the direct downlink; the use of non-USG ground stations            as contingency backups or supplements for USG data acquisition; retention            of ownership by USG of all unenhanced data from Landsat 7; the reception,            archiving and cataloging of remotely received data; the availability            of these data; exchange of metadata and image data between the non-USG            ground station and the EDC-DAAC; the technical services available to            the ground stations; and the fees associated with access to data. The            Landsat 7 operator will endeavor to provide all requested coverage with            the ETM+ sensor within the coverage circle of authorized ground stations,            within the limits of the Landsat 7 system's resources and in accordance            with conflict resolution guidelines.                Processing            EDC will generate Level 0R data files, metadata, and browse images for            all Landsat 7 data received by the Landsat 7 Ground Station at EDC.            The EDC-DAAC will provide access to the Landsat 7 metadata and browse            images on a non-discriminatory basis and will generate Level 0R, Level            1R, and Level 1G data products on request (see Attachment for descriptions            of the data products) for distribution to Landsat data users.                        Data processing beyond the            Level 1 products distributed through EDC is the responsibility of the            users and will be accomplished with user-owned capabilities or those            available from private sector suppliers.                Archive            EDC will archive, at a minimum, all Landsat 7 Level 0R data files, metadata,            and browse images generated at EDC and metadata and browse products            provided to EDC by the Landsat 7 non-USG ground stations.                Distribution            Landsat 7, Level 0R, Level 1R and Level 1G data products will be distributed            in a timely manner on a non-discriminatory basis, within the technical            limitations of the system. The USG will impose no restrictions on subsequent            use, sale, or redistribution of data from Landsat 7.               Should demand for data products            exceed the daily capacity at EDC, orders for data will be processed            based on the same priorities as data acquisition.               EDC will provide standard            services associated with distribution of Landsat 7 data including distribution            in defined, standard product format(s).

Pathfinder projects focus on the investigation of global change while utilizing remote    sensing technologies. The NALC project is a cooperative effort between the U.S.    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and NASA to make    Landsat data available to the widest possible user community for scientific research and    general public interest. The NALC project is principally funded by the EPA Office of    Research and Development's Global Warming Research Program (GWRP) and the USGS' Earth    Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center. The objectives of the NALC project are    to develop standardized remotely sensed data sets and standard analysis methods in support    of investigations of changes in land cover; to develop inventories of terrestrial carbon    stocks; to assess carbon cycling dynamics; and to map terrestrial sources of greenhouse    gas (CO, CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions (Lunetta and Sturdevant, 1993).            3.0 Data Set Characteristics        The NALC project includes Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) data acquired in the    years 1973, 1986, and 1991, plus or minus one year, with geographic coverage including the    conterminous United States and Mexico. The specific temporal windows vary for geographic    regions based on the seasonal characteristics of the vegetation cover. The NALC triplicate    scenes are geographically referenced to a 60- by 60-meter Universal Transverse Mercator    (UTM) ground coordinate grid.            4.0 Procedures             4.1 NALC Triplicate Processing Steps        The process of generating the triplicates involves a multi-stream approach. The 1980's      image is precision corrected and registered to a map base using a three-step approach and      is used as the cartographic base to which the 1970's and 1990's data are registered. A      relational data base has been developed and maintained, which contains the corner      coordinates and quadrangle names for United States 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. This      data base was augmented with similar information for the 1:250,000- and 1:50,000-scale      topographic maps for Mexico acquired from the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia      e Informatica (INEGI) in Aguascalientes, Mexico. The latitude and longitude coordinates of      the 1980's scene to be used for a given triplicate are intersected with the map data base      to identify the topographic maps which fall within that particular Landsat Worldwide      Reference System-2 (Landsats 4 and 5) path/row.       The 1980's image is precision corrected and registered to a map base. In rare      situations, multiple 1980's images are used to produce a cloud-reduced composite. The      registration entails the selection of image and planimetric source control points for use      in developing the model for precision correction. Control point sources used include      1:100,000-scale USGS digital line graph (DLG) data and 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic      maps for triplicates within the United States, and 1:50,000-scale maps for triplicates      outside of the conterminous United States. The DLGs are components of the National Digital      Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB) and are comprised of the various thematic layers (e.g.,      transportation, hydrography, hypsography, political boundaries) depicted on the      1:100,000-scale topographic map series (USGS, 1989). For triplicates within the United      States, the DLG data are the primary source for control point selection. The DLGs are      interactively overlain onto the imagery to facilitate visual correlation of area features      between the imagery and the DLG data. Once a feature match has been identified, the image      (line, sample) and DLG (latitude, longitude) coordinates for a specific point along the      feature are extracted and compiled in a control point file Approximately 30 to 35 points      are extracted.       The next step in triplicate generation involves mosaicking the digital elevation model      (DEM) data and transforming the DEM data's original geographic projection to a UTM      projection. The DEM data used in the NALC project are derived from Defense Mapping Agency      (DMA) Level-1 Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) (USGS, 1987), which were digitized      from the standard National Topographic Map Series 1:250,000-scale maps. These maps provide      complete United States coverage. The DEM data, often referred to as the 3-arc-second DTED      data, are available as gridded files corresponding to 1-degree-latitude by      1-degree-longitude blocks. These blocks are mosaicked by path/row, then projected and      resampled to 60- by 60-meter pixels in a UTM projection.       Elevation values for the ground control points are retrieved from the DEM data. The      ground control points containing X, Y, and elevation values are corrected for relief      displacement. The relief-corrected control points are then used to compute the      coefficients for a second order polynomial model that is used to geometrically correct and      reproject the 1980's MSS image to a UTM ground control coordinate system. Using cubic      convolution, the image is rectified and resampled to a UTM-projected output image      comprised of 60- by 60-meter pixels. As of July 28, 1994, a full terrain correction is      also applied to the 1980's image by correcting for the effects of relief displacement on a      pixel-by-pixel basis using the previously created DEM image.       A verification of registration quality is performed using control points selected from      either 1:24,000-scale maps or 1:100,000-scale DLG source material. Selection of 12 to 15      verification control points proceeds in a manner similar to the selection of registration      points. Scenes must meet quality objectives of total Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of      less than 1.0 pixel for United States scenes, and total RMSEs of less than 1.5 pixels for      Mexican scenes (where control sources are less reliable). Registration control points are      reselected for scenes which fail to meet quality objectives.       The final geocoded 1980's component for each triplicate is a six-band image. Bands 1      through 4 are comprised of MSS bands 1 through 4, band 5 (an NDVI computed from MSS bands      2 and 4), and band 6 (a pixel-identity band in which pixel values greater than or equal to      1 correspond to valid image data and pixel values of 0 correspond to non-image fill). The      non-zero pixel identity values can be referenced to the alphanumeric attribute labels in      the metadata records. The pixel-identity images can be used to disaggregate a composite      image into its constituent source images in order to accommodate scene-specific processing      requirements (e.g., atmospheric correction, normalization of solar illumination angles).       The following systematic, radiometric, and geometric corrections are applied to 1970's      MSS CCT-X data to generate the EROS Digital Image Processing System's EDIPS-P product. The      CCT-X formatted data are preprocessed to correct for line length adjustments, variable      detector response, band registration, nonlinear mirror-scan velocity, Earth rotational      skew, and detector-to-detector offsets. The images are destriped to compensate for      variations in the radiometric response of the individual detectors prior to geometric      registration, because the noise is scan-line dependent. Using the satellite ephemeris data      and platform navigation model, an interim systematic correction is then applied to      generate a UTM-projected output image with a north-up orientation. Automated      cross-correlation procedures (Bernstein, 1983; Scambos and others, 1992) are then      implemented to extract control points from the 1970's and 1980's images to compute      coefficients for image-to-image registration. This involves the use of a single band from      each of the 1970's input images. Once an accurate transformation is developed, the grid      for the interim systematic correction is convolved with the image-to-image transformation      grid to produce coefficients, which facilitate a single-step registration of the 1970's      P-product with the map-registered 1980's image. The net result is an image registration      procedure that only involves one step of resampling. As of July 28, 1994, a full terrain      correction is also applied to the 1970's image by correcting for the effects of relief      displacement on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the previously created DEM image.       Cross-correlation procedures are also used to extract over 100 control points that are      used for verification of image-to-image registration quality (1970's to 1980's) with      target total RMSEs of less than 1.0 pixel. Previous studies have shown that the use of      polynomial transformations alone on CCT-X format data yield only a 1.5-pixel to 2.0-pixel      internal image accuracy once map projected, but the use of a satellite model overcomes      this problem. Should the scene fail to meet quality objectives, image-to-image      cross-correlation parameters may be altered and new registration control extracted or      hand-selected image-to-image control may be used.       The last step involves the creation of a pixel-identity band to accompany each of the      1970's images. Each pixel identity value is indexed to the specific 1970's scene used to      fill-in the WRS-2 path/row tile with pixel values of 0 representing non-image fill.      Typically, two or more 1970's images are required to provide complete coverage of a WRS-2      path/row tile.       The procedures for the 1990's image registration are similar to those for the 1970's      data except that the 1990's data are acquired as P-level products. An interim systematic      correction is applied to generate a north-up, UTM-projected image. Automated      cross-correlation procedures are used to select control points and a transformation grid      is computed for the image-to-image registration. The interim and precision transformation      grids are convolved into a single grid which is then applied to the 1990's input to create      its 1980's coregistered equivalent. Similar to the 1970's processing, this involves only      one step of resampling. As of July 28, 1994, a full terrain correction is also applied to      the 1990's image by correcting for the effects of relief displacement on a pixel-by-pixel      basis using the previously corrected DEM image.       The verification of image-to-image registration quality is performed using      cross-correlation procedures as was performed on the 1970's image. The target RMSE for      this registration is less than 1.0 pixel. Should the scene fail to meet quality      objectives, image-to-image cross-correlation parameters may be altered and new      registration control extracted or hand-selected image-to-image control may be used.       Similar to the 1980's image, the 1990's component of each triplicate is a six-band image      comprised of MSS bands 1 through 4, an NDVI image, and a pixel-identity image.       Prior to March 20, 1995, cloud-reduced compositing was performed after all the image      data were coregistered. This step was performed only in cases where 1990's scenes with 30      percent or less cloud cover were not available. To minimize the amount of cloud cover in      the 1980's or 1990's triplicate component, the EROS Data Center (EDC) adapted Advanced      Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) cloud compositing procedures for use in NALC      triplicate generation (Eidenshink, 1992; Holben, 1986). The compositing process operates      on image pairs and is based on the NDVI:          (band 4 - band 2)/(band 4 + band 2)             This index is sensitive to variations in surface characteristics, such as biomass, and      is sensitive to clouds (Justice and others, 1985). The NDVI is computed for each of the      images to be used for compositing purposes. The maximum NDVI value determines which input      image pixel brightness values will be used to constitute the output image. This maximum      NDVI decision rule is computationally efficient and yields consistent results. A 1980's      triplicate component which has been composited or a 1990's triplicate component which has      been composited, or both components, will have a maximum NDVI image and a pixel-identity      image.       The NALC triplicate production process has undergone several modifications since      processing began in January 1993:       January 1993: Triplicate production begins.       March 15, 1993: Ended the compositing of 1970's images. Multiple 1970's scenes were      mosaicked prior to this date. The 1970's mosaicked images for the 15 triplicates completed      before this date were separated into their individual components.       March 19, 1993: Ended variable product size. Began standardizing triplicate dimensions      at 5,000-by-5,000 pixels. Prior to this date, product size was determined by adding a set      amount of padding around the registered image data.       June 10, 1993: Ended standardized 5,000-by-5,000 pixel triplicate dimensions. Back to      variable triplicate size. Began annotating triplicate components with project, scene date,      path/row, and DEM data source.       July 28, 1994: Full terrain correction implemented on all triplicate components.       March 20, 1995: Ended the compositing of 1990's scenes.            5.0 Restrictions        The Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) for Mexico were acquired from the Instituto    Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), and the distribution of these    data is restricted. Only nonprofit organizations may acquire these data upon signing the    restricted distribution form stating that the DEM data will be used for research purposes    only and that the data will not be redistributed to any third parties.            6.0 USGS Contact         Customer Services  U.S. Geological Survey  EROS Data Center  47914 252nd Street  Sioux Falls, SD   57198-0001  Tel: 800-252-4547  Tel: 605-594-6151  TDD: 605-594-6933  Fax: 605-594-6589  Email:  custserv@usgs.gov             7.0 References        Bernstein, Ralph, 1983, Image geometry and rectification, in Colwell, R.N., ed., Manual    of Remote Sensing: Falls Church, Va., American Society of Photogrammetry, p. 881-884.

DIRECTION), DATE (excluding the date last      modified), and TIME fields correspond to the 1980's reference image. Projection      information and corner coordinates are always the same for each component of a triplicate.      All other parameters and values relate to EDC's processing software and are not relevant      to NALC customers.       Starting July 28, 1994, full terrain correction was implemented on all triplicate      components. The image naming convention was changed at the same time.

The actual number of files may vary slightly, depending upon the NALC      triplicate.       Each image file is in band-sequential (BSQ) format and has corresponding files in ASCII      format, including a data descriptor file and a metadata file. If a waiver is not signed      for triplicates that contain restricted DEM data for Mexico, then the NALC README file is      directly followed by files for an MSS 1970's scene.       File 1.

Image Data File: Either contains a single band of DEM image data or contains MSS image      data in a band-sequential format.       Metadata File: Either contains DEM image metadata or contains MSS image metadata.       The image files vary in size (i.e., number of bands, number of lines, and number of      samples), depending on the requirements for cloud compositing and depending on the      creation date of the triplicate. As of June 14, 1993, all 1970's images contain five bands      (i.e., MSS bands 1 through 4 and a pixel-identity image) and all 1980's and 1990's images      contain six bands (i.e., MSS bands 1 through 4, an NDVI image, and a pixel-identity      image).       Users are encouraged to first examine the data descriptor file, because it specifies the      number of lines (NL), the number of samples (NS), and the number of bands (NB) in the      image, as well as specifying geographic coordinates. The UTM corner points correspond to      the four corners of the array and are always based on the 1980's scene (also referred to      as the reference scene). The array contains the fully geocoded scene including the      zero-fill and annotation areas.       The DEM files and the image files contain the same NL and NS dimensions. The DEM is in a      16-bit INTEGER*2 data format (also known as a 16-bit signed integer format), whereas the      MSS images are BYTE data (also known as 8-bit unsigned integer data).       The number of bytes per record in image files is equivalent to the number of pixels per      line. The total number of records per file, divided by the number of bands, is equivalent      to the total number of lines in the image.       Files are written to tape in chronological order by date and preceded by DEM files where      applicable (i.e., DEM file(s); 1970's file(s); 1980's file(s); and 1990's file(s)). If a      waiver is not signed for triplicates that contain restricted DEM data for Mexico, then      only the MSS portion of the triplicate is provided (i.e., 1970's file(s); 1980's file(s);      and 1990's file(s)).            8.5 Sample NALC Tape Mapper        The following represents a typical mapper for a NALC tape that contains a NALC README      file, a DEM, two 1970's images, a 1980's image, a 1990's image, and their associated data      descriptor and metadata files. The DEM image file consists of INTEGER*2 data (16-bit      signed integer data) so the total number of bytes per record is twice the number of      samples per line. The total number of records in the DEM image file is equivalent to the      total number of lines in the image. If a waiver is not signed for triplicates that contain      restricted DEM data for Mexico, then the tape will contain the NALC README file followed      by the data descriptor file for the first 1970's image.       The 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's MSS images are BYTE data (8-bit unsigned integer data).      Therefore, the number of bytes per record is equivalent to the number of samples per line      in the image. The 1970's images contain five bands (MSS bands 1 through 4 and a      pixel-identity image); thus, the total number of records in the image file equals five      times the number of lines in the image. The 1980's and 1990's images contain six bands      each (MSS bands 1 through 4, an NDVI image, and a pixel-identity image). Consequently,      each of these files has a total number of records that is equivalent to six times the      number of lines in the image.       We recommend that users read the NALC README and data descriptor files first. These      files describe the characteristics of the data sets, which are typically transcribed to      the proper parameters for retrieving the image data from tape.     ********** Mapper of tape [n] mounted on DRIVE [n] **********          6 RECORDS   4097 BYTES LONG          1 RECORDS   1784 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #1 >>>>> 7 TOTAL RECORDS.      -- NALC README               1 RECORDS   1919 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #2 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.      -- DEM Data Descriptor             3883 RECORDS   8194 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #3 >>>>> 3883 TOTAL RECORDS.   -- DEM Image                1 RECORDS    674 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #4 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.      -- DEM Metadata                1 RECORDS   4097 BYTES LONG          1 RECORDS    157 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #5 >>>>> 2 TOTAL RECORDS.      -- 1st 1970's MSS Image                                                Data Descriptor          19415 RECORDS   4097 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #6 >>>>> 19415 TOTAL RECORDS.  -- 1st 1970's MSS Image                1 RECORDS    674 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #7 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.      -- 1st 1970's MSS Image Metadata                1 RECORDS   3786 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #8 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.      -- 2nd 1970's MSS Image                                                Data Descriptor         19415 RECORDS   4097 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #9 >>>>> 19415 TOTAL RECORDS.  -- 2nd 1970's MSS Image                1 RECORDS    674 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #10 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.     -- 2nd 1970's MSS Image Metadata                1 RECORDS   3786 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #11 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.     -- 1980's MSS Image                                                Data Descriptor         23298 RECORDS   4097 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #12 >>>>> 23298 TOTAL RECORDS. -- 1980's MSS Image                1 RECORDS    686 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #13 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.     -- 1980's MSS Image Metadata                1 RECORDS   3786 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #14 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.     -- 1990's MSS Image                                                Data Descriptor         23298 RECORDS   4097 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #15 >>>>> 23298 TOTAL RECORDS. -- 1990's MSS Image                1 RECORDS    686 BYTES LONG   END OF FILE #16 >>>>> 1 TOTAL RECORDS.     -- 1990's MSS Image Metadata         **********  END OF VOLUME  **********      --------------------------------          89327 RECORDS IN VOLUME.                8.6 Retrieving Tape Files Using Unix ""DD""        The following example illustrates how the files can be read from tape using the Unix      ""dd"" utility. The example uses information contained in the preceding sample      tape mapper. Substitute the appropriate values for your path/row. When using      ""dd"" to retrieve files from a tape, always use the number of bytes in the mapper      for your input block size (ibs) in the ""dd"" command.       To retrieve the NALC README file:       dd if=(device name) of=(output file name) ibs=4097       To retrieve the DEM data descriptor file:       dd if=(device name) of=(output file name) ibs=1919       To retrieve the DEM image file:       dd if=(device name) of=(output file name) ibs=8194       There are 8194 bytes in the tape mapper for the DEM image, which is twice the number of      bytes that are found in the MSS images. This is because DEM data are stored in INTEGER*2      (16-bit signed integer) format and requires two bytes per pixel. The number of records in      the DEM file is exactly equal to the number of lines in the image (no division by number      of bands is necessary to find the number of lines, since the DEM is a one-band image).       To retrieve the DEM metadata file:       dd if=(device name) of=(output file name) ibs=674       The tape should now be at the data descriptor file for the first 1970's MSS image.      Repeat the previous steps for each set of files, using the appropriate input block size      (ibs) each time.       When the tape is positioned at the first 1970's MSS image file, it is then possible to:      (1) load the image one band at a time with five separate output files (i.e., multiple      single-band files) or (2) load all bands into one file (one multiple-band file in BSQ      format).       To load all five bands into one BSQ file, use the following ""dd"" command:       dd if=(device name) of=(output image name) ibs=4097       To load each band into its own separate file, use the following ""dd"" command:       dd if=(device name) of=(output image name) ibs=4097 count=3883       The additional COUNT parameter is required when loading each band into a separate file.      The value for COUNT is equal to the number of lines in the image. Again, the number of      lines in the image is found by dividing the number of records by the number of bands. All      MSS data are stored as BYTE (8-bit unsigned integer) data.

MSS data provide a historical record of the Earth's land surface from the early 1970's to the early 1990's. Designated initially as the Earth Resources Technology Satellite-A (ERTS-A), it used a Nimbus-type platform that was modified to carry sensor systems and data relay equipment. When operational orbit was achieved, it was designated ERTS-1. The satellite continued to function beyond its designed life expectancy of one year and finally ceased to operate on January 6, 1978, more than five years after its launch date. The second in this series of Earth resources satellites (designated ERTS-B) was launched January 22, 1975. It was renamed Landsat 2 by NASA, which also renamed ERTS-1 to Landsat 1. Three additional Landsats were launched in 1978, 1982, and 1984 (Landsats 3, 4, and 5 respectively). Each successive satellite system had mproved sensor and communications capabilities.     Purpose:       To provide comprehensive MSS imagery for use in a variety of applications.

Data_Quality_Information:         Attribute_Accuracy:         Attribute_Accuracy_Report:       The identification of features is provided by the distinct electromagnetic energy it emits, reflects, or otherwise transmits. This is called the spectral signature. Other signatures are tone (lightnes or darkness), texture (surface roughness or smoothness), pattern, shadow, shape and size are as important. Thus, through the use of multispectral scanners, such elements as water features, soils, and vegetation can be identified and distinguished from each other.         Logical_Consistency_Report:       The Landsat platforms operate from a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit imaging the same 185 km (115 miles) ground swath every 16 days (formerly 18 days on Landsats 1 through 3). Multispectral scanner (MSS) data were received directly from Landsats 4 and 5 by a network of 16 worldwide ground stations. Also, data were transmitted via a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) to its ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico, and then relayed via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT) to the data processing facility. The MSS digital data were radiometrically corrected and relayed by DOMSAT to the EROS Data Center for storage, reproduction into digital and film formats, and distribution to users. The TDRS System (TDRSS) satellites in geosynchronous orbits. This configuration allowed the acquisition of MSS data for nearly all of the Earth's surface, except for an area between 50 degrees north and 67 degrees east by 50 degrees south and 82 degrees east. That area may be covered in part by data recorders at the Thailand and India ground stations.     Completeness_Report:       All of the Landsats have been in sun-synchronous orbits with equatorial crossing times ranging from 8:30 a.m. for Landsat 1, 9 a.m. for Landsat 2, to 9:45 a.m. for Landsat 5.     Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:         Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       The multispectral scanner (MSS) sensors were line scanning devices observing the Earth perpendicular to the orbital track. The cross-track scanning was accomplished by an oscillating mirror; six lines were scanned simultaneously in each of the four spectral bands for each mirror sweep. The forward motion of the satellite provided the along-track scan line progression. All five Landsats have carried the MSS sensor which responds to Earth-reflected sunlight in four spectral bands. Landsat 3 carried an MSS sensor with an additional band, designated band 8, that responded to thermal (heat) infrared radiation. The radiometric range of bands for the MSS sensor is shown below: (Handbook, 1979 and 1984, USGS). Wavelength Landsats 1-3 Landsats 4-5 (micrometers)   Band 4 Band 1 0.5 - 0.6 Band 5 Band 2 0.6 - 0.7 Band 6 Band 3 0.7 - 0.8 Band 7 Band 4 0.8 - 1.1 Band 8 10.4 - 12.6           Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:         Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:       Landsats 1 through 3 operated in a near-polar orbit at an altitude of 920 km with an 18-day repeat coverage cycle. These satellites circled the Earth every 103 minutes, completing 14 orbits a day. Eighteen days and 251 overlapping orbits were required to provide nearly complete coverage of the Earth's surface with 185 km wide image swaths. The amount of swath overlap or sidelap varies from 14 percent at the equator to a maximum of approximately 85 percent at 81 north or south latitude. These satellites carried two sensors: a return beam vidicon (RBV) and a MSS. The RBV sensor was essentially a television camera and did not achieve the popularity of the MSS sensor. The MSS sensor scanned the Earth's surface from west to east as the satellite moved in its descending (north-to-south) orbit over the sunlit side of the Earth. Six detectors for each spectral band provided six scan lines on each active scan. The combination of scanning geometry, satellite orbit, and Earth rotation produced the global coverage necessary for studying land surface change. The resolution of the MSS sensor was approximately 80 m with radiometric coverage in four spectral bands from the visible green to the near-infrared (IR) wavelengths. Only the MSS sensor on Landsat 3 had a fifth band in the thermal-IR. Landsats 4 and 5 carry both the MSS and the thematic mapper (TM) sensors; however, routine collection of MSS data was terminated in late 1992. They orbit at an altitude of 705 km and provide a 16-day, 233-orbit cycle with a swath overlap that varies from 7 percent at the Equator to nearly 84 percent at 81 north or south latitude. These satellites were also designed and operated to collect data over a 185 km swath. The MSS sensors aboard Landsats 4 and 5 are identical to the ones that were carried on Landsats 1 and 2. The MSS and TM sensors primarily detect reflected radiation from the Earth surface in the visible and IR wavelengths, but the TM sensor provides more radiometric information than the MSS sensor. The wavelength range for the TM sensor is from the visible (blue), through the mid-IR, into the thermal-IR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sixteen detectors for the visible and mid-IR wavelength bands in the TM sensor provide 16 scan lines on each active scan. Four detectors for the thermal-IR band provide four scan lines on each active scan. The TM sensor has a spatial resolution of 30 meters for the visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths and a spatial resolution of 120 meters for the thermal-IR band.                              Spatial_Data_Organization_Information:         Indirect_Spatial_Reference:       Landsats 4 and 5 MSS scenes have an instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of 68 meters in the cross-track direction by 82 meters in the along-track direction (223.0 by 272.3 feet, respectively). To understand this concept, consider a ground scene composed of a single 82- by 82-meter area. The scan monitor sensor ensures that the cross-track optical scan is 185 km at nominal altitude regardless of mirror scan nonlinearity or other perturbations of mirror velocity. Cross-track image scan velocity is nominally 6.82 meters per microsecond. After 9.958 microseconds, the 82- by 82-meter image has moved 67.9 meters. The sample taken at this instant represents 15 meters of previous information and 68 meters of new information. Therefore, the effective IFOV of the MSS detector in the cross-track direction must be considered to be 68 meters which corresponds to a nominal ground area of 68 meters by 82 meters at the satellite nadir point. Using the effective IFOV in area calculation eliminates the overlap in area between adjacent pixels.   Landsats 1 through 3 provided Earth coverage similar to Landsats 4 and 5. However, the higher altitude of Landsats 1 through 3 resulted in a different swathing pattern with the IFOV being 56 meters in the cross-track direction by 79 meters in the along-track direction (183.7 feet by 259.2 feet respectively).   The resolution for the MSS sensor is shown below:   Landsats 1-3 Landsats 4-5 (meters)   Band 4 Band 1 79/82* Band 5 Band 2 79/82 Band 6 Band 3 79/82 Band 7 Band 4 79/82 Band 8** 237   * The nominal altitude was 920 km for Landsats 1, 2, and 3. Nominal altitude for Landsats 4 and 5 is 705 km. The resolutions are approximately 79 and 82 meters respectively as a result.   ** Landsat 3 only.

The characteristics of the MSS and TM bands were selected to maximize their capabilities for detecting and monitoring different types of Earth's resources. For example, MSS band 1 can be used to detect green reflectance from healthy vegetation, and band 2 of MSS is designed for detecting chlorophyll absorption in vegetation. MSS bands 3 and 4 are ideal for recording near-IR reflectance peaks in healthy green vegetation and for detecting water-land interfaces. MSS Bands 4, 2, and 1 can be combined to make false-color composite images where band 4 controls the amount of red, band 2 the amount of green, and band 1 the amount of blue. This band combination makes vegetation appear as shades of red, brighter reds indicating more vigorously growing vegetation. Soils with no or sparse vegetation will range from white (sands) to greens or browns depending on moisture and organic matter content. Water bodies will appear blue. Deep, clear water will be dark blue to black in color, while sediment-laden or shallow waters will appear lighter in color. Urban areas will appear blue-gray in color. Clouds and snow will be bright white and they are usually distinguishable from each other by the shadows associated with the clouds.

These three basic levels of processing are: Level 0R (zero-R), Level 1R, and Level 1G. A brief explanation of each is given below with small image subsets to illustrate the differences.         Level 0 Reformatted (L0R)    The Level 0R product is reformatted, raw data. Reformatting includes shifting pixels by integer amounts to account for 1) the alternating forward-reverse scanning pattern of the ETM+ sensor, 2) the odd-even detector arrangement within each band, 3) the detector offsets inherent to the focal plan array engineering design. Pixels are neither resampled nor are they geometrically corrected or registered, i.e. the pixels are  NOT  aligned per scan line.                   The sample image at the right shows a small city in an arid region.                  Note the airport in the center of the image with the crossing                  runways.The scans in this image have received a rudimentary alignment                  of each scan to a common starting point at the extreme left of                  the image (not shown). Visible scan misalignment is still quite                  easily noticed in the upper portions of both runways as well as                  the roads to their left. Although radiometric artifacts are not                  readily apparent in this sample, any artifacts such as impulse                  noise, coherent noise, memory effects, etc. would still be in                  any L0R image.                       Level 1 Radiometrically Corrected (L1R)     The Level 1R product is a radiometrically corrected L0R product. This product 1) corrects detector artifacts such as coherent noise; 2) improves cosmetic artifacts such as banding, striping, and dropped lines or pixels; and 3) is calibrated to radiance units, i.e. color corrected, as integer values. Radiometric corrections are not reversible. Pixels are neither resampled nor are they geometrically corrected or registered, i.e. the pixels are  NOT  aligned per scan line.                   The picture at the right shows the Level 1R image. The same ""stretch""                  has been applied to this image as the L0R sample image. The radiometric                  corrections mentioned above applied are typically subtle and not                  readily apparent to casual visual inspection.  Note                   that the scan misalignments have  not  been corrected                  and are still visible in the image. Level 1R imagery also differs                  from L0R or L1G imagery in that L1R pixels have been scaled to                  16-bit values. A visual comparison of the two pixel value scales                  is illustrated  here .                        Level 1 Geometrically Corrected (L1G)            The Level 1G  product is radiometrically and      geometrically corrected(systematic) to the user-specified parameters      including output map projection, image orientation, pixel grid-cell      size, and resampling kernel. The correction algorithms model the      spacecraft and sensor using data generated by onboard computers      during imaging. Sensor, focal plane, and detector alignment information      provided by the Image Assessment System (IAS) in the Calibration      Parameter File (CPF) is also used to improve the overall geometric      fidelity. The resulting product is free from distortions related      to the sensor (e.g., jitter, view angle effect), satellite (e.g.,      attitude deviations from nominal), and Earth (e.g., rotation,      curvature). Residual error in the systematic L1G product is less      than 250 meters (1 sigma) in flat areas at sea level. The systematic      L1G correction process does not employ ground control or relief      models to attain absolute geodetic accuracy.                  The picture at right shows a small subset of the L1G image. Note how resampling                  has aligned the scans, making the runways and roads straight.

The IAS provides the capability          to routinely perform four types of geometric characterization to verify          and monitor system geometric performance, and three types of geometric          calibration to estimate improved values for key system geometric parameters.          The geometric characterizations include:                    geodetic accuracy assessment to measure the absolute accuracy of            Level 1Gs (systematic) corrected products;            geometric accuracy assessment to qualitatively and quantitatively            evaluate residual internal geometric distortions within Level 1Gs images;            band to band registration assessment to measure and monitor the relative            alignment of the eight ETM+ spectral bands; and            image-to-image registration assessment to measure and monitor multi-temporal            image registration accuracy.                The geometric calibration capabilities provided by the IAS include:                    sensor alignment calibration to provide improved knowledge of the            geometric relationship between the ETM+ optical axis and the Landsat            7 attitude control reference system;            scan mirror calibration to measure and correct any systematic deviations            in the ETM+ scan mirror along and across scan profiles; and            focal plane calibration to measure and provide improved estimates            of the eight band center locations on the two ETM+ focal planes relative            to the ETM+ optical axis. Techniques for measuring and estimating improved            values for individual detector locations and delays are being researched            and may be added to the IAS as a post-launch capability.                  The most critical geometric calibration activities involve measuring          and verifying the Landsat 7 ETM+ system performance during the Initial          On-orbit Checkout (IOC) period using the geodetic, geometric, band-to-band,          and image-to-image characterization capabilities, and to perform the initial          sensor alignment calibration. Refining the pre-launch sensor alignment          knowledge is critical to ensure that the Level 1Gs product geodetic accuracy          specification can be met. Sufficient supporting data sets (e.g., ground          control, terrain data) to perform these characterization and calibration          activities must be available at launch. The second priority during the          IOC period will be to verify and, if necessary, update the pre-launch          focal plane (particularly band placement) and scan mirror profile calibrations.          The results of these initial calibration activities will be used to verify          that the system is performing within specifications and to create an initial          post-launch release of the Calibration Parameter File which can be used          by the IAS or the Landsat 7 Level-1 Product Generation System (LPGS) to          create Level 1G products which meet the Landsat 7 geodetic accuracy requirements.          After the IOC period, ongoing calibration activities will monitor the          stability of the Landsat 7 ETM+ system's geometric performance and attempt          to identify and characterize any systematic variations in the system's          geometric parameters. This will include processing additional calibration          scenes under a variety of acquisition conditions (e.g., orbital position,          ETM+ time on) to measure the system's geometric performance as a function          of time, temperature, and location.                                           8.2.2              Sensor Alignment Calibration                Menu                                          The goal of the sensor alignment calibration is to improve the in-flight          knowledge of the relationship between the ETM+ instrument and the Landsat          7 navigation base reference. The IAS is required to estimate this alignment          to an accuracy of 24 arc seconds (per axis) at least once per calender          quarter. This calibration will use discrete ground control points in a          set of pre-defined calibration reference scenes.          The primary challenge in alignment calibration is the need to estimate          the underlying alignment trend (assumed initially to be a bias) from a          series of precision correction solutions which measure a combination of          orbit, attitude, and alignment errors. Landsat 7 will have more accurate          (estimated to be in the 10-50 meter range versus 133 meter accuracy for          the ephemeris downlinked in the Payload Correction Data) post-pass  definitive          ephemeris  data available for the alignment calibration test scenes,          reducing the uncertainty due to orbital errors. This precise ephemeris          is provided by the GSFC Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) upon request from          the IAS. Multiple precision correction solutions will be integrated using          a Kalman filter algorithm to estimate the best fit systematic alignment          bias. As additional precision correction solutions are processed by the          Kalman filter, the filter's estimates of the alignment biases will improve.          Periodically, an IAS analyst will decide that the alignment knowledge          has changed enough to warrant generating an updated sensor alignment matrix          for inclusion in the Calibration Parameter File. Initially, this decision          is based on the alignment bias covariance estimates generated by the Kalman          filter. A new set of CPF parameters are generated as soon as the bias          estimate standard deviation move below the 24-arc second alignment accuracy          requirement threshold. During normal operations, a new alignment matrix          is generated whenever a new version of the CPF was scheduled for release.                                           8.2.3              Scan Mirror Calibration                Menu                                          The behavior of the ETM+ scan mirror is measured and, if necessary,          calibrated using the IAS scan mirror calibration capability. This process          compares a terrain corrected image to a high accuracy reference image          constructed from a higher resolution source, to detect systematic deviations          of the scan mirror motion from its nominal profile. The support data used          to construct the terrain corrected image is used to generate test points          which can be related to a particular time within a particular forward          or reverse scan. By comparing these test points to the reference image          and analyzing the measured deviations as a function of scan direction          and scan time, it will be possible to estimate corrections to the pre-launch          scan mirror profiles, if needed. Any significant deviations detected will          be folded back into the Calibration Parameter File as updates to the mirror          profile polynomial coefficients.          Scan mirror calibration applies to both the along and across scan directions          so it will detect and compensate for            Scan Line Corrector (SLC)  deviations as well. In practice, SLC deviations          will be indistinguishable from scan mirror deviations so we have chosen          to model the deviations as part of the scan mirror motion. Detecting systematic          deviations which can be attributed to mirror motion requires reference          points which can be uniquely associated with individual forward and reverse          ETM+ scans and which provide a good distribution of observations as a          function of scan angle. The current approach to acquiring such a control          reference is to use spatially accurate reference imagery for one or more          calibration areas. The scan mirror calibration procedure will compare          a precision and terrain corrected ETM+ panchromatic band image with the          reference image constructed from USGS Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ)          data to detect within-scan mirror deviations. This involves constructing          an array of points in the ETM+ scan geometry which are mapped to the output          terrain corrected product. These points, with known scan number and time          in scan coordinates will be correlated with the reference image to measure          the (sub-pixel) residual distortion. The distortion patterns from many          scans will be analyzed to detect systematic deviations from the pre-launch          forward and reverse scan mirror profiles.                                           8.2.4              Focal Plane Calibration                Menu                                          The focal plane calibration operations involve measuring the alignment          of the eight ETM+ bands to ensure that band registration accuracy meets          the 0.28 pixel requirement as stated in the system specification. If the          band-to-band comparisons detect any uncompensated misalignment the band          placement calibration procedure will be used to update the band center          location parameters in the Calibration Parameter File accordingly. Detector          to detector alignment will also be monitored to ensure that image discontinuities          are not introduced by using incorrect detector locations and delays in          the Level 1G image resampling process.          Landsat 7 ETM+ images of focal plane calibration test sites will be          used to measure and calibrate the internal alignment of the detectors          on the two ETM+ focal planes. These test sites are selected based on image          content rather than the availability of supporting data. Band to band          registration assessment requires scenes which contain significant high          spatial frequency content that is common to all eight ETM+ bands. Although          it is anticipated that scenes with long linear features would be used          to assess the alignment of individual detectors, detector placement calibration          techniques are still under investigation and at this time are not a part          of the focal plan calibration procedure.

The Level 1R (L1R) product is a radiometrically corrected L0R product. This product 1) is corrected for detector artifacts such as coherent noise, banding, striping, and dropped lines or pixels; and 2) is calibrated to radiance units and scaled to unsigned 16-bit integer values. Radiometric corrections are not reversible. Pixels are neither re-sampled nor are they geometrically corrected or registered (i.e. the pixels are not aligned per scan line).     The Level 1G (L1G) product is radiometrically and geometrically corrected (systematic) to user-specified parameters including output map projection, image orientation, pixel grid-cell size, and re-sampling kernel. The correction algorithms model the spacecraft and sensor using data generated by onboard computers during imaging. The sensor, focal plane, and detector alignment information provided by the Image Assessment System (IAS) in the Calibration Parameter File (CPF) are also used to improve the overall geometric fidelity. The resulting product is free from distortions related to the sensor (e.g., jitter, view-angle effect), satellite (e.g., attitude deviations from nominal), and Earth (e.g., rotation, curvature). Residual error in the systematic L1G product is less than 250 meters (1 sigma) in flat areas at sea level. The systematic L1G correction process does not employ ground control or terrain models.    The subset images above illustrate one obvious difference between the L1R and L1G products. Note how re-sampling has aligned the scans in the L1G image, making the runways and roads straight, whereas the L1R pixels are not aligned. A more subtle difference is that the L1R data have been scaled to unsigned 16-bit integer values. As a result, L1R products have twice the data volume when compared to 8-bit L1G or L0R products.

Landsat began the land mapping in the early 1970s with a series                   of 3 MSS ( multispectral                                 scanner) satellites that mapped using the 3 visible channels                   along with a near-infrared band. In the early 1980s the next                   generation of Landsat satellites began offering what is known                   as the Thematic Mapper, which added two more infrared bands                   and a thermal long-wave infrared band, and doubled the resolution                   capabilities of the multispectral bands. Landsat 7 successfully                   debuted the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) platform in 1999.                   The ETM+ platform provides a continuation of the medium-resolution                   imagery of a quality and affordability that made TM popular.

Landsat 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) data are produced by the           National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Geological           Survey (USGS). Primary data collection and distribution is handled by           the USGS EROS (Earth Resources Observation Systems) Data Center (EDC)           in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.           Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) data are also collected by EDC, which           maintains an extensive archive of TM images from Landsats 4 and 5. The           platform has been operated by USGS since 2001.            Can I request data from the Web? Can I download the data on-line?           What media formats are the data delivered on?             TM and ETM+ data can be ordered through several Web sites. Most           sites offer the ability to download the data using FTP (file transfer           protocol), as well as offer standard delivery on either CD-ROM or 8           millimeter tape:                                     Earth               Explorer Web site  (both TM and ETM+ data)                                                                         EDC                   Distributed Active Archive Center  (ETM+ data only)                                                                                                       Global                   Land Information System  (predecessor site to Earth Explorer,                   still functioning, TM data only)                                                                                                       Global                   Land Cover Facility  (archived TM & ETM+ data)                                                          Return to top                                     Cost               What are the different processing levels that can               be requested?                 There is a small processing fee for all requests, regardless               of order size, and there may be other processing or handling fees.               (Check the  EDC                Web site for more information.) The basic cost structure is based               on the level of spatial and/or spectral correction ordered.

Contact  EDC            for more information.       Return to top                                     Data Formats/Software Needed               What types of software are required?                Most image processing platforms (ERDAS Imagine ® ,               PCI Geomatica ® , ENVI ® ,               IDRISI ® , etc.) can import a variety of               image formats, including those used for distribution of TM and ETM+               data. Common GIS programs, such as ArcView, require the raw data               to be converted to a compatible format.               Is freeware available for using these data?                 Some freeware software packages allow viewing of these data,               and some extensions for common software packages will allow you               to view and have some limited functions for working with the data.               However, if your intent is to manipulate or derive products using               spatial data information, you will likely need to use a software               package with higher capabilities.               General Questions               Can a GIS technician with some remote sensing experience               pick up these data sets and use them?                  The data can be viewed easily, using GIS or remote sensing software;               however, interpretation may require additional training in remote               sensing fundamentals.                Do these data require a trained technical person               to analyze the data?                That depends on the extent to which the data are to be analyzed.               Most GIS technicians can delineate basic features from the imagery               without any remote sensing or photogrammetry knowledge. Detailed               classifications and analyses, such as vegetation identification,               will likely require additional training or the hiring of remote               sensing-trained personnel.               Are there some nuances with the data that could               really slow you down?                Occasionally the data can have quality problems. The most typical               manifestations are data noise and data drops. Sources of high radiation               such as fires and volcanoes can saturate a sensor or cause temporary               interference after the sensors receive the high radiation.               What are the limitations of TM and ETM+ data?                These data cannot be used in lieu of high-resolution imagery. Because               the pixel size is 30 meters, the data should not be used for legal               issues, such as permitting and parcel mapping, or for small feature               identification. Landsat data are intended for regional land characterization.                The data archives are sparse for the late 80s and early 90s. During               this period, Landsat 4/5 TM data were collected only when requested.               Can the Landsat satellites be pointed at a target               area (nadir/off-nadir                            )?                No, the Landsat satellites are not adjustable off-nadir.               How do clouds affect the data?                Clouds and haze are common problems with Landsat-derived data. This               can be particularly annoying if you require data from a specific               date or time. If your temporal needs are flexible, you can select               images with the least amount of cloudiness or haze. Some areas of               the Earth pose more of a problem in this aspect, especially near               the equator. However, some software packages offer ways of merging               data from different dates to minimize cloud coverage.               Do I need to go out in the field with a GPS unit?                 Maybe, depending on the processing level of your data, and your               project's accuracy constraints. Raw Uncorrected or Radiometric Correction               level data will require some form of georeferencing or ground control               transformation. The spatial accuracy level for Systematic data is               listed as being less than 250 meters, but you may want to enhance               this accuracy by using ground control points or another georeferenced               data layer. If you are an approved researcher and are authorized               to purchase a Precision or Terrain Correction level product, you               should not need to do any further geocorrection.

This sensor is carried on             NOAA's Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites             (POES), beginning with TIROS-N in 1978.                                     AVHRR data are acquired in three formats:                                                     High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT)                                           Local Area Coverage (LAC)                                           Global Area Coverage (GAC)                                                                                        HRPT  data are full resolution image data             transmitted to a ground station as they are             collected. The average instantaneous field-of-view of             1.4 milliradians yields a HRPT ground resolution of             approximately 1.1 km at the satellite nadir from the             nominal orbit altitude of 833 km (517 mi).                                      LAC  are full resolution data that are recorded             on an on board tape for subsequent transmission             during a station overpass. The average instantaneous             field-of-view of 1.4 milliradians yields a LAC ground             resolution of approximately 1.1 km at the satellite             nadir from the nominal orbit altitude of 833 km (517             mi).                                      GAC  data are derived from a sample averaging             of the full resolution AVHRR data. Four out of every             five samples along the scan line are used to compute             one average value and the data from only every third             scan line are processed, yielding 1.1 km by 4 km             resolution at the subpoint.                                      Extent of Coverage                                      The AVHRR sensor provides global (pole to pole) on             board collection of data from all spectral channels.             Each pass of the satellite provides a 2399 km (1491             mi) wide swath. The satellite orbits the Earth 14             times each day from 833 km (517 mi) above its             surface.                                      Spatial Resolution                                      The average instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) of 1.4             milliradians yields a LAC/HRPT ground resolution of             approximately 1.1 km at the satellite nadir from the             nominal orbit altitude of 833 km (517 mi). The GAC             data are derived from an on board sample averaging of             the full resolution AVHRR data yielding 1.1-km by             4-km resolution at nadir.

GX003-45-8607110	The Load True Color Image File Widget      Description:   This procedure loads true color images from either 1) an external SeaWiFS L1A, L2, or true color TIFF file or 2) from currently loaded bands.   Notes :       True color images can't be rescaled once loaded.      There is no hard-coded limit to the number of files loaded into memory at one time.  The only limit is the memory limit of your machine.     [ Interactive mode ][ Command mode ]       Interactive mode :   From  Seadisp Main Menu   , select menu item  Load   -> True Color.   Main Section:       True Color R,G, B bands from          Input File    Load a true color image from an external SeaWiFS L1A, L2 or true color TIFF file.        Band List    Create a true color image from   3 bands which have already been loaded into memory.              Quit    Delete the  Selection For True Collor Image File Widget.   Products already loaded into memory will still be available.        Help    Show this help in HTML viewer.        Load    Create and load a pseudo-colored image from either 1) an external SeaWiFS L1A, L2, or true color TIFF file or 2) three existing loaded bands.        Band List Options Section:       Band number for R band     The number of the loaded band in the  Band List Selection Widget  to use as the red band.        Band number for G band    The number of the loaded band in the  Band List Selection Widget  to use as the green band.        Band number for B band    The number of the loaded band in the  Band List Selection Widget  to use as the blue band.        Slope    The slope to be used to convert the corresponding band data to Byte true color R,G,B band data for display.  (R,G,B band = (Band data - Intercept) / Slope)        Intercept    The intercept to be used to convert the corresponding band data to Byte true color R,G,B band data for display.  (R,G,B band = (Band data - Intercept / Slope)        Input File Options Section:       Input File Type    Currently supported file formats are:  SeaWiFS L1A, L2, and true color TIFF file.        Input File Name    Input file can be selected in one of two ways:       Manually enter a file name.      Press  Select t o select an input file interactively .
