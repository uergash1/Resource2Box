I promise I will ask Ron for this information. It is such a timely article, I wanted to go ahead and share it. Happy Hoofing!      Summertime weather spells potential problems for horses in Georgia and the surrounding south.  Years ago I realized the overall condition of horse feet improved in winter and deteriorated in summer. Let's look at why it happens.   Many barn managers turn out at night during hot weather for obvious reasons: no flies, the sun doesn't bleach hair coats, and frolicking all night keeps them quieter during the day. This summer ""program"" seems very good, yet there is a down side to this regimen of care. During summer evenings, grass is very wet with dew. When horses are out all night their hooves stay wet most of the night. While during the day, the horses are stalled in shavings, worked in sand rings, and generally kept in dry conditions. The exposure to moisture during the night causes the hooves to swell slightly, while during the day moisture evaporates, and they dry out and shrink. The shoes stay the same size throughout. Think about that fact!    To compound the problem, horses have to contend with flies during the day. They in turn stomp their feet.  Foot stomping isnt' so bad if they are shod with stout steel shoes with clips. With the horses wearing training plates (light steel), Queens plates, or aluminum wide webs, a condition may emerge which I call ""Summer Syndrome"". Depending upon the severity of your horse's problems, some trade-off's may be necessary:   1. Eliminate night turn-out, substitute several shorter day periods.   2. Shoe with pads (although pads hold moisture against the sole of the foot, they also keep the moisture constant!).   3. Shoe with steel instead of aluminum. (If your horse moves better in aluminum, then have your farrier spring temper, harden, light steel shoes for summer.)   4. Switch to titanium wide webs during the summer. (Titanium is very hard, yet very light and an excellent replacement for aluminum. Considerably more expensive, yet titanium can be set several more times.)   5. Use fly repellent daily to reduce foot stomping to a minimum.    We have defined the problem, cause and effects, and discussed some mechanical and managerial options as solutions. Now let's look at some topical applications that can help.   I have been shoeing for 30 years and I have tried all the gimmicks and keep coming back to good logic to solve problems. The periople at the coronary band of a horse's hoof secretes a wax-like substance much like what a duck uses on his feathers when preening. On a horse's hoof it is unmistakable. It is the natural, healthy shine we see on barefooted pasture horses. The wax is a way of preserving a moisture balance within the hoof. Naturally! On the other hand, we alter our horse's environment, rasp on their hoof walls, and expose their feet to abrasives, (sand, granite dust, etc.). Obviously, none of these are natural. To compensate, we use hoof dressing, and some are good -- some are useless!  Years ago, I discovered paste floor wax worked as a moisture barrier. But I had my doubts about the compatability of the chemicals with horses' hooves. The best hoof dressing I have found have a high wax content. The four brands that are best formulated to provide hoof seal are:  1. Corona Ointment and Corona Liquified Hoof Dressing by Summit Industries.  2. Hoof Maker by Straight Arrow.  3. Hoof Saver by Farnam  4. Vita-Hoof by Race Horse Veterinary Products.   These products all provide excellent protection against excess moisture in the hooves.   I recommended avoiding petroleum based products in the summer months. These are more soluable in water and attract dirt. Hoof dressings should be applied, then wiped dry (or to a wax-like shine) on the exterior hoof wall. Dressings should be applied more liberally on the sole and the frog of the hoof where most of the moisture is absorbed. Hoof dressings are most effective when used just prior to the night turn-out, hosing, bathing, or anytime your horse's hooves will be exposed to excessive moisture.    We have talked about ""Summer Syndrome"" and its causes. The two questions I am most commonly asked are: ""Does my horse have thrush?"" and ""Are my horse's feet too dry?"" My answer is ""YOUR HORSE'S FEET ARE TOO WET!"" We'll leave the question of thrush for another article.    Obviously, hooves do get too dry in drought conditions or on high ground clay turn-out where there is little grass. This situation is more uncommon than over-moist hooves. It is important that hoof dressings do not soften hooves, at best they maintain moisture already present in the hoof.   When hooves are too dry, we need to provide a source of moisture. The most effective way to do this is to poultice the feet. Poultice powder mixed with water to the consistency of thick oatmeal is best. The poultice can be pre-mixed in a plastic pail and sealed with saran wrap for later use. A hand full applied to each sole of each hoof, then covered with with some type of wrap or poultice boot to keep the moisture securely against the hoof, will provide treatment for the dry hooves. Another way to poultice the feet is to put the mixture into a breadbag or a ziplock bag and slide the hoof into the bag and tape securely around the pastern. A handful of poultice on each foot covered with a square of brown paper will also work (Poultice will stick to the hoof, paper will stick to the poultice but not the bedding). Enough poultice will remain on the hoof to provide necessary moisture. It is best to use poultice when the horse will be confined in a stall for several hours. Hooves will absorb moisture and soften after several days of treatment. Once moisture is regained, then use the wax-based hoof dressing daily to maintain moisture in the hoof.   In conclusion, many factors influence the hoof health factor: nutrition, conformation, hoof substance, farrier care, and stable management. Given all of the above at acceptable levels, moisture content is still critical. Remember, water softens dry hooves and wax maintains the moisture balance.

Eco-Organizing: Domestic Diva, Krista Colvin, Shows You How to Be Green and Gorgeous in 2009                          Written by  Gennefer Snowfield             Published  on January 4th, 2009       1 Comment           Posted  in  Feelgood Style ,   Interviews ,   decor                       One of the biggest challenges most people face is staying organized. It’s also one of the biggest new year’s resolutions for those who resolve to start their new year off clutter-free. But, for many, it’s an elusive process that either starts off strong and fizzles out, or seems so daunting a task that they don’t know where to begin.     Enter  Krista Colvin ,lifestyle expert,Founder of  Organize in Style LLC and creator of  The Shebang , The Smart Woman’s Guide to Doing It All,who seesyour clutter as a canvas for crafting a well organized masterpiece that’s as eco-friendly as it is stylish.Bestof all,she offers practicalsolutions thatare easy to implement — and maintain — and willsave you precious hours to boot. With Krista’s help, the only thing you’ll need to think about is what to do with all that extra time!       »  Read more on Feelgood Style        You are an organizing diva, and manage the Organize in Style blog in addition to creating The Shebang, The Smart Woman’s Guide to Doing it All. How did you get into organizing and what do you love most about it?    After teaching high school for 13 years, I decided to take what I dubbed my “Domestic Diva” leave of absence. A year into it, I got antsy. It was while watching HGTV that I discovered professional organizing as a profession. From there I launched Organize in Style, my consulting and hands-on organizing business then later developed The Shebang!, my online lifestyle management program. I love the instant gratification clients feel, plusexpress. They say thank you immediately vs. my high school students. It usually took them till graduation or their 1st quarter at college!   Why do you think it’s so difficult for people to stay organized? What’s the one main tip you offer clients to help them remain focused in their organizing efforts?   Its difficult to stay organized because we are busy living life to its fullest! We are constantly bringing items into our homesand offices. Think of clutter as just a pile of decisions you have yet to make. The key to staying organized is to make those decisions. Sometimes those decisions are quick and easy while other items require more thought. But make at least some decisions every day.   Is there a secret to being a successful organizer?   Successful organizers create personalized systems for their clients. I believe everyone has their own organizing style and a Stepford approach to organizing just doesnt cut it. I also believe that people are secretly afraid of professional organizers because they think we will throw everything away. Au contraire! We simply press you to answer your own questions i.e.; Do I really need/use/cherish this? Its far from scary and clients quickly comment that its actually fun. I know fun isnt what youd thought, now is it? But its true… I guarantee it!   Your blog talks about how being organized is a lifestyle that can help you effectively manage all areas of your life — and that you can do it in style. Do you have any specific areas on which you focus? What’s the biggest challenge that typically prompts people to seek the services of a professional organizer like you?   The Shebang focuses on getting it, pluskeeping it together amongst all things SHE& self | home | personal/professional endeavors. I believe you can do it all, just not in 1 day or 1 week& but we want to do it all  now . Its the perfectionist in us and the desire for instant gratification. Having a plan takes the overwhelm out of getting organized, and sets you on a course for achieving your goals.   The majority of my new clients call when they are ready to take their business — or their home –to the next level. An entrepreneur may be in their 3rd year of business or have recently moved into a new space. Another client may be fed up with the lack of systems in their home or want to make their space function and look fabulous. But the biggest issue is always paper& paper, paper, paper. “Help! I’m drowning in paper!”   Our readers embrace a green lifestyle. Do your services include eco-friendly tips and tricks for organizing stylishly — and responsibly?   The first step is getting to know the clients organizing — and personal  style. Then comes the fun part — getting creative with the use of out of the box storage items. I love using vintage items to organize. A tea cup can serve as a paperclip holder. An old metal cash box can become a bill box.” Look for items that can be used for incoming mail or magazine and catalog holders. An old bread box can be a clever way to hide your kitchen office clutter –i.e. pens, scissor, pad of paper etc. I did a  segment  on organizing with vintage items that offers more great tips as part of a reuse/recycle approach to organizing.   What green organizing tips can you share? Is this a big part of your business?   Being green is integrated intomy basic organizingprocess:   Know what youve got.   I love it when a client says happily, Ive been looking for that. Tts much better than hearing Dang, I couldnt find this so I bought a new one last week.   Use what you have.   Gather up all the  full shampoos, gels, etc. Place them in a shower caddy and use them up. Try to see how many meals you can conjure up with the food in your fridge, freezer, and pantry.   Make a “love it or leave it” basket.   Your girlfriends or babysitter may love the smell of the lotion you loathe or adore the stationary you no longer fancy. Give them easy access and feel good about your decision to let it go.   Spread the love.   The old camera, old phone, old sheets, and so on and so on are perfectly good, but they arent good to anyone sitting in the closet. Pick your favorite charitable recipient and make a monthly visit.   Isnt that lovely?”   Get in the habit of not bringing the “lovelies” home. Instead, try picking up the item, and in your best sweet drawl, utter adoringly,oh, isnt that lovely then gently placing it back down and keep smiling as you walk away!   What are some of the benefits of being organized? What areas of the house do you think offer the greatest benefits?   Being organized allows you to dream big dreams! Once youve got the little things under control, you can tackle the big items that come your way. And of course, save oodles of time and money.   Think of the areas you use on a daily basis. Organize these first and youll free up time while feeling less anxious. Mail centers and often used spaces like the bathroom, kitchen andpantry fall into this category.   Your services extend beyond basic room organization to crafts and meal planning — and even TO DO lists and entertaining. Why did you decide to take this comprehensive approach? Do clients engage you for specific services or do you offer a total package?   After completing projects with clients, I realized they were anxious to keep their spaces looking and feeling fabulous and functional. They wanted a plan. An  easy  plan. Its not just stuff that overwhelms people… its life, the over committing, the perfection misconception, and trying to entertain on a 5-star level. Having a plan where you know you will focus on all these areas in a particular time frame — and with a particular,  achievable –  goal in mindwill take a majority of the stress out of it.   Most projects begin with a consultation which includes creating an overall plan for their space. Together, we determine where to start and where my help is most needed vs. the DIY list. I prefer to focus on one area at a time, allowing the client time to adjust to, and feel comfortable managing,the newly implemented system.   Are there certain times of the year (like New Year’s!) or life events (such as getting married, moving etc.) that prompt people to contact you? Do you have a particular time of year or life event that you recommend is a good time to start getting organized that offers the greatest chance of sticking with it?     Im not sure if its the media hype or the fact that we are so over all the holiday dcor that creates the New Year organizing craze. But its definitely a time when people are seeking information. About 2 weeks into January, the calls really start flooding in. People just want it done and don’t have the time or patience for the DIY phase. Transitional periods, whether it be moving or having a 2nd child or taking a business to the next , typically prompts a majority ofcalls.   But anytime is a good time to start. Your success depends on the system youve chosen to implement. The more simple the system the more likely you are to stick with it.         What’s your dream organizing job? Do you have visions of being the next Martha Stewart? Where do you hope to take your expertise?   Ooooh, my dream job. Id love to consult with builders and have them implement my savvy storage solutions into their homes, and feature them in the models.   As far as being Martha Stewart, I did before I had kids! Now Im much more Erma (as in Bombeck) sprinkled with a touch of Martha glitter. Visions of Martha make me feel like I need to be perfect and frankly, I lock my keys in my car every so often so I just aim to be the best  me !   Id love to design organizing products and have my own little cable show. The products would be functional and fabulous and the show& well, it would have to include coffeeand my girlfriends, two of the essentials I can not live without. Oh, and lipstick!   If readers could only focus on ONE organizing effort in 2009, what would you recommend it be?     Create simple routines andschedules&not necessarily to be so rigid andfollowed to a T but as a base for staying sane!   How can readers get in touch with you if they want to contract your services?

clueweb09-en0002-38-17927	   TopEndSports     home  |   testing  |  fitness     This is the mobile version of the website. Go here for the complete   Topendsports.com  site    Sit and Reach Flexibility    This test measures the flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles.             equipment required:  sit and reach box (or alternatively a ruler can    be used, and held between the feet)          description / procedure:  This test involves sitting        on the floor with legs out straight ahead. Feet (shoes off) are        placed with the soles flat against the box, shoulder-width apart. Both knees are held flat against        the floor by the tester. With hands on top  of each other and  palms facing down, the subject reaches forward along the  measuring line as far as possible. After three practice reaches, the fourth  reach is held for at least two seconds while the distance is recorded.  Make        sure there is no jerky movements, and that the fingertips remain    level and the legs flat.     scoring:  The score is recorded to the nearest centimeter as the distance before      (negative) or beyond (positive) the toes. Rating   scores (in cm) for adults, using zero at the level of the feet, are for males > +17 excellent, +6 to +16 good, 0 to +5 average, -8 to -1 fair, -19 to -9 poor and < -20 very poor. For females, > +21 excellent, +11 to +20 good, +1 to +10 average, -7 to 0 fair, -14 to -8 poor and < -15 very poor.          validity:  This tests only measures the flexibility of      the lower back and hamstrings, and is a valid measure of this.           reliability:  The reliability will depends on the amount      of warm-up allowed, and whether the same procedures are followed      each time. Most norms are based on no previous warm-up, though the best results will be achieved after a warm up or if the test is proceeded by a test such as the endurance test.          advantages:  This is the most commonly used test of flexibility,      so there is lots of data for comparison. Also, it is a       easy and quick test to perform.          disadvantages:  Variations in arm, leg and trunk length      can make comparisons between individuals misleading. The best measures are made with a measurement box specifically made for this test, which is not readily available.  This test is specific to the range of motion and muscles and joints of the lower back and hamstrings.           other comments:  Lower back flexibility is important      because tightness in this area is implicated in lumbar lordosis,      forward pelvic tilt and lower back pain.     back to  fitness test database     (7) Home    |  (8) Testing  |  (9) Fitness            
clueweb09-enwp01-56-17042	"                     Horse hoof          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2008)                 This article  may require  cleanup  to meet Wikipedia's  quality standards .  Please  improve this article  if you can.  (January 2009)              Barefoot hoof, lateral view. Cornet band (1), walls (2), toe (3), quarter (4), heel (5), bulb (6), P2 (small pastern) (7)       A  horse hoof  is a structure surrounding the distal  phalanx  of the 3rd digit (digit III of the basic  pentadactyl limb  of  vertebrates , evolved into a single weight-bearing digit in equids) of each of the four limbs of  Equus  species, which is covered by complex soft tissue and  keratinised  (cornified) structures. Since a single digit must bear the full proportion of the animal's weight that is borne by that limb, the hoof is of vital importance to the horse. The phrase ""no hoof, no horse"" underlines how much the health and the strength of the hoof is crucial for horse soundness.   Both wild and feral equid hooves have enormous strength and resilience, allowing any gait on any ground. A common example of the feral horse type is the  Mustang . The Mustang is, in part, descended from the  Iberian horses  brought to the Americas by the  Spanish , but most herds also have ancestry from other breeds. Therefore, the famous mustang hoof strength is in part a result of  natural selection  and environment. Thus, it is possible that other domestic breeds could develop similar hooves if raised under similar conditions.   The recent  barefoot movement  claims that such a strength can be almost completely restored to domesticated horses, when appropriate trimming and living conditions are applied, to such an extent that  horseshoes  are no longer necessary in almost any horse. This is not an unopposed view but, if true, would undermine the belief that ""the horseshoe is a necessary evil.""

Details: heel perioplium (1), bulb (2), frog (3), central groove (4), collateral groove (5), heel (6), bar (7), seat of corn (8), pigmented walls (external layer) (9), water line (inner layer) (10), white line (11), apex of frog (12), sole (13), toe (14), how to measure width (15), quarter (16), how to measure length (17)       The hoof is made up by an outer part, the hoof capsule (composed of various cornified specialised structures) and an inner, living part, containing soft tissues and bone. The cornified material of the hoof capsule is different in structure and properties in different parts. Dorsally, it covers, protects and supports P3 (also known as the coffin bone,  pedal bone , PIII). Palmarly/plantarly, it covers and protects specialised soft tissues (tendons, ligaments, fibro-fatty and/or fibrocartilaginous tissues and cartilage). The upper, almost circular limit of the hoof capsule is the coronet (coronary band), having an angle to the ground of roughly similar magnitude in each pair of feet (i.e. fronts and backs). These angles may differ slightly from one horse to the other but not markedly. The walls originate from the coronet band. Walls are longer in the dorsal portion of the hoof (toe), intermediate in length in the lateral portion (quarter) and very short in palmar/plantar portion (heel). Heels are separated by an elastic, resilient structure named the 'frog'. In the palmar/plantar part of the foot, above the heels and the frog, there are two oval bulges named the 'bulbs'.   When you pick up the hoof and you look at its lower surface, you can see the wall's free margin, encircling most of the hoof. In the central area, you can see the triangular frog. Lateral to the frog, are two grooves, deeper in their posterior portion, named 'collateral grooves'. At the heels, the palmar/plantar portion of the walls bend inwards sharply, following the external surface of collateral grooves; here they are named bars. The lower surface of the hoof, from the outer walls and the inner frog and bars, is covered by an exfoliating keratinised material, called the 'sole'.   Just below the coronet, the walls are covered for about an inch by a cornified, opaque material named the 'periople'. In the palmar/plantar part of the hoof, the periople is thicker and more rubbery over the heels and it merges with frog material. Not all horses have the same amount of periople. Dry feet tend to lack this substance, which can be substituted with Hoof Dressing.     [ edit ]   Characters and functions of the external hoof structures          A horse's hoof being leveled by a  farrier  who is using a  rasp .         [ edit ]   The walls   The walls are to be considered both as a protective shield, covering the sensitive internal hoof tissues, just like the  exoskeleton  of  arthropods , and as a structure devoted to dissipating the energy of concussion and to provide grip on different terrains. They are elastic and very tough, similar to a teflon layer; its thickness is approximately 6 mm - 12 mm. The walls are composed of three distinct layers: the pigmented layer, the water line and the white line.   The  pigmented layer  is generated by the coronet and its color is just like that of the coronet skin whence it is derived. If the coronet skin has any dark patch, the walls show a parallel pigmented line, from the coronet to the ground, showing the wall's growth direction. This layer has a prevalent protective role and is not so resistant to ground contact, where it can break and flake away.   The  water line  is built up by the coronet and by the wall's corium (the living tissue immediately beneath the walls). Its thickness increases proportional to the distance from the coronet and, in the lower third of the walls, is thicker than the pigmented layer. It is very resistant to contact to the ground and it serves a mainly support function.   The  white line  is the inner layer of the wall. It is softer and fibrous in structure. Its color is yellowish. You can see it in the underside of the healthy hoof as a thin line joining the sole and the walls. The white line grows out from the laminar connections. Any visible derangement of the white line indicates some important derangement of laminar connections that fix the walls to the underlying P3 bone. Since the white line is softer than both the walls and the sole, it wears fast where it appears on the surface and it appears as a subtle groove between the sole and the walls, often with some debris or sand inside.   The three layers of the wall merge in a single mass and they grow downwards together. If the wall doesn't wear naturally, from sufficient movement on abrasive terrains, then it will protrude from the solar surface. It then becomes prone to breakage and the healthy hoof will self-trim, by breaking or chipping off.   When a horseshoe is applied, it is fixed to the wall. Nails are driven in, oblique to the walls. They enter the wall at the outside edge of the white line and they emerge at the wall's surface, approximately 15-20 mm from the base of the wall.   The wall is anatomically analogous to the human finger or toe nail.     [ edit ]   The frog   The  frog  is a heart shaped structure that extends forwards across about two-thirds of the sole. Its thickness grows from the front to the back and, at the back, it merges with the heel periople. In its midline, it has a groove, the central groove (sulcus), that extends up between the bulbs.   It is dark gray-blackish in color and of a rubbery consistency, suggesting its role as shock absorber and grip tool on hard, smooth ground. Actually, the frog acts like a pump to move the blood back to the heart, a great distance from the relatively thin leg to the main organ of the circulatory system.   In the stabled horse, the frog doesn't wear but it degrades with bacterial and fungal activity to an irregular, soft, slashed surface. In the free-roaming horse, it hardens into a callous consistency with a near-smooth surface.   It is anatomically analogous to the human fingertip.     [ edit ]   The sole   The sole has a whitish-yellowish, sometimes grayish color. It covers the whole space from the perimeter of the wall to the bars and the frog, on the underside of the hoof. Its deep layer has a compact, waxy character and it is called 'live sole'. Its surface is variable in character as a result of ground contact. If there is no contact, as in shod hooves or when the walls are too long or the movement poor, the lower surface of the sole has a crumbly consistency and it is easily abraded by scratching it with a hoofpick. Conversely, it has a very hard consistency, with a smooth, bright surface when there is a consistent, active contact with the ground. The front portion beneath the front of the pedal bone is called the 'sole callus'.     [ edit ]   The bars   They are inward folds of the wall, originating from the heels at an abrupt angle. The strong structure built up by the extremity of the heel and of the bar is named the 'heel buttress'. The sole between the heel walls and the bars is named the 'seat of corn' and it is a very important landmark used by natural hoof trimmers to evaluate the correct heel height. The bars have a three-layer structure, just like the walls (see above). When overgrown, they bend outwards and cover the lower surface of the sole.     [ edit ]   Internal structures          Sagittal section of a wild horsehoof. Pink: soft tissues; light gray: bones (P2, P3 and navicular bone); blue: tendons; red: corium; yellow: digital cushion; dark gray: frog; orange: sole; brown: walls)       The third phalanx (coffin bone;  pedal bone ; P3;) is completely (or almost completely) covered by the hoof capsule. It has a crescent shape and a lower cup-like concavity. Its external surface mirrors the wall's shape. The corium, a dermo-epidermal, highly vascularized layer between the wall and the coffin bone, has a parallel, laminar shape and is named the  laminae.  Laminar connection has a key role in the strength and the health of the hoof. Beneath the rear part of the sole, there is the  digital cushion,  which separates the frog and the bulb from underlying tendons, joints and bones, providing cushioning protection. In the foal and in the colt, the digital cushion is composed of fibro-fatty, soft tissue. In the adult horse it hardens into a fibrocartilagineous tissue, when sufficient, consistent concussion stimulates the back of the hoof. Normal transformation of the digital cushion into fibrocartilagineous tissue is now considered a key goal, both for prevention of  navicular syndrome  and for rehabilitation of recovering cases  [1] . The flexor tendon lays deeper, just along the posterior surface of the small pastern bone (PII) and navicular bone and it connects with posterior surface of P3, the navicular functioning as a pulley.     [ edit ]   The hoof mechanism          Bare hooves imprints on the snow. Left, a front print, right, a hind print; note the different shape and the wide contact with the ground       The horse hoof is not at all a rigid structure. It is elastic and flexible. Just squeezing the heels by hand will demonstrate that. When loaded, the hoof physiologically changes its shape. In part, this is a result of solar concavity, which has a variable depth, in the region of 1 - 1.5 cm. In part, it is a result of the arched shape of the lateral lower profile of the walls and sole, so that when an unloaded hoof touches a firm ground surface, there is only contact at toe and heels (active contact). A loaded hoof has a much greater area of ground contact (passive contact), covering the lower wall edge, most of the sole, bars and frog. Active contact areas can be seen as slightly protruding spots in the walls and in the callused sole.   The shape changes in a loaded hoof are complex. The plantar arch flattens, the solar concavity decreases in depth and heels spread. The hoof diameter increases to a 'dilated' configuration and P3 drops marginally into the hoof capsule. There is some recent evidence that a depression takes place in this phase, with blood pooling ('diastolic phase') mainly into the wall's corium. When unloaded, the hoof restores its 'contracted' configuration, the pressure raises and the blood is squeezed out ('systolic phase'). There is a secondary pumping action, with the flexion of the foot, as it is raised.   The hoof mechanism ensures an effective blood circulation into the hoof, and it aids general circulation, too.     [ edit ]   Time-related changes of the hoof   Hooves have to be considered as a plastic structure and their time-related, very complex changes can be considered in the short term (days/weeks), in the medium term (the horse's lifespan) and in the long term (the evolution of equids).     [ edit ]   Hoof changes in the short term   Just like the cornified layer of epidermis and of any mammal nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living layer of the skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by  mitotic  activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.   Thus, the specialised cornified structures of the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall doesn't exfoliate at all, It is constantly growing downward (about 1 cm per month) and self-trims by ground contact by wearing or by chipping, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and usual ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming the walls and the frog and scraping off the dead sole.     [ edit ]   Hoof changes in the medium term   Front and hind hooves are identical in the foal but differ visibly in the adult horse. This is good evidence of medium-term plasticity of the whole hoof shape, as a result of variation in its use. Slow changes in hoof shape occur under any consistent change in the horse's movement pattern and under a wide variety of pathological conditions. They can be seen now as a clear example of a  complex adaptive system , a frequent feature of living beings and structures.   Self-adapting capabilities of the hooves show their maximal effectiveness in wild equids (but domesticated horses show this too, to a lesser extent), as shown by the perfect soundness of feral horses, such as  mustangs , in a wide variety of environments.     [ edit ]   Hoof changes in the long term   Equid hooves are the result of the 50-million-year  evolution of the horse . Wild and domesticated equus species share a very similar hoof shape and function. The present-day conformation of the hoof is a result of a progressive evolutionary loss of digits I, II, IV and V of the basal pentadactyl limb, with changes in bones, joints and hoof capsule. The resulting conformation allows a heavy, strong body to move with high speed on any ground, most efficiently on open, hard, flat areas like prairies and deserts (i.e. 'cursorial specialisation').

Heated seats, air dry, etc.                     Bath Lift                    Bidet Toilet      A bidet is a toilet-like invention that is mainly used to wash and clean the genitals and the other areas near these. Bidet is a device usually situated next to a toilet. It is sometimes mistaken to be a toilet or a urinal or even a drinking fountain by those unfamiliar to it. But one should be aware that a bidet is to be used only, right after using the toilet. Its purpose is to wash and clean and nothing more. Also, bidet is not solely for cleaning the genitals alone. It can also be used for other hygienic purposes.    Having a bidet is a great help for those who have physical disabilities, mobility problems and other related problems. A bidet produces an arc of water through a faucet-like device attached to it that leaves the user relaxed and cleaned and free from any excessive movement. According to health experts, a bidet is more effective in cleaning than toilet paper. And that it also helps prevent urinary tract infections and other ailments caused by poor hygiene.    There are different designs of bidets that are becoming more popular in the contemporary times. A bidet can be attached to the toilet itself or it can be a separate one. When a bidet is a part of a toilet, it can only be used as an instrument for cleaning the genitals. This type sometimes has two nozzles: the family nozzle and the bidet nozzle. The family nozzle is basically used to clean the area o the anus, while the bidet nozzle is used to clean the females vulva. There is also the existence of a more advanced kind of bidet known as bidet attachments. These are often used in hospitals for they have been proved to be highly commendable when it comes to maintaining personal hygiene.

A  tickler file  is a collection of date-labeled file folders organized in a way that allows time-sensitive documents to be filed according to the future date on which each document needs action. Documents within the folders of a tickler file can be to-do lists, pending bills, unpaid invoices, travel tickets, hotel reservations, meeting information, birthday reminders, coupons, claim tickets, call-back notes, follow-up reminders, maintenance reminders, or any other papers that require future action. Each day, the folder having the current date is retrieved from the tickler file so that any documents within it may be acted on. Essentially, a tickler file provides a way to send a reminder to oneself in the future"" tickling "" one's  memory .   Tickler  files  are often used in newsrooms by  editing ,  journalists , and  reporters , as well as by many other groups, including  sales representatives  and  professional offices  in  medicine ,  law ,  non-profit ,  government , and  accounting .   A tickler file system also has other applications such as museum guides, specialized fact books, time management software, or any organized arrangement of information to which a person may want quick access.           Contents       1   History   2   43 divisions   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   One common implementation was in law offices in the early twentieth century, if not before, where small task cards or ""tickler cards"" would be filed by date and then distributed to lawyers as legal tasks such as renewal of trademarks, updating of wills and filing of motions for a particular case would be approaching. In larger firms a single person would be assigned the maintenance and follow-up of this file, distributing tasks and ensuring their follow-up, which could be recorded on the cards for billing and documentation.   More recently the concept was re-introduced to popular culture through various  self-help  books as Pam Young and Peggy Jones' 1977 book  Sidetracked Home Executives: From Pig-Pen to Paradise ,  FlyLady  Maria Ciley, Chris Crouch's book  Getting Organized ,  David Allen 's 2002 book  Getting Things Done  and  Merlin Mann's  website ""43 Folders,"" whose name comes from one popular method for maintaining a tickler file.     [ edit ]   43 divisions   In larger, institutional uses a tickler file would be chronological, with one section for each year or day, sometimes encompassing more than a century in as much detail as appropriate (especially for dates far in the future). A more common technique is to have index cards with forty-three dividers or a system with forty-three folders or two accordion files. The forty-three divisions  (31+12 = 43)  come from a maximum thirty-one days in a  Gregorian  or  Julian   month  and twelve months in a year. When something is scheduled for the coming month, it is placed within the appropriate daily section. Items which need to be done in a particular month are placed in one of the corresponding monthly folder, to be distributed in days near the beginning of that month. Tasks which are not completed may be moved to a different folder or kept in position to be revisited in the following month or year.   Simple systems which involve many repetitive tasks over time tend to use and re-use index cards of an appropriate size, with more complex systems using expandible ""accordion files,"" file folders or even entire rooms full of filing cabinets. Modern systems are usually maintained in computerized  databases  or with simple tools such as a Unix "".calendar"" file.

Look up  spa ,  Spa ,  SpA  in  Wiktionary , the free dictionary.     This article is about the therapeutic spa.  For other uses, see  Spa (disambiguation) .   The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment. The term thus has various related meanings.           Contents       1   Origins of the term   2   History     2.1   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   2.2   Bathing in Medieval times   2.3   Bathing in the 18th century   2.4   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   2.5   Spas in colonial America   2.6   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America       3   Spa meaning a resort or place of treatment   4   Spa medication or equipment   5   International Spa Association definitions     5.1   Types of spa       6   Notes   7   External links               [ edit ]   Origins of the term   See also:  Mineral spa   The term is derived from the name of the town of  Spa, Belgium , whose name is known back to Roman times, when the location was called Aquae Spadanae,  [ 1 ]  perhaps related to the  Latin  word ""spagere"" meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. [ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]   Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing   The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

                         What is Tennis Elbow ?     Tennis elbow is an injury to the muscles and tendons on the outside (lateral aspect) of the elbow that results from overuse or repetitive stress. The narrowing of the muscle bellies of the forearm as they merge into the tendons create highly focused stress where they insert into the bone of the elbow.           Mechanism of Injury        Lateral epicondylitis        Injury to the lateral aspect of the elbow is the most common upper extremity tennis injury. Tennis elbow is generally caused by overuse of the extensor tendons of the forearm, particularly the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Commonly experienced by the amateur player, this injury is often a result of (1) a one-handed backhand with poor technique (the ball is hit with the front of the shoulder up and power generated from the forearm muscles), (2) a late forehand swing preparation with resulting wrist snap to bring the racquet head perpendicular to the ball, or (3) while serving, the ball is hit with full power and speed with wrist pronation (palm turned downward) and wrist snap which increases the stress on the already taught extensor tendons.      Medial epicondylitis       Medial epicondylitis is less common and  characteristically occurs with wrist flexor activity and pronation. Medial epicondylitis can result from (1) late forehand biomechanics where the player quickly snaps the wrist to bring the racquet head forward, (2) the back-scratch or cocking phase when serving, which places tremendous stress on the medial tissues of the elbow, (3) in the right elbow of a right-handed golf swing by throwing the club head down at the ball with the right arm rather than pulling the club through with the left arm and trunk (also referred to as ""golfers elbow""), or (4) improper pulling technique with certain swim strokes, especially the backstroke (also referred to as ""swimmers elbow"").     It should be kept in mind that elbow epicondylitis is not limited to those persons playing tennis, golf, baseball or swimming and can result from any activity that puts the lateral or medial compartments of the elbow under similar repetitive stress and strain (e.g., hammering, turning a key, screw driver use, computer work, excessive hand shaking).          Signs and Symptoms    General      difficulty holding onto, pinching, or gripping objects   pain, stiffness, or insufficient elbow and hand movement   forearm muscle tightness   insufficient forearm functional strength   point tenderness at or near the insertion sites of the muscles of the lateral or medial elbow       Specific          Lateral Epicondylitis     Medial Epicondylitis            painful resisted wrist extension         painful resisted wrist flexion            painful resisted radial deviation            (bending wrist toward pinky)        painful resisted forearm pronation               (palm facing downward)            palpation tenderness of the lateral epicondyle         palpation tenderness of the medial epicondyle               Rehabilitation -  What You Can Expect   Epicondylitis, both medial and lateral, is a common and often lingering pathologic condition. It is critical, therefore, that you progress your rehabilitation only when you experience minimal or no pain. For more on when and how to progress, see below.   As a general guideline, the more chronic or longer you have experienced the condition, the longer the recovery time is to be expected (up to 8 weeks).          Rehabilitation -  What should I do, when should I do it, and how?   Epicondylitis often becomes a chronic problem if not cared for properly. For this reason, it must be stressed that the rehabilitation process should not be progressed until you experience little or no pain at the level you are performing. Regaining full strength and flexibility is critical before returning to your previous level of sports activity.   In general, the rehabilitation process can be divided into three phases:      PHASE 1     Goals:  decrease inflammation and pain, promote tissue healing, and retard muscle atrophy. During the acute stage of your injury, whether the medial or lateral elbow is affected, follow the  RICE  principle:       R est - this means avoiding further overuse not absence of activity. You should maintain as high an activity level as possible while avoiding activities that aggravate the injury. Absolute rest should be avoided as it encourages muscle atrophy, deconditions tissue, and decreases blood supply to the area, all of which is detrimental to the healing process. Pain is the best guide to determine the appropriate type and level of activity.      I ce - is recommended as long as inflammation is present. This may mean throughout the entire rehabilitation process and return to sports. Ice decreases the inflammatory process slows local metabolism and helps relieve pain and muscle spasm.      C ompress and  E levate if appropriate to assist venous return and minimize swelling.          PHASE 2      Goals:  Improve flexibility, increase strength and endurance, increase functional activities and return to function.              Stretching        Gentle stretching exercises including wrist flexion, extension and rotation. The elbow should be extended and not flexed to increase the amount of stretch as required. These stretches should be held for 20-30 seconds and repeated 5-10 times, at least twice a day. Vigorous stretching should be avoided - do not stretch to the point of pain that reproduces your symptoms.        Strengthening        With the elbow bent and the wrist supported perform the following exercises:      Wrist Extension.  Place 1 lb. weight in hand with palm facing downward (pronated); support forearm at the edge of a table or on your knee so that only your hand can move. Raise wrist/hand up slowly (concentric contraction), and lower slowly (eccentric contraction).              Wrist Flexion.  Place 1 lb. weight in hand with palm facing upward (supinated); support forearm at the edge of a table or on your knee so that only your hand can move. Bend wrist up slowly (concentric), and then lower slowly (eccentric)(similar to exercise above).    Combined Flexion/Extension.  Attach one end of a string to a cut broom stick or similar device, attach the other end to a weight. In standing, extend your arms and elbows straight out in front of you. Roll the weight up from the ground by turning the wrists. Flexors are worked with the palms facing upward. Extensors are worked with the palms facing downward.    Forearm Pronation/Supination.  Grasp hammer (wrench, or some similar device) in hand with forearm supported. Rotate hand to palm down position, return to start position (hammer perpendicular to floor), rotate to palm up position, repeat. To increase or decrease resistance, by move hand farther away or closer towards the head of the hammer.               Finger Extension.  Place a rubber band around all five finger tips. Spread fingers 25 times, repeat 3 times. If resistance is not enough, add a second rubber band or use a rubber band of greater thickness which will provide more resistance.       Ball Squeeze.  Place rubber ball or tennis ball in palm of hand, squeeze 25 times, repeat 3 times. If pain is reproduced squeeze a folded sponge or piece of foam.           For all of the exercises (except combined flexion\extension) perform 10 repetitions 3-5 times a day. With the combined flexion/extension perform until you feel fatigue. With all exercises use pain as your guide - all exercises should be pain free.        When to progress.  Begin with a 1 lb. weight and perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions. When this becomes easy, work up to 15 repetitions. Increase the weight only when you can complete 15 repetitions 3 times without difficulty. The axiom ""No Pain No Gain"" does  NOT  apply here.    After exercising, massage across the area of tenderness with an ice cube for about 5 minutes. You might also try filling a paper cup half-full with water and freeze; peel back a portion of the paper cup to expose the ice.      PHASE 3     Goals:  Improve muscular strength and endurance, maintain and improve flexibility, and gradually return to prior level of sport or high level activity.       Continue the stretching and strengthening exercises emphasizing the eccentric contractions of wrist flexion and extension. In this regard, since the eccentric contractions are movements with gravity, do not let the weight drop too quickly; lower the weight in a controlled fashion. With the combined wrist flexion/extension exercise, work on increasing speed when rolling up the string with the attached weight as this will improve endurance.       When your symptoms are resolved and have regained full range of motion and strength, you may gradually increase your level of playing activity. An example of one gradual progressive return to tennis is as follows:               Lateral Epicondylitis       Medial Epicondylitis               15 minutes forehand only       15 minutes backhand and lobs                 30 minutes forehand only         30 minutes backhand and lobs                  30 minutes forehand and two handed backhand          30 minutes backhand, lobs, forehand (no top spin)                45 minutes forehand and backhand        45 minutes backhand, lobs, forehand                45 minutes all strokes        45 minutes all stokes                Serve        Serve                Full play        Full play                Competitive play        Competitive play                     The Scoop on  Bracing     Lateral counter-force bracing is believed to reduce the magnitude of muscle contraction which in turn reduces the degree of muscle tension in the region of muscular attachment. The counter-force brace is essentially an inelastic cuff that is worn around the proximal (near) forearm (against the forearm extensors for lateral epicondylitis and around the forearm flexors for medial epicondylitis).     In theory, the brace constrains full muscle expansion when the muscle contracts, diminishes muscle activity, and therefore the force generated by the muscle. An analogy is the fret on a guitar; when you exert pressure on a different fret along the neck of the guitar, it changes and reduces the tension on the guitar string above where the pressure is exerted.   The  counter-force brace can be worn beginning in Phase 2 of your rehabilitation program. However, adhere to the following caution:  do not become dependent on the counter-force brace and gradually wean yourself off its use during Phase 3. Counter-force bracing is a supplement to, not a replacement for your rehabilitation program.          Equipment Modifications   Using the wrong tennis racquet may have been a contributing factor to your injury. Guidelines for racquet selection for non-tournament players are provided below.     Racquet material  - Graphite composites are currently considered the best in terms of torsion and vibration control.    Head size  - A midsize racquet (95-110 square inches) is preferred. The popular oversized racquets cause problems because they make the arm susceptible to injury due to the increased torque effect of shots hit off-center.    String tension  - stay at the lower end of the manufacturer's recommendation. While higher string tensions provide improved ball control, it also increases the torque and vibration experienced by the arm.    Stringing material  - synthetic nylon (re-string every 6 months).    Grip size  - A grip too large or too small lessens control and promotes excessive wrist movement. To measure an appropriate grip size for your hand see image below.

Sit in the middle of the seat, with your feet shoulder width apart. You may place one foot  slightly  ahead of the other. Cross your arms at the wrists and hold them close to your chest. Stand completely up, then completely down. You can use your arms for assistance or for safety if you need. Count the number of chair stands you can complete in 30 seconds, your goal is to do at least 8 chair stands or more. If you perform less than 8, you may be at risk for losing the ability to perform activities that depend on leg strength.       Senior Fitness Test II - Arm Curl Test:    Assesses upper body strength and endurance   Use a 5 pound weight for women and an 8 pound weight for men. Chose a chair without armrests. Determine which arm is stronger and sit near that side of the chair. Hold the weight in your stronger hand using a suitcase grip with your arm in a down position beside the chair. Brace the upper arm against the body so that only the lower arm is moving. Curl your arm up through a full range of motion, gradually turning the palm up. As you lower your arm through the full range of motion, gradually return to the suitcase grip. Be sure to fully bend and then fully straighten the elbow. It's important that the upper arm is stable throughout the test, and doesn't swing. Count how many controlled arm curls you can perform in 30 seconds, your goal is 11 or more arm curls.  Less then 11 curls indicates that you may be at risk for losing the ability to perform activities that require arm strength.               Senior Fitness Test III - Chair Sit and Reach Test:    Assesses your lower body flexibility         You'll need a ruler and a partner to help you measure. Sit at the front edge of a straight back or folding chair placed against a wall for safety.  Keep one foot flat on the floor, extend the other leg forward knee straight, heel on the floor, ankle bent at 90°. Place one hand on top of the other with tips of the middle fingers even. Inhale, and as you exhale, reach toward your toe by bending at your hip. Keep your back straight and head up. Avoid bouncing or quick movements, and never stretch to the point of pain. Keep the knee straight, and hold the reach for 2 seconds. Your partner measures the distance between your fingertips and your toe to the nearest inch. If you reach your toe, score zero. If you don't reach your toe, score a negative distance, such as 3 inches; if you reach beyond your toe, score a positive distance, such as + 1 inch. Your goal is to reach at least 2 inches away from your toe for women and 4 inches for men.  If you are unable to meet this goal, you may need assistance with activities that require lower body flexibility. This test should not be done if you have severe Osteoporosis.           Senior Fitness Test IV - 8-Foot Up and Go:    Assesses speed, agility and balance while moving     You'll need a partner to time you. Use a stop watch for greatest accuracy. Place a straight back or folding chair next to a wall for safety and a cone or similar marker 8 feet from the chair. Make sure there's an unobstructed path from the chair around the marker. Begin fully seated. When your partner says, ""Go,"" stand and walk (don't run) as quickly as you can safely move around the cone, return to the chair, and sit down. If you normally use a cane or walker, it is OK to use it for the test. You are timed from the instant your partner says, ""Go,"" until you sit back down. For best results, practice the test once, and then perform it twice. Take your best score. Your goal is to perform the test in 9 seconds or less. If it takes you longer than this, you may require assistance to move from one place to another safely.         Senior Fitness Test V - Scratch Test:    Measures upper body flexibility     You'll need a ruler or a yardstick. Place your hand over your shoulder, and reach as far as possible down the middle of your back, your palm touching your body. Place your other arm behind your back, palm facing outward and reach up as far as possible attempting to touch or overlap the middle fingers of both hands. Practice two times, and then test two times. Your partner measures the distance between the tips of the middle fingers to the nearest half-inch. If the fingertips touch, score zero. If they do not touch, score a negative distance, such as 2 inches; if they overlap, score a positive distance, such as + 1 inch. Take your best score. For women the goal is to have your fingertips no more than 5 inches apart and for men no more that 8 inches apart. If you're unable to reach this goal, you may be at risk for losing the ability to perform some activities that require upper body flexibility. Stop the test if you experience pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SIT AND BE FIT "" P.O.

Both have the same amount of calories. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams.             Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study.             Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods. Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because            they are added!             Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods.             Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around forless than 100 years.                     Now for Margarine...                       Very high in Trans Fatty Acids... Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease..             Increases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol)             Lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol) .... Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold...             Lowers quality of breast milk ... Decreases immune response...             Decreases insulin response. And here is the most disturbing fact....                     Here Is the Part That Is Very Interesting!           Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC...This fact alone was enough to have me avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is          hydrogenated (this means hydrogen is added, changing the molecular structure of the substance).           YOU can try this yourself: purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or shaded area. Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things: no          flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it (that should tell you something) ... it does not rot or smell differently .. because it has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on          it ... even those teeny weeny microorganisms will not a find a home to grow.           Why? Because it is nearly plastic.           Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast?

Geese Fact: As each goose flaps its wings, it creates an ""uplift"" for the other birds to follow. By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock adds 70% greater            flying range than if each bird flew alone.                                  Our Lesson: People who share a common direction and a sense of community get where they are going quicker and easier -- because they are traveling on the thrust of            one another.                                  Geese Fact: When a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of flying alone. It quickly moves back into formation to take advantage of            the lifting power of the bird immediately in front of it.                                  Our Lesson: If we have as much sense as a goose, we stay in formation with those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and give our help to            others.                                  Geese Fact: When a goose tires, it rotates to the back of the formation as another goose flies to the point opposite.                                  Our Lesson: It pays to take turns doing the hard tasks and sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent on each other's skills, capabilities and            unique arrangement of gifts, talents or resources.                                  Geese Fact: The geese flying in formation honk to encourage those up front to keep up their speed.                                  Our Lesson: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups -- where there is encouragement to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the same            in others -- is the sort of honking we seek.                                  Geese Fact: When a goose gets sick, wounded or shot down, two geese drop out of formation and follow it down to help and protect it. They stay with it until it dies            or is able to fly again. Then they launch out in formation and try to catch the flock.                                  Our Lesson: If we had as much sense as geese, we would stand by each other in difficult times as well as when we are strong.

Just in case you weren't feeling old enough today, this          will certainly change things. Each year the staff at Beloit College in Wisconsin puts together a list to try to give the Faculty a sense of the mindset of this year's incoming freshman.           Here is this year's list:                       The people who are starting college this fall across the nation were born in 1985.             They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan Era and probably did not know he had ever been shot.             They were prepubescent when the Persian Gulf War was waged.             There has been only one Pope in their lifetime.             They were 10 when the Soviet Union broke apart and do not remember the Cold War.             They are too young to remember the space shuttle Challenger blowing up.             Tianamen Square means nothing to them.             Bottle caps have always been screw off and plastic.             Atari predates them, as do vinyl albums.             The statement ""You sound like a broken record"" means nothing to them.             They have never owned a record player.             They have likely never played Pac Man and have never heard of Pong.             They may have never heard of an 8 track. The Compact Disc was introduced when they were 3 years old.             They have always had an answering machine.             Most have never seen a TV set with only 13 channels, nor have they seen a black and white TV.             They have always had cable.             There have always been VCRs, but they have no idea what BETA was.             They cannot fathom not having a remote control.             They don't know what a cloth baby diaper is, or know about the ""Help me, I've fallen and I can't get up"" commercial.                     Feeling old Yet? There's more:                       They were born 2 years after the Walkman was introduced by Sony.             Roller skating has always meant inline for them.             Michael Jackson has always been white.             Jay Leno has always been on the Tonight Show.             They have no idea when or why Jordache jeans were cool.             Popcorn has always been cooked in the microwave.             They have never seen Larry Bird play.             They never took a swim and thought about Jaws.             The Vietnam War is as ancient history to them as W.W.I, W.W.II and the Civil War.             They have no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran.             They can't imagine what hard contact lenses are.             They don't know who Mork was or where he was from. (The correct answer, by the way, is Ork)             They never heard: ""Where's the beef?"", ""I'd walk a mile for a Camel,"" or ""De plane, de plane!""             They do not care who shot J.R. and have no idea who J.R. was.             Kansas, Chicago, Boston, America, and Alabama are places to them, not bands.

The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment.

[ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]       Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing       The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

clueweb09-en0003-43-28388	"  AFRO-Americ@: Black or White: Madam Walker                  T he daughter of former slaves was born Sarah Breedlove in 1867. Life and responsibilities were thrust on Madame Walker very early, she was orphaned at five, married by the time she was fourteen, a mother by 20 and left a widowed washerwoman soon after.    Her involvement in the hair industry began quite simply because she was trying to stop her own hair from falling out. Her concoction worked so well she shared it with friends. From this very humble beginning was founded a multimillion dollar industry. Not only did she become the first Black woman millionaire, she was probably one of the most famous African-American female business owners of the pre-World War II era.    Walker prided herself as ""the Negro entrepreneur"" whose goal it was to develop and employ African Americans in every aspect of her product manufacturing and distribution. She also expressed concern with non-minority owned hair products that used harsh chemicals that harmed Black hair.   Some of her products included: Wonderful Hair Grower, Vegetable Shampoo Soap and Glossine.

I tried it on my friends; it helped them. I made up my mind I would begin to sell it.  Walker credits God with having given  her  the special hair remedy that would launch  her  business.  God, however, could not do anything about the fact that there was already anot her  entrepreneur selling similar products in St. Louis. Not wanting to face the competition head on, Walker decided to take  her  show on the road.   She had just $1.50 to  her  name, but Walker packed up and moved to Denver, Colorado. She chose Denver because that is where one of  her  brot her/b>s families lived. Walker rented a room in an attic and found work as a cook in order to pay the bills. Once she had saved up some money, she quit  her  job and began working on  her  hair care formula. She continued to wash ot her  people laundry two days a week to earn some money until  her  business  took off.   Walker began selling Wonderful Hair Grower, Glossine, and Vegetable Shampoo door to door. She found them all to be well-received by African American women in Denver. After marrying Charles Joseph (C.J.) Walker, a sales agent for a local African American newspaper, Walker officially changed  her  name to Madam C.J. Walker. She thought the adamwould give  her  products extra appeal.   As Walker profits rose, she reinvested it all back  into  materials and advertising. With help from  her  husband, the two developed a marketing campaign. The marriage quickly ender, however, when Walker proved to be more ambitious than  her  husband and she wanted greater success than he did.   After the two divorced, Walker put  her  daughter in charge of the new mail-order section of their  business.  Walker, meanwhile, continued to travel the country and promote  her  products. In 1908, mot her  and daughter settled in Pittsburgh and established Lelia College, a training facility for the Walker System of Hair Culture.   Walker continued to tour the country and began recruiting a national sales force, called Walker Agents. Everyone from schoolteac hers  to housewives were being taught how to set up  beauty  shops in their own homes, manage their finances, and serve their customers. Soon, Walker had 5,000 agents across the country promoting  her  business  and making  her  $7,000 a week.   In 1913, Walker bought a house in Harlem and decided to make it  her  company new headquarters. Slowly, the company continued to grow and by 1917, annual conventions were being held by Walker agents to train new and old recruits.

J. Walker        Madam C. J. Walker (December 23, 1867 - May 25, 1919) was an inventor, businesswoman and self-made millionaire.  Walker was an African-American who developed many beauty and hair care products that were extremely popular.   Madam Walker was born in Delta,  Louisiana , on the Burney family plantation; her name was originally Sarah Breedlove.  Walker's parents were ex-slaves who had both died by the time Sarah was seven.  Sarah was married at age fourteen to Moses McWilliams.  Widowed at age 20, she moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and supported her daughter, Lelia,  by washing laundry.       In 1905, she moved to Denver, Colorado, and married Charles Joseph (C.J.) Walker, a newspaper sales agent; they were divorced in 1912, but she kept his name. Madam Walker started her cosmetics business in 1906.  Her first product was a scalp treatment that used petrolatum and sulphur to heal scalp disease and to grow hair.  She also softened the hair with an ointment she called Glossine,and straightened the hair with a metal comb.  She did not, however, invent theh ot comb.   She added Madam to her name and began selling her new ""Walker System"" door-to-door.  Walker soon added other cosmetic products to her line.  The products were very successful and she soon had many saleswomen, called ""Walker Agents,""  who sold her products door to door and through beauty salons.  In 1917, her agents came together in one of the nation's first convention of businesswomen. She settled briefly in Pittsburgh in 1908, then established her permanent headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1910.   Madam Walker eventually became a millionaire from her business, which was at its peak from 1911 through 1922; she employed thousands of people. Walker moved to New York in 1916 and became active in influencing the arts and philanthropy. She contributed to many organizations ad educational institutions, including the NAACP, the Tuskegee Institute, Bethune-Cookman College, the YMCA and the YMCA. She also helped spur the Harlem Renaissance through her support of black artists and musicians. The Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company is no longer in business.

Look up  spa ,  Spa ,  SpA  in  Wiktionary , the free dictionary.     This article is about the therapeutic spa.  For other uses, see  Spa (disambiguation) .   The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment. The term thus has various related meanings.

[ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]   Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing   The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

A good rule of thumb is to be honest with yourself and ask ""How long will should I wait before going climbing? Then double that answer and you'll be close.

Elbows         DIAGNOSIS      Lateral Epicondylitis or “tennis elbow”-  Your pain occurs on the “outside” of the elbow and often happens while grasping objects, even something as trivial as a beer bottle. You also may experience pain while turning doorknobs.  For treatment see section below.        Medial Epicondylitis-  This is similar to Lateral epicondylitis, but it is on the “inside” aspect of your elbow.  For treatment see the section below, however the upper forearm strap does not generally help.         Deep elbow pain (brachialis tendonitis) -  I have so far only seen this injury in climbers. The pain is felt deep in the front of your elbow.        Tricep tendonitis -   This occurs in the distal attachment of the tricep tendon (right above the bony part of your elbow and on the “outside”.   Tricep tendonitis rehabilitation:  If you feel a pain in your triceps while working out you should stop immediately and seek medical advice.        TREATMENT   Reduce Inflammation -  Prior to treating any tendentious, you will need to reduce or eliminate the inflammation. Depending on the severity of the injury, take ibuprofen daily and  ice massage with a Styrofoam cup  for 10min (3x/day) Continue antihistamine measures daily even when there is no longer pain. A general rule is 3 days beyond any noticeable pain.     Medial and Lateral Epicondylitis       Stretching -  You can do these stretches right away, but keep out of the painful areas. Stretching discomfort is okay, pain is bad.                                   a) Bend your wrist forward and backward as far as you can with elbow straight and arm in front of you.  When stretching wrist flexion (palm towards body)- keep fingers bent.  When stretching extension (palm away from body)- keep fingers straight.  Hold 30 seconds in each position.  Repeat 5 times.    b) Pronation and supination of the forearm: With your elbow bent 90° (at your side), turn your palm upward and hold for 30 seconds. Slowly turn your palm downward and hold for 30 seconds. Make sure you keep your elbow at your side and bent 90° throughout this exercise.  Repeat 5 times. When these stretches are not painful, you can begin these strengthening exercises:          Strengthening                  a)   Reverse wrist curls:  Hold a soup can or small weight (2-5 lbs) in your hand with your palm facing down. Slowly bend your wrist upward. Slowly lower the weight down into the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10. If this is too easy, use more weight and progress to more weight.    b) Wrist radial deviation:  Put you wrist in the sideways position with your thumb up. Hold a light weight (2-5 lbs) and bend your wrist up, with the thumb reaching toward the ceiling. Slowly lower to the starting position. Do not move your forearm throughout this exercise. Do 3 sets of 10.     c) Forearm pronation and supination:  Hold a light weight (2-5lbs) in your hand and bend your elbow 90°. Slowly rotate your hand with your palm upward and then palm down. Do 3 sets of 10.     Make sure to stop if any of these exercises cause you pain. Use a lighter weight or a soup can. If they hurt to do with a soup can, then it is too soon. Rest another week and try again. When you can do these exercises with at least 5 lbs without pain you can return to climbing.   Many people find that  upper forearm straps  help when they start climbing again. If you decide to use one, do so for the first 4-5 weeks and then attempt to wean yourself off of using it.         Deep elbow pain (brachialis tendonitis)   7-10 days of rest, ice massage (as described above) and strengthening the biceps by bicep curls and reverse bicep curls (with the palm pointing to the floor) after the rest period seem to alleviate the problem.  It has also been suggested that traversing may irritate the brachialis, so consider limiting this.  Tricep Tendonitis       Kneeling push-ups - kneel on the floor with your hands directly underneath your shoulder. Slowly lower yourself to the floor and back up. Once you can do 2 sets of 15 without any pain, switch to normal pushups.        Dumbbell kickbacks - Start with a really light weight and do sets of 20.         French stretch - Stand with your fingers clasped together and your hands high above your head. Stretch by reaching down behind your head and trying to touch your upper back. Keep your elbow pointing towards the front. Hold this position for 20 seconds or so. Repeat 10 times.                                               © 2008 | Site by  Clear Sky Designs       Contact Climbing Injuries                               "

Look up  spa ,  Spa ,  SpA  in  Wiktionary , the free dictionary.     This article is about the therapeutic spa.  For other uses, see  Spa (disambiguation) .   The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment. The term thus has various related meanings.

[ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czechoslovakia revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]       Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing       The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there one a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

Here goes. I've transitioned one horse with (un)soundness issues successfully about two years ago, and like  his feet so much I decided to try it with my newest horse, a 6 year old TB. In Dec I removed his shoes, he had a regular pasture trim until May. He was completely sound during that time after maybe the first two weeks.  I don't ride much in the winter, but he was fine to ride in my ring from March-May. Sometime in May I switched to a barefoot trim. I respect my trimmer, she's done a great job with my other horse, figured it was a win/win. He's out 24/7, herd turnout with varying terrain. Sounds like a recipe for success right? Not so much. I  have been unable to ride this horse since May. He's been too ouchy. It's been one stone bruise after another. I tried the old macs and they haven't helped. He's not just a little sensitive on certain footing, he's ouchy all the time. I just had the vet out for a terrible abcess on Friday. My horse was very uncomfortable, packing and soaking didn't work. The vet pared off some sole to allow the abcess to come out. He said it was huge!!  . I'm ready to throw in the towel. I'm not one of those people that is 100% convinced that every horse can be barefoot, but I like to give them the option, and he's telling me that this doesn't work for him. What in your experience's could explain the difference in soundness/unsoundness? Are there modifications to the trim that can be made for horses that need something extra?  His feet look lovely, well balanced, self trimming...beautiful...so why do they hurt?   I know you're going to want pics, but I can't post them.. Thanks to all who care to reply.     Appassionato Aug. 6, 2006, 12:28 AM Just asking since it's a TB....are his soles that sensitive?  Maybe some Keratex?  For the record, Turpentine didn't do crap for mine.     poopoo Aug. 6, 2006, 12:57 AM He's telling you he just can't do it.  Different horses need different things.  Yeah, maybe in the wild all horses can go barefoot, but some also would go to the coyotes - natural selection at work.  I have one that would definately be coyote food.  He could never go barefoot in a million years.  The feet have been bred right out of the TB's anyway.  I think 3 months is long enough to tell.     ailis36 Aug. 6, 2006, 02:26 AM I had a similar experience with my Thoroughbred gelding. I pulled his shoes the beginning of April. He was sound for about a month and then started to get increasingly sore on harder surfaces. This finally culminated in him being barely able to walk last week. My trimmer told me to get him off pasture that he was suffering from grass laminitis.....the pastures have been particularly rich this year because we have been getting so much rain. Within three days of coming off grass he began to improve. He's not yet a 100% , but much better. He did not founder, and there was no rotation. I'm going to leave him on a dry lot for the rest of the summer. Even though he's a fairly hard keeper, I expect he may have some metabolic issues which make him sensitive to the sugar in grass. Don't know whether this might be the case with your guy, just an idea.     MBPearls Aug. 6, 2006, 03:08 AM My mare's pasturemate has grass laminitis issues - until I met her I had no idea green grass could be bad for a horse.  Because of her issues, the two are stuck in the ""dirt"" pasture suring the summer, and once we have the first freeze they get the rest of the 20 acres to graze on - but until that first freeze, the Paso Fino mare just can't handle the grass.     chism Aug. 6, 2006, 07:48 AM He's not really on grass. There's a very small amount of grass where he is, but it's mostly dirt.  Whatever can grow is immediately eaten by him and his 3 friends. It's basically a mid meal snack, not enough really to make a difference. I'm thinking he's thin soled or has some internal conformational issue. The question for me is ""Why would he be sound with a regular trim and unsound with a barefoot trim?""     CookiePony Aug. 6, 2006, 08:18 AM Did you get a lot of rain in late April/May?  Has the ground been softer since?  Maybe his feet got really soft.  What does your trimmer think is the cause?     chism Aug. 6, 2006, 08:55 AM Yes, we had a ton of rain, but none of my other horses are having issues with bruising and abcessing. I have 5 that are unshod and 2 shod.     luvmytbs Aug. 6, 2006, 09:20 AM The more moisture you had in the spring the softer the feet will be. TB's off the track for the most part have pancake feet, no concavity.   I am assuming your regular farrier trimmed a pasture trim. Once a barefoot trimmer starts trimming, that person will trim for balance and address issues and correct them. In the meantime you can help those soft flat soles by toughening them up with as suggested Keratex. Movement will induce faster growth as well. Some TB's it takes longer then others. You have the choice to stick it out or shoe the horse. You could always have your barefoot trimmer work on him this winter and get some more riding in for the summer in shoes. However, when the ground gets frozen and hard you could see ouchiness if the feet have not started to change before then.  If you already have hoofboots, why not add some padding for the time being.     caballus Aug. 6, 2006, 09:36 AM Chism, I've been thinking on this, too, and how to backup my statements that I've made concerning the situation and make them clearer for understanding.     First, the ""pasture"" trim is not the same as a carefully executed ""barefoot trim"". In the pasture trim the hooves are merely trimmed back with less than diligent attention to the balance, form and functioning of the hooves. Many are left w/long toes, long heels, imbalances, thin soles - all that affect the overall functioning of the hoof. The trim mimics what is done to the hoof prior to shoeing but without the shoes being applied. While the horse may be ""sound"" with a pasture trim the long term effects are not necessarily good ones, especially for a horse that is a performance horse. Pasture trimming does not generally allow for the proper functioning of the hooves which, in turn, affects the overall health of the hooves. The frogs are not developed fully which then cannot absorb concussive shock as well as frogs that are 100% and because the frogs are not developed fully, the hooves are not functining properly which, in turn, do not allow for proper digital cushion development - all part of the shock absorbtion system. That's the main crux in sound hooves ... hooves that are fully functioning with fully developed frogs and digital cushions that allow for full, correct movement of the horse/hooves which, in turn, allow for further correct functioning and growth of the new hooves. Make sense? They all work together. 2 months (May to June and June to July) is not even 1/4 of the time to grow in new, healthy hooves totally for most horses. I think I've mentioned that I've found 4 months healing time seems to be the ""turn around"" point in hooves that are doing some major rehabbing. During the healing time thats passed for your horse its been very wet, the hooves very soft, and in these conditions even strong, healthy, shod hooves have been getting bruised and abscessed. The 2 month time for growing is also not enough time for the frogs and the DC's to fully rehab. The lateral cartilages have not fully been restored to good, thick, healthy supports, either. This all takes time. (see next post)    In a following post I'll throw in some remarks from Dr. Bowker that may help to clarify further what I am trying to say here. I'll also ask you to read some of Marjorie Smith's writings on ""transitioning"" at http://www.barefoothorse.com that will help understanding of what goes on during the first year of healthy, new hoof growth.     Maybe some of it will help so you know I'm not just ""shooting in the dark"" here.     caballus Aug. 6, 2006, 09:43 AM Here are some quotes from Dr. Bowker:     --------------------------  ""We need to be trimming hooves so that more of the back part of the  foot--including the frog--bears the initial ground impact forces and weight,""  Bowker stated.br />   ""If hooves are trimmed so that the frog rests on the ground,"" Bowker said, ""it  stimulates the back part of the hoof to grow more fibrous and cartilaginous  digital cushions, which appear to be 'protective' of the more chronic foot  problems.""    ""Horse feet with good environmental stimulation of the back part of the foot, the  digital cushion, and the lateral cartilages will respond by becoming more robust  structures to dissipate the initial impact energies and provide better support  for the horse when the horse is standing,"" he said.    n those horses that do not have good environmental stimulation of the back part of the foot (for example, a trimmed or recessed frog, rather than one resting on the ground), regardless of the breed, the internal tissues of the back part of the foot will be underdeveloped, which will lead to internal foot problems such as ***(navicular syndrome), according to Bowker.      *** and other hoof pathologies that have to do with form and function of the hooves.    -----------------------------------    The fatty cartilage of an undeveloped DC splats and dissipates with concussive force. The well-developed fibro-cartilage will be able to withstand the forces of the horse's landing and provide adequate shock absorption BUT ... again, it takes time to develop this. This is why boots are recommended for while during the ""transition"" period of time. I know your horse had been barefoot prior to the ""barefoot trim"" but the 'pasture trim', again, does not allow for proper functioning of the hooves during movement and therefore the regeneration of the DC and the frogs did not optimally occur.     An abscess can brew for weeks and weeks ... the tougher the hoof, the longer it will take to find its way ""out"". During this time, because of the pressure within the hoof (think of a blood blister in your toenail - OW!) horse horse is sore until the pressure is relieved as the abscess bursts or is ""dug out"". Then, the horse can move again which will, in turn, promote more circulation in the hoof promoting new horn and tissue development and growth. But, it all takes time.     chism Aug. 6, 2006, 10:15 AM No fair Cab....I've already gotten your input. ;) We can take this offline if you wish....

My suggestion would be to leave his feet alone until he's sound.  Then start trimming his feet in SMALL increments every couple of weeks and see where you get.     onthebit Aug. 6, 2006, 01:12 PM Thanks for your input. I feel that I need to put this out there.

I wasn't commenting on the competence of your farrier or trimmer, more on the competence of some that I have worked with.  :)   I was hoping that my suggestions of the neoprene pads in the boots would be helpful.  I tried two types of pads:  full pads that just fit inside the boot, and pads cut in the shape of the frog.  I taped the frog-shaped pads to her hoof and then put the boots on.  For whatever reason she got the most relief from the frog pads - I did make sure they went all the way back on her frogs and even covered a bit of the heel buttresses.

If you want to shoe him that's fine - but I would wait until you have gotten to sound again. Shoeing a horse that is lame, looking for soundness, is likely to be a big disappointment.  Let him heal up and get happy again first.     chism Aug. 6, 2006, 04:50 PM It's not a matter of being barefoot, it's a matter of trimming HIM correctly.  He was FINE from March to May.

THIS is exactly how I feel. It's not working for HIM, I'm not sure why, but it just isn't. Yes...my trimmer and I have talked, She wants me to give him a couple more trim cycles but I don't think I can  bear to watch him gimp around anymore. I'm really torn, if I put shoes on him then I've wasted the last 8 months trying to give him healthier feet. In trying to give him healthier feet I've given him several months of discomfort, not the end result I was looking for. I think I'll follow your advice and just let him grow out a bit before I make any decisions, maybe he'll be able to tell me what he needs then. I can't do anything for at least two weeks anyway. The vet said whether it's shoes or trim I should wait two weeks to give the hoof time to grow tissue to cover the hole in his sole.     Lookout Aug. 6, 2006, 05:14 PM At what point in the process did the abscessing start?      It's just so hard to offer any meaningful input without seeing some pictures.     chai Aug. 6, 2006, 05:52 PM May, June, July, August...that's a long time to be sore.

Comments?    Abcess can be noted near the toe of the last photo.     goeslikestink Aug. 7, 2006, 08:36 PM um  from the  1st  piccy that foot looks like worn  down to much and at toe  so would be lame  the  second oilly  piccy  is has to  tell but you have a deep groove  on white line  and to sole   that plus abit of purple  dunno if its piccy or not  but groove on white line would tell white line  issue   hard to tell as piccys not  clear enough --     Lookout Aug. 7, 2006, 08:45 PM IMO and I do not mean to do anything other than give constructive criticism but I can't say these feet look like they've been done by a professionial barefoot trimmer for months. In the amount of time he's been trimmed, a whole new heel has had a chance to reach the ground yet it is still very underrun. I don't see any steps taken to correct this. The toe looks very steep, perhaps more so than it is in contrast to the underrun angle of the heel. The lateral shots show lateral cartilages prominently projecting out of the hoof capsule which made me think the heels would be severely contracted, but they're not by any means. LC's sticking out of the hoof capsule are a sure sign there will be pain so you have to investigate other sources for it and correct. One possibility may be the hugely overgrowing onto the sole bars. This foot is not ""deep"" at all; feet which are deeper have room for a long bar, but a foot shaped like this does not. The bar migrates onto the sole quickly and needs to be touched up if it doesn't wear off itself - which it's clearly not doing. Such a bar will pinch the corium and cause the type of pain you have described, as well as crushing the blood vessels and leading to the abscesses you have described. There are certain kinds of feet that you can wait for things to work themselves out, but these are the kind that need proactive correction.     EqTrainer Aug. 7, 2006, 10:31 PM Tee hee, I trim this horse - no really, I don't, but I trim his twin.    Or at least I used to.. his feet don't look like that anymore.    It is created by the horse not wanting to load the back of his foot at any cost.  The toe becomes very steep *appearing* and the quarters expand/flare as shown.    I bet if you got into that foot w/a hoof knife you would see separation all the way around.    I fixed it by not touching his heels for the time being (maybe 3 very short trim cycles?), and just removing all the flare from the toe and floating the quarters as he had quarter cracks too  (it's very deceptive, looks like there is NO toe, then you trim the rest and OMG, look at all that damn toe!).  And yes, his bars were out of control, in fact, one was cracked.  In a few weeks he started to grow in a new tight foot.  It was crazy looking, like he was wearing some sort of bizarre fashionable human shoe.  Then suddenly he had some heel to take off.. and then more heel.. and more heel.. and the whole thing came together and now he is sound and has a tight white line and - well, he's like a whole new horse.     BTW, this horse also was supposedly behind at the knee.  He's not anymore now that he will weight his heels.  I am unsure of what the original pathology of him not weighting his heels was but it seems be be resolved now.  In retrospect it was one of the easiest fixes I have ever seen.     chism Aug. 7, 2006, 11:24 PM Now this...is what I was hoping for!! There's such a wealth of knowledge and experience here on COTH. Thanks to Cab for posting the pics. Thanks to all of you for your thoughts and advice, my horse and I appreciate it. I really do hope to be able to keep him barefoot, but will not rule out the ""S"" word if we can't make him comfortable and sound.     matryoshka Aug. 8, 2006, 12:29 AM I agree with Lookout on this one. There is a lot of heel, even though it is underrun. Except for the trim, this could be my boy's feet. He's got very flat feet, his heels grow straight forward, and his bars grow straight across the sole. His walls flare as soon as they grow beyond the sole.     I take his heels back much further than the heels shown in the pic. I try to leave about 1/8"" of heel depth above the sole, but that means that some of the heel appears a bit run forward. If I take it all the way back so I can see the beginning of the seat of the corn, he will be standing on his live sole. To keep him sound, I end up digging a bit at the seat of the corn, which I don't like to do. So, I've learned where to stop trimming on his feet--his trim differs from other trims that work for other feet.  The outer edge of his sole has to bear weight.  This works for him but probably wouldn't for every horse out there.     I also take the bars down to the level of the sole each and every time. When they start to grow across the sole, he gets heel pain.     I take his toes back ala Pete Ramey, using vertical nipper cuts to get the breakover back without removing wall height.     Even though this trim works well for him under most circumstances, he's still likely to be sore right after a trim when the ground is hard. So I'm learning that not only do I have to trim him differently from other horses but that the trim has to vary depending on the ground conditions. My boy goes great in boots.  He gains concavity when the ground is soft and loses it when the ground gets hard.  Exasperating, really.     I have another flat-footed horse with slightly different hoof conformation. It is possible to bring her heels all the way back and still have a tiny amount of height above the seat of the corn. Her bars are not well defined, and her feet are narrower than they *should* be. I also take her toes back ala Pete Ramey or they will run forward rapidly. She handles rough terrain better than the gelding. She was recently shod for a breed inspection, after which I pulled the shoes. Just having to go from shoes to barefoot has made her sore. We are using hoof hardener to help her with the transition. Even though her feet run forward and her breakover gets way forward with shoes, she is MUCH happier with shoes than without. Soreness from contact with the ground affects her more than run-forward toes. The farrier who shod her is excellent, and I saw the work right after the shoes were applied. The feet simply grow straight forward, even after having been barefoot for almost 3 years now.     If I were trimming your horse, I'd watch him walk (and trot, if possible) and see how his feet land. Is there obvious heel pain?  Is he short striding, stabbing his toes into the ground first?  Or does he just seem a bit uncomfortable?  These are all things we think about before trimming.  And then we reevaluate after the trim to note any improvement.     As trimmers, we can only remove hoof and wait for structures to grow.  It is not a fast process.  I would be distressed if a horse I trimmed was sore for months at a time.  It wouldn't take long before I'd call in somebody with more experience or a different perspective.  In my case, since I'm not against shoes, I'd call a farrier I trust to help evaluate the horse.  I'd also try to meet the vet there to discuss how best to help the horse.     BTW, I'm currently looking into the Natural Balance trimming method.  You can find out more about their theories at www.hopeforsoundness.com (http://www.hopeforsoundness.com).  I havent' tried rockering a toe on a flat footed horse yet, because I don't know how thin the sole is without radiographs.  I can't get over the feeling that they need that callous at the toe.     BumbleBee Aug. 8, 2006, 12:55 AM Agree with the others. There are a lot of ways to make this horse more comfortable.    I think most of the issues have been covered but I didn't see it mentioned that your horse's hooves lack Medial/Lateral balance.    The inside hoofwall (toward the horse's mid-line) of the hoof is quite a bit higher than the outside on both hooves shown.     Much to fix. Is anyone else astounded that vets don't see these issues?     chism Aug. 8, 2006, 06:40 AM For those of you who think the trim needs to change, do you recommend waiting until he's sounder as one OP suggested or making gradual changes asap? If the growth is running forward due to not weighting the heels, would waiting make it worse? WHat I'm most concerned about is  his comfort.       For those that asked about the vet. When the vet came out for the abcess last Friday, I told him that I had changed the trim in May, and was wondering if that was causing the bruising and abcessing, and pondered aloud about whether he needed shoes.  He was very closed mouthed,  made no recommendations about the trim or shoeing. I think he had an opinion but didn't want to share it (and it wasn't positive).     caballus Aug. 8, 2006, 07:17 AM http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v664/caballus/ShowLettera.jpg    This is the hoof with the abscess. (arrow points to it) ... Now that the photos are rotated so we can look straight on, you can see that the hoof is more round in shape as it should be for fronts, there isn't much toe to be backed up at all, just rolled a bit and the heels don't really need to be backed up much (just to the red line). Of course the bars need to be trimmed down. Any other comments?     http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v664/caballus/ShowLetter3a.jpg    The same applies to this shot except this hoof has no abscess.     The side views are confusing as they don't match the solar views. I think that we need to see shots that are not obscured by grass and the lens of the camera needs to be right down on the ground at the same level of the hoof with the lens at right angles to the side of teh hoof. I think we'll see a different picture, then, of the sides.    The ultimate goal with this horse would be to keep him comfie so he can move ... alot! ... on hard, firm ground and get those hooves in proper form and working correctly. As long as he's standing around, not moving, things will not improve well. So I would say that just tweaking these hooves by rolling the walls, taking down the bars and bringing the heels back a bit will suffice for the next trim while the horse is healing from the abscess. Get him moving!     Rick Burten Aug. 8, 2006, 09:03 AM How are you protecting the open wound in his foot?    Gwen's drawings pretty much indicate what I too would do, except that since this horse has a very misaligned HPA, and I think that will be exacerbated when those heels are properly pulled back, I'd shoe him and wedge him up appropriately and with frog support.  The abscessed area can be protectedand treated by pulling some of the steel into a ""bubble"" over that area and then stuffing some medicated cotton under the bubble     The other foot shows the heel on the right side to be taller and more forward than the other heel.  Again, just dropping the heels is not going to be enough.     What is the stuff that's slathered all over the bottom of the one foot?     Tree Aug. 8, 2006, 09:19 AM For those of you who think the trim needs to change, do you recommend waiting until he's sounder as one OP suggested or making gradual changes asap? If the growth is running forward due to not weighting the heels, would waiting make it worse? WHat I'm most concerned about is  his comfort.    Hi Chism,    He's not sound because he's waiting for someone to get those feet trimmed right so I would not wait until he becomes sound where there are things in his feet that are causing unsoundness now.      From what I could tell, he's got heel pain issues judging by how steeply angled the pasterns were.  Then to see the sole views there is entirely too much bar laid over the soles and surrounding the frogs too.  I saw high heels which are underrun.  No wonder this guy hurts.      I see no need in waiting to trim out things that are already in excess like lowering the heels and getting those bars trimmed to where they belong.  The growth is reacting according to the trims.  The trim sets it up and if the trim isn't right then the feet can't be expected to grow right either.  He'd probably be far more comfortable with a trim that would allow him to weight his heels.    edit:  After looking at the sole view showing the abscess I would be definitely wanting the heels lowered to where they belong and bars trimmed to where they belong as that abscess is likely beneath the coffin bone to that side of its tip.  I'd expect to see a tilted coffin bone in a lateral xray of that foot.   The foot is frontally loaded and putting too much pressure towards the toe.  While the heels don't appear to need that much to bring them back to the widest part of the frog I'd be guessing doing so would drop them atleast by a quarter inch and when you think of that in terms of hoof balance, a little goes a long way in physics.

Rick Burten Aug. 8, 2006, 10:24 AM Even if it causes the horse to be sore?  Have you considered that if a 'correct' trim makes the horse sore, that perhaps the trim is incorrect, or even if it is correct, by itself, it is not enough/adequate?     Lookout Aug. 8, 2006, 10:53 AM Even if it causes the horse to be sore?     He's already sore, isn't he?     Lookout Aug. 8, 2006, 10:54 AM lack Medial/Lateral balance.     The inside hoofwall (toward the horse's mid-line) of the hoof is quite a bit higher than the outside on both hooves shown.     Which shots is this visible in?     irishcas Aug. 8, 2006, 12:47 PM I'm in Gwen's camp on this one, I would lower the heels a bit, along with the bars and really roll the foot from Quarter to Quarter.  I would not wedge up the foot or put shoes on to protect the wound.  I would put some wool felt in the bottom of Old Mac's sprinkle some Gold Bond Medicated Foot Powder in there and the hole will close up within a few days.  That looks like prolapsed corium to me.   I missed the beginnings of the thread but if it's an abscess I might palpatate the sole in that area to see if pus comes out, while squeezing some iodine in there to suck it in.  Works wonders :)    The Gold Bond helps to dry it all up to facilitate the whole closing.

There will be debate over bit by bit or all at once, but they need to come down quite a lot.  They are way too high and underrun.  You have an almost ground parallel hairline, which is not what you want.      I would go here:  http://www.gossiping.net/phpBB2/?mforum=equinextionforu    You will see lots of case studies.    Good luck!!!!     matryoshka Aug. 8, 2006, 01:49 PM Here's the thing.  If you are using a trimmer who can only trim, and he/she takes the heels and bars down as most of us think needs to be done, AND the horse is still sore, what then?     Personally, even though I'm a trimmer, I'd rather have a farrier who knows how to balance a hoof properly trim the heels back. Then, if the horse is still sore, that same person can apply shoes, with or without a wedge as necessary. At this point, the horse needs some freedom from pain--it has been a while.  Does that put me in Rick's camp? :eek:  Heaven help us!     One can wrap abscesses until they heal, also.  I've used epsom salts moistenened in a diaper and wrapped with vetrap and duct tape.  This doesn't work great for turnout, but it can be done.  A long time ago, a vet recommended I NOT use hoof boots to protect open hoof sores, since sand a grit can work its way in and possibly cause another abscess.  This was a foundered mare who had lost a portion of her hoof, but I continue to follow this advice.  If you want to boot the horse, place a wrap underneath so grit can't work its way to the hoof itself.     Rick Burten Aug. 8, 2006, 02:11 PM Does that put me in Rick's camp? :eek:  Heaven help us!     It puts you in the camp of ""Truth, Justice, Common Sense and the American Way"" :)     Congratulations on not giving in to the dark side :D     chism Aug. 8, 2006, 05:04 PM How are you protecting the open wound in his foot?    Gwen's drawings pretty much indicate what I too would do, except that since this horse has a very misaligned HPA, and I think that will be exacerbated when those heels are properly pulled back, I'd shoe him and wedge him up appropriately and with frog support.  The abscessed area can be protectedand treated by pulling some of the steel into a ""bubble"" over that area and then stuffing some medicated cotton under the bubble     The other foot shows the heel on the right side to be taller and more forward than the other heel.  Again, just dropping the heels is not going to be enough.     What is the stuff that's slathered all over the bottom of the one foot?    The hole from the abcess is soaked 2x daily in hot water and epsom salts, then wrapped. The foot looks oily because his hoof was wet from the soak (otherwise it would have been wrapped...not helpful for pics).  What do you mean by a misaligned HPA? I'm not familiar with the term.  I appreciate the shoeing advice, but I'm not ready to go there yet.     caballus Aug. 8, 2006, 05:06 PM The inside hoofwall (toward the horse's mid-line) of the hoof is quite a bit higher than the outside on both hooves shown.

That's by definition the light side. :lol:      I, too think the heels are unlevel.  But one can only tell so much from a picture.  I'd love to see before and after pics of a trim, plus overall conformation shots.  I can't even count the times I've looked at a horse's foot and thought ""what the fruitbat"" only to look up and see where it was coming from.  Trimmed a horse like that today.  No way his feet are ever going to look balanced in a pic, between old injuries and conformation issues.  It's a rescue, so we'll never know the history that created the problems.  Sweet horse, though.     BumbleBee Aug. 8, 2006, 05:53 PM This is what I am seeing. Of course I could be the victim of a misleading photo but it seams pretty clearly out of balance.    http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k185/BumbleBeeEMG/ShowLetter3myview.gif     caballus Aug. 8, 2006, 06:31 PM I was asking about the hoofwalls being so different in height - not the out of balance. How can you tell from that photo that the walls are ""quite"" unequal in height? Yes, I see the hoof is slightly out of balance but if you look at the size and shape of the heel bulbs they are not all that out of whack and if you look at the markings I've drawn on the photo posted below you can see that the hoof is not symetrically all that out of balance. If the walls were ""quite"" different one from another then the hoof would be more assymetrical in form. This is a hoof that has not gotten alot of abrasion/movement in the last few weeks from the looks of it.     I'm not understanding the lines you drew on the photo? Would you explain? Thx.     http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v664/caballus/ShowLetter3b.jpg     EqTrainer Aug. 8, 2006, 06:33 PM Personally I would not lower this horses heels right now.   As I stated before, I agree that he is not bearing weight on them NOW, due to pain.  Lower them and he probably will get even more painful and less inclined to move around.  The less he moves, the less hoof mechanism he has, the less healing he experiences.  I think he is more unsound on hard ground because of all the separation and flare.  I bet if you just removed the flare he'd get comfy enough to let you lower the heels next trim cycle.  Two weeks would probably be enough if his owner was willing to walk him or longe him on a relatively hard surface.      The horse I work on like this is now w/t/c freely and happily for the first time in years.  It has taken about four months.     Rick Burten Aug. 8, 2006, 06:53 PM The hole from the abcess is soaked 2x daily in hot water and epsom salts, then wrapped.

I appreciate the shoeing advice, but I'm not ready to go there yet.  Thanks, that explains the 'oily' look.    HPA: Hoof-Pastern Alignment.  In your horse's case, the HPA is broken forward(rather than in a straight longitudinal alignment) and as a result, p2 is jamming into the coronary band. Preferably, the short pastern bone is centered in the hoof capsule.    Also, because the heels are run forward, they are not providing proper heel support.  In fact, in their current location, they are creating an abnormal force vector to the quarters which if left un-addressed, can lead to jamming and even , quarter cracks.  Since the horse's base of support is inadequate/improper, heel pain becomes a real issue.    Whether or not you choose to shoe your horse is of course up to you.  The horse has no say in the matter.  That's too bad because most of the time they really have something to say.  What that is of course, is something you may not want to hear.     Rick Burten Aug. 8, 2006, 06:58 PM How can you see/tell this on a 2 dimensional photo from a solar shot and no frontal shots?  Not sure if this was directed at me or not.  However, it is really obvious that the heel on the right side in the photo is further forward, there is more bar material, the collateral groove on that side is deeper.  All of which indicates that the heel is taller which won't happen unless the wall is longer(unless of course the quarters have been relieved, which isn't evident in this photo).      The mark-up done by BumbleBee show precisely this.  As someone who is fond of marking-up photos Gwen, I am suprised you don't see this and understand what the lines are showing.     Tree Aug. 8, 2006, 07:00 PM Even if it causes the horse to be sore?      Caballus,     That is a good question to ask.    Lowering the heels wouldn't sore this horse UNLESS the bars were not trimmed like they should be and anything else about the hoof for that matter.      There are reasons why horses would become heel sore and those pics clearly showed, IMO, room for more heel to be lowered because they were shy of the widest part of the frog as they were.  However, if the rest of the hoof isn't trimmed well, yeah, soreness could be the result.  There was plenty of bar and frog to be trimmed though without soring a horse.  The horse is sore now as it is.  There is a reason for it...improper hoof form leading to dysfunction.  The abscess has drained but that abscess is beneath the coffin bone.  That's a bad sign of how that coffin bone is oriented within the hoof capsule.    Tree     Rick Burten Aug. 8, 2006, 07:04 PM Personally I would not lower this horses heels right now.

And how is removing this flare going to address the issues of his underrun heels, misaligned HPA, p2 jamming the coronary band, and the apparently too heavy loading of the sole anterior to the apex of the frog?     The flare, if there really is a flare, and if it is in the quarters, will not resolve so long as those heels are run forward the way they currently are.  Especially on the one side of the one foot.      Since your options are so limitied, I suppose the advise given is the best you have at your disposal.     Tree Aug. 8, 2006, 07:10 PM Personally I would not lower this horses heels right now.   As I stated before, I agree that he is not bearing weight on them NOW, due to pain.  Lower them and he probably will get even more painful and less inclined to move around.    The horse is sore now but it has much to do with its present hoof form.  You couldn't just simply lower the heels and expect the soreness to disappear.  There is much more that requires trimming than just those heels.  Bars are often the cause for heel pain.  These heels aren't too short nor would they be if lowered to where they'd end at the widest part of the frog either.  The bars are all over the soles and those are much harder (horn) than sole horn.  This is what can set the soles up for bruising where bar horn has remained for too long.  The bars are also bent which is another indicator of excess bar material being left unattended to.      I would submit that the pain the horse has in its heels IS from what hasn't been trimmed enough.  So I would expect the horse to feel immediate relief once those areas were trimmed.  Improper hoof causing pain shouldn't be left for long.  With heel pain the horse would continue to load its toes and relieve the heels which just makes things worse vs better.    Tree     caballus Aug. 8, 2006, 07:29 PM Not sure if this was directed at me or not.

The mark-up done by BumbleBee show precisely this.  As someone who is fond of marking-up photos Gwen, I am suprised you don't see this and understand what the lines are showing.    Well, actually, again, what the heel bulbs are saying is different from what is being stated. That medial heel is a ""bit"" higher but not ""quite"" higher. The bar is a mess, understood completely. I'm not seeing a collateral groove that is deeper ... again, two dimensional doesn't really allow for a true view. What would allow for a more clear view would be clean, clear shots from the rear of the hoof showing the depth of the collateral grooves and the height of each heel.    The markup by BumbleBee is not explanation just notations and I thought maybe she could clarify for the readers exactly what the markings are.     caballus Aug. 8, 2006, 07:32 PM What flare are you referring to? And how is removing this flare going to address the issues of his underrun heels, misaligned HPA, p2 jamming the coronary band, and the apparently too heavy loading of the sole anterior to the apex of the frog?    The flare, if there really is a flare, and if it is in the quarters, will not resolve so long as those heels are run forward the way they currently are. Especially on the one side of the one foot.     Looking at the photo http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v664/caballus/ShowLetter3a.jpg you can see the wall needs trimming ""in"" (as opposed to down in height but that's another issue) in the medial qtr. and the lateral, just a wee bit. That excess that is outside the ""form"" of the hoof as indicated by the red line indicates that there is flaring. Since we have no top shots then no one can say for sure but its a pretty good bet that the hooves have flares.     irishcas Aug. 8, 2006, 07:40 PM Caballus,     That is a good question to ask.    Lowering the heels wouldn't sore this horse UNLESS the bars were not trimmed like they should be and anything else about the hoof for that matter.      Tree    While I agree the bars need to be lowered, lowering the heels to put this horse on his frog and weightbearing on the back of his foot, could sore him more.  It is fairly obvious that this horse is flared in the quarters which in my experience leads to weak tissues inside the foot.  Since we are looking at a few pix and only a few we can't possible make blanket statements that following a formula will create a sound horse.  I've found it takes time and frequent mild trims to get soundness.  Also what is this horse eating, what is his weight, how wet are the pastures.    I know the OP is asking for help but we have limited information to go on here.  Pushing this horse back on it's heels/frog could cause even more toe walking.  Remove the flares around the foot and it will start to fix itself.     irishcas Aug. 8, 2006, 07:49 PM The horse is sore now but it has much to do with its present hoof form.    How can you possibly say this with such conviction you have no idea if this is true.       You couldn't just simply lower the heels and expect the soreness to disappear.  There is much more that requires trimming than just those heels.  Bars are often the cause for heel pain.     Based on Strassers methods, which are questionable.  Why are you so obsessed with the darn bars?      The bars are all over the soles and those are much harder (horn) than sole horn.    How can you possibly know this?  Dr. Bowkers research (in a lab) with a microscope and his skills as a scientist have shown that bar material helps grow sole, how could it be harder than the material it grows?  How have you documented this?  What instruments have you used to prove this and since I'm fairly certain no scientific studies have been done, how have you formed this opinion?      This is what can set the soles up for bruising where bar horn has remained for too long.  The bars are also bent which is another indicator of excess bar material being left unattended to.    Wrong again.  The bars are bent because the flare in the Quarters are pulling them out.  Fix the flaring around the foot and it will fix the laid over bar material.  These bars need a light cleaning up down to almost sole level.     Most times if you trim too much bar you cause the horse to toe walk.  Which unweights the back of the foot and doesn't strengthen the underlying structures.    Of course this is all my opinion based on my findings and the research I've read by Bowker and Pollitt.     irishcas Aug. 8, 2006, 07:55 PM What flare are you referring to?  And how is removing this flare going to address the issues of his underrun heels, misaligned HPA, p2 jamming the coronary band, and the apparently too heavy loading of the sole anterior to the apex of the frog?     The flare, if there really is a flare, and if it is in the quarters, will not resolve so long as those heels are run forward the way they currently are.  Especially on the one side of the one foot.        Hi Rick:    First off the foot does have flaring especially in the quarters and if the heels are underrun then you can guarantee there is flaring in the front of the foot as well.  Sometimes the whole capsule is flared other times it's more 1/2 way down to the toe.  I know you like big words and anatomically correct wording but I'm sticking to the laymens terms :)    Bring the toe back over time and the underrun heels will go away.  Shoes will not make it go away.  Same with the Quarters, where I see an injury at the bulb/coronet band in the back of the foot.    Fixing the flaring/breakover will fix the heels, which will help with the HPA, which will fix the bars, etc, etc.    There is no quick fix and it will take at least 2 years for this foot to look more balanced.  It shouldn't take this long for the horse to be sound on most terrains and sound with boots on gravel/hard ground.    What still hasn't been addressed is diet, environment, weight.      The OP did ask for opinions and as usual she is getting them but we need better pictures and more detailed info.  Also would like to see photos of this horse the day the shoes were pulled.  With shoes on and after.    Regards,     Tree Aug. 8, 2006, 08:00 PM Tree    While I agree the bars need to be lowered, lowering the heels to put this horse on his frog and weightbearing on the back of his foot, could sore him more.     How will you know if you don't try?  The hooves indicate the heels have room to come down.  The horse is sore already with how the feet are in the pics.  If you're not able to lower the heels and trim the bars as to remove the issues causing the soreness then someone else would have to do it.

This topic seems to be debated heavily each year as warm weather approaches.            Many people will argue that clipping or shaving off the long coat is            sensible: ""We don't wear our winter coats in the hot weather do            we? - so why should our dog?"" Those who don't want to clip that            lovely long hair often reply that ""the hair has a function and            beside I like the way it looks.""            We don't want to argue, but we thought we would research this and provide            some interesting facts.           First let's look at how hair functions, particularly the so called            ""double coat"" often found with northern breeds or those that            developed in cold climates. When you look at your dog you are generally            looking at the outer layer of hair called ""guard hairs"", which            overlay the fur and serve to protect it. This is stiffer and often longer            hair. Beneath the guard hairs is usually a layer called the ""underfur""            which is often seen as a wooly like (soft downy) hair when you groom            out the dog.            We all generally accept that this combination of hair (called ""pelage"")            provides insulation from the cold in the winter. This combination is            not very effective as insulation until it is fairly well developed,            thus cutting it short or shaving would reduce the effectiveness as insulation.            But do we accept that this also insulates against heat? Generally that            is a bit more difficult to go along with.            In fact, the double coat does provide insulation in the summer. The            principle of insulation is that heat flows from a warmer to cooler.            This is similar to how insulation works in your home. For example insulation            helps stop the heat in your home from flowing out in the winter, and            also helps heat from the outside from flowing into your home in the            summer by providing effective resistance to that flow. It is the same            principle for the dog's coat providing insulation to prevent heat from            flowing to your dog's skin in the summer!           Still hard to swallow this concept? To help, let's consider the example            of the home and make comparisons once more. Most would feel that eventually            that heat is going to get into the home. But modern day technology has            thankfully provided us with air conditioning? Guess what, dogs have            a heat removal system too! Dogs don't sweat like humans so there is            no evaporation from the body skin to help cool them down. Dogs mainly            cool themselves by panting and loose some heat through the dilation            of the blood vessels in the skin of the face, ears and feet. Panting            uses evaporation to cool as the dog breaths in through the nose and            out through the mouth directing air over the mucous membranes of the            tongue, throat and trachea.           The basic concept is to have insulation to reduce the amount of heat            flowing in, and thus reduce the amount of heat that needs to be dissipated            through panting. But there are other considerations to be concerned            with. Dog hair as insulation uses the principle that air is not a good            conductor of heat. Like other insulation materials called ""Bulk            Insulation"", dog hair needs to trap air to work. Bulk insulation            traps pockets of still air within it's structure to provide the resistance            to heat flow. But also like other insulation materials - if you compress            them they loose their efficiency - thus mats should be avoided by using            good grooming practices.           Of course you may have other reasons to clip your dog's hair. Maybe            it is just easier to maintain or maybe you just don't have time to remove            all those mats. Maybe it just makes you feel better or you like the            look. Maybe there is a skin problem. If you do clip, you can of course            leave a couple inches of hair to maintain some of the insulation.           A dog's coat also helps protect against ultraviolet light. Dogs do            get sunburn, so don't clip it too short. Generally sunburn is seen where            the hair is the thinnest (bridge of nose, tips of ears, underbelly).            If you clip too short you may expose the body in a similar fashion.            If necessary use some sort of sun screen (but make sure it is safe for            your dog! Some, like Paba have been indicated as not safe for dogs).            Also remember that in climates like Arizona (and possible elsewhere)            sunburn can turn into skin cancer.           Of course many people clip the hair each year. Their dogs play in the            water or run though fields and pick up twigs and burs and the mats would            otherwise be unmanageable (and the insulation factor lost). Just be            careful to leave an inch or two of fur to provide some insulation and            protection from sunburn.

A good rule of thumb is to be honest with yourself and ask ""How long will should I wait before going climbing? Then double that answer and you'll be close.

Elbows         DIAGNOSIS      Lateral Epicondylitis or “tennis elbow”-  Your pain occurs on the “outside” of the elbow and often happens while grasping objects, even something as trivial as a beer bottle. You also may experience pain while turning doorknobs.  For treatment see section below.        Medial Epicondylitis-  This is similar to Lateral epicondylitis, but it is on the “inside” aspect of your elbow.  For treatment see the section below, however the upper forearm strap does not generally help.         Deep elbow pain (brachialis tendonitis) -  I have so far only seen this injury in climbers. The pain is felt deep in the front of your elbow.        Tricep tendonitis -   This occurs in the distal attachment of the tricep tendon (right above the bony part of your elbow and on the “outside”.   Tricep tendonitis rehabilitation:  If you feel a pain in your triceps while working out you should stop immediately and seek medical advice.        TREATMENT   Reduce Inflammation -  Prior to treating any tendentious, you will need to reduce or eliminate the inflammation. Depending on the severity of the injury, take ibuprofen daily and  ice massage with a Styrofoam cup  for 10min (3x/day) Continue antihistamine measures daily even when there is no longer pain. A general rule is 3 days beyond any noticeable pain.     Medial and Lateral Epicondylitis       Stretching -  You can do these stretches right away, but keep out of the painful areas. Stretching discomfort is okay, pain is bad.                                   a) Bend your wrist forward and backward as far as you can with elbow straight and arm in front of you.  When stretching wrist flexion (palm towards body)- keep fingers bent.  When stretching extension (palm away from body)- keep fingers straight.  Hold 30 seconds in each position.  Repeat 5 times.    b) Pronation and supination of the forearm: With your elbow bent 90° (at your side), turn your palm upward and hold for 30 seconds. Slowly turn your palm downward and hold for 30 seconds. Make sure you keep your elbow at your side and bent 90° throughout this exercise.  Repeat 5 times. When these stretches are not painful, you can begin these strengthening exercises:          Strengthening                  a)   Reverse wrist curls:  Hold a soup can or small weight (2-5 lbs) in your hand with your palm facing down. Slowly bend your wrist upward. Slowly lower the weight down into the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10. If this is too easy, use more weight and progress to more weight.    b) Wrist radial deviation:  Put you wrist in the sideways position with your thumb up. Hold a light weight (2-5 lbs) and bend your wrist up, with the thumb reaching toward the ceiling. Slowly lower to the starting position. Do not move your forearm throughout this exercise. Do 3 sets of 10.     c) Forearm pronation and supination:  Hold a light weight (2-5lbs) in your hand and bend your elbow 90°. Slowly rotate your hand with your palm upward and then palm down. Do 3 sets of 10.     Make sure to stop if any of these exercises cause you pain. Use a lighter weight or a soup can. If they hurt to do with a soup can, then it is too soon. Rest another week and try again. When you can do these exercises with at least 5 lbs without pain you can return to climbing.   Many people find that  upper forearm straps  help when they start climbing again. If you decide to use one, do so for the first 4-5 weeks and then attempt to wean yourself off of using it.         Deep elbow pain (brachialis tendonitis)   7-10 days of rest, ice massage (as described above) and strengthening the biceps by bicep curls and reverse bicep curls (with the palm pointing to the floor) after the rest period seem to alleviate the problem.  It has also been suggested that traversing may irritate the brachialis, so consider limiting this.  Tricep Tendonitis       Kneeling push-ups - kneel on the floor with your hands directly underneath your shoulder. Slowly lower yourself to the floor and back up. Once you can do 2 sets of 15 without any pain, switch to normal pushups.        Dumbbell kickbacks - Start with a really light weight and do sets of 20.         French stretch - Stand with your fingers clasped together and your hands high above your head. Stretch by reaching down behind your head and trying to touch your upper back. Keep your elbow pointing towards the front. Hold this position for 20 seconds or so. Repeat 10 times.                                               © 2008 | Site by  Clear Sky Designs       Contact Climbing Injuries                               "

Diversity guarantees that your organization benefits from the important contributions made by people from all different backgrounds when they are empowered to work together comfortably and creatively.   Why is it important to develop an environment where there is diversity?   If employees in a changing work- and marketplace are not equipped and  encouraged to work side-by- side with mutual respect, and honoring one another,  organizations risk losing qualified staff as well as valuable clients and customers.   What to expect when your organization believes in the power of successful diversity management?   YOU     establish a corporate culture where everyone feels valued.   proactively cultivate the increased productivity and creativity diversity unleashes.       YOUR EMPLOYEES     recognize diversity as a genuine asset to the workplace and value one anothers contributions more.   proactively work with one another to resolve conflicts and increase the quality of work.       YOUR CUSTOMERS /CLIENTS     from different groups feel welcome and understood, resulting in increased business and improved loyalty.

Look up  spa ,  Spa ,  SpA  in  Wiktionary , the free dictionary.     This article is about the therapeutic spa.  For other uses, see  Spa (disambiguation) .   The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment. The term thus has various related meanings.

[ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czechoslovakia revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]       Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing       The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there one a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

clueweb09-en0002-44-14646	            Home |     Sitemap       Natural Herbal Beauty      Natural Herbal Remedies for Family Health, Natural Treatments, Home Remedies and Various Health Guides                         Wed 19 Nov 2008   Health Tips for Sore Throat  Posted by arlene under  Cleaner  ,   Diet  ,   Health  ,   Health Formula  ,   Leaves  ,   Massage  ,   Natural  ,   Relax  ,   Tea        Symptoms   The classic  symptoms  of a sore  throat  include a burning sensation or “scratchiness” in the back of the  throat ;  pain , especially when swallowing; and, perhaps, tenderness along the neck. These  symptoms  may be  accompanied  by:     Sneezing and coughing.   Hoarseness.   Runny nose.   Mild fever.   General fatigue.     Call Your Doctor If     you also have a fever higher than 101F without other cold  symptoms ; this may indicate a case of strep  throat , which needs treatment.   you also have flulike  symptoms  that don’t get better after a few days; this may indicate infectious mononucleosis.   any hoarseness lasts longer than two weeks; this could be a sign of  throat  cancer or oral cancer.   your sore  throat is accompanied  by drooling, or you experience difficulty swallowing or breathing; this may indicate an inflamed epiglottis, the structure that overhangs the opening to the larynx, or an abscess in the back of the  throat ; these two uncommon conditions require medical attention.         Treatment Options   Most alternative therapies for sore  throat  are geared toward symptom  relief , although some address the cause. A sore  throat  usually goes away on its own. However, if the  pain  persists or worsens after a few days, you should see your doctor.     Aromatherapy   To increase blood circulation and improve fluid drainage in sore areas,  massage  your  throat  and chest with a lotion made with 2 drops each of eucalyptus globulus  (E. globulus)  and cypress in 2  tsp  of a carrier oil such as vegetable or almond oil.       Herbal  Therapies   At the first  sign of soreness , take  three  raw cloves of  garlic   (Allium sativum)  a day. ( Garlic  is a  natural antibiotic  and antiseptic.) If  garlic  smell becomes a problem, try four  garlic  oil capsules instead.  Teas  made from either goldenseal  (Hydrastis canadensis)  or echinacea  (Echinacea  spp.) may also be effective. One of the best  herbal  treatments uses ginger  (Zingiber officinale),  which is noted for its anti-inflammatory properties. Simmer 2  tsp  chopped fresh ginger in  water  for 20  minutes ; breathe in the steam from this  tea  for five  minutes  and repeat two or  three times  a day.   A traditional Native American treatment is drinking  a tea  made from the inner bark of the slippery elm  (Ulmus fulva).  Put 2  tsp  powdered bark in 1  cup   water . Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15  minutes .   Homeopathy   Homeopaths prescribe several remedies for sore  throats . Consult a homeopathic practitioner or try those listed here:   If the  pain   comes on suddenly  and is  accompanied  by great thirst and hoarseness, try  Aconite  (6c)  three times  a day.   If the  pain   comes on suddenly  and is  accompanied  by fever, headache, and restlessness, use  Belladonna  (6c)  three times  a day.   If your sore  throat  has come on gradually and is  accompanied  by fatigue, try  Ferrum phos phoricum  (6c)  three times  a day.   If the back of your  throat  is red and swollen and the  pain  is relieved by cold  water  or ice, try  Apis  (6c)  three times  a day.   If your sore  throat is accompanied  by flulike  symptoms , extreme sluggishness, and weakness, use  Gelsemium  (6c)  three times  a day.   Nutrition and  Diet   At the first  sign of soreness , take 500 to 6,000 mg of vitamin C daily to help fight the cold or other viral infection causing it. CAUTION: Unless your body is accustomed to megadoses of vitamin C, it cannot absorb more than about 1,000 mg every two hours; the excess will be passed off in your urine or, in some cases, result in diarrhea.   Home Remedies     Get plenty of rest and drink a lot of fluids.   Suck on a zinc lozenge (consult a nutritionist for dosages). Zinc can relieve sore  throats  and other cold  symptoms  but may cause nausea if taken on an empty stomach.    To help relieve the  pain , apply a warm heating pad or compress to your  throat . You can also try a warm chamomile poultice:  Mix  1 tbsp dried chamomile  (Matricaria recutita)  into 1 or 2  cups  boiling  water ; steep for five  minutes , then strain. Soak a clean cloth or towel in the  tea , wring it out, then apply to your  throat . Remove the cloth when it becomes cold. Repeat as often as necessary.     Try steam inhalations to ease the  pain . Run very hot  water  in a sink. With a towel draped over your head to trap the steam, lean over the sink while the  water  is running. Breathe deeply through your mouth and nose for five to 10  minutes . Repeat several  times  a day.   Homemade Gargles   To wash away mucus and irritants and bring  relief  from the  pain  of a sore  throat , try any of the following gargles:     Salt  water :  Mix  1/2  asp  salt in 8  oz warm water .   Sage: Put 1 to 2  asp  dried  leaves  in 1  cup boiling water ; steep for 10  minutes , then strain and cool until lukewarm.   Lemon:  Mix the juice  of one lemon in 8  oz warm water   Horseradish:  Mix  I tbsp pure horseradish, 1  asp  hon  ey, and 1  asp  ground cloves in 8  oz warm water .       Raspberry: Put .1 to 2  tsp  raspberry  leaf  in 1  cup boiling water ; steep for 10  minutes , then strain and cool until lukewarm.   Cayenne pepper :  Mix the juice  of half a lemon, 1 tbsp salt, and 1/4  tsp   cayenne pepper  (or more if you can tolerate it) in V2  cup  warm  water . The  cayenne pepper  temporarily reduces the amount of  pain -causing chemicals produced by nerve endings in the  throat .

Look up  spa ,  Spa ,  SpA  in  Wiktionary , the free dictionary.     This article is about the therapeutic spa.  For other uses, see  Spa (disambiguation) .   The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment. The term thus has various related meanings.

[ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]   Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing   The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome often occur in both hands, but symptoms are usually worse in one hand than the other. You may first notice symptoms at night; people with carpal tunnel syndrome can usually fall asleep, but pain or numbness may wake them up.  Mild carpal tunnel symptoms primarily affect the hand and sometimes the forearm, but they can radiate up to the shoulder. Symptoms  include: Numbness or pain in your hand, forearm, or wrist that awakens you at night. (Shaking or moving your fingers may ease this numbness and pain.)   Occasional tingling, numbness, ""pins-and-needles"" sensation, or pain. The feeling is similar to your hand ""falling asleep.""   Numbness or pain that worsens while using your hand or wrist, especially when gripping an object with your hand or bending (flexing) your wrist.   Occasional aching pain in your forearm between your elbow and wrist.   Stiffness in your fingers when you get up in the morning.   Symptoms most often occur in the parts of the hand supplied by the median nerve: the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger. If your little finger is not affected, this may be a sign that the condition is carpal tunnel syndrome, because the little finger is usually controlled by a different nerve than the thumb and other fingers.

The arms are extended to sides with fingers touching       a piece of masking tape. A second piece of tape is placed beyond       the first piece:                   12 cm apart for subjects less than 45 years of age          8 cm apart for subjects 45 years or older                Set metronome at 40 beats per minute. At the first beep, the       subject slowly lifts the shoulder blades off the mat by flexing       spine until finger tips reach the second piece of tape. At the       next beep, the subject slowly returns shoulder blades to mat       by flattening lower back. Subject repeats curl-up in time with       the metronome (20 curl-ups per minute).         One repetition is counted each time shoulder blades touches       the floor. Subject performs as many curl-ups as possible without       stopping, up to a maximum of 75 repetitions.  The test is       terminated if the cadence is broken.          Allow the subject to practice a few repetitions before test       begins. Instruct the subject to breathe easily during the exercise       so as not to invoke the Valsalva maneuver. Make sure that the       fingertips are not beyond the first line in the starting position.         Since elevation of the       truck to 30° is the important criteria, alternative techniques       can be considered:                   placing hands on thighs and curling up until hands reach         knee caps.          hands positioned across chest with head activating a counter         when spin is flexed 30°.

Most of these injuries can be handled at home with simple first-aid treatment.      First-aid for superficial cuts and wounds:              Calm your child and let him/her know you can help.         Apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage for several minutes to stop bleeding.         Wash your hands thoroughly.         Protect the eyes from any soap or antiseptics you may need to use on the wound.         Wash the cut area well with soap and water, but do not scrub the wound. Remove any dirt particles from the area and let the water from the faucet run over it for several minutes. A dirty cut or scrape that is not thoroughly cleaned can cause scarring.         Apply an antiseptic lotion or cream.         Cover the area with an adhesive bandage or gauze pad. Change the dressing often.         Check the area each day and keep it clean and dry.         Avoid blowing on the abrasion, as this can cause germs to grow.         Bruises, blisters, or swollen areas caused by trauma may be treated by placing an ice or cold pack on the area every one to two hours for 10 to 15 minutes for the first 24 hours.         Use a sunscreen (sun protection factor, or SPF, at least 15 or greater) on healed cuts and wounds to help prevent scarring.           When should I call my child's physician?      Specific treatment for cuts and wounds of the face that require more than minor treatment at home will be determined by your child's physician. In general, call your child's physician for cuts and wounds of the face that are:              bleeding heavily and do not stop after 5 to 10 minutes of direct pressure. If the bleeding is profuse, hold pressure for 5 to 10 minutes without stopping to look at the cut. If the cloth becomes soaked with blood, put a new cloth on top of the old one. Do not lift the original cloth.         on the eyelids or involve the eyes. Injury to the eye area requires evaluation by a physician.         deep or longer than 1/2 inch.         caused by a puncture wound, or dirty or rusty object.         embedded with debris such as dirt, stones, or gravel.         ragged or have separated edges.         caused by an animal or human bite.         excessively painful or if you suspect a fracture or head or bone injury.         showing signs of infection such as increased warmth, redness, swelling, or drainage.           Also call your child's physician if:              your child has not had a tetanus vaccination within the past five years, or if you are unsure when your child's last tetanus shot was given.         you are concerned about the wound or have any questions           Preventing facial injuries:      The following are a few guidelines for preventing facial injuries in children:              Teach your child not to poke or place objects in the ears or nose, such as cotton swabs or pencils.         Teach your child not to walk or run while holding an object in his/her mouth.         Teach your child not to suck or chew on hard, sharp, or pointed objects.         Have your child wear protective eye, ear, or face guards for sports activities that could cause injury.

ESAC concluded that the Modified EpiDerm SIT has sufficient accuracy and reliability for the prediction of skin irritating and non-irritating test substances.   The Updated EpiDerm SIT is a modification of the previously validated EpiDerm skin irritation method (ESAC Statement, April 2007). The major modification is an extended chemical exposure time from 15 to 60 minutes that reflects the robust barrier function of the EpiDerm model. The new exposure time provides an improved sensitivity of the in vitro EpiDerm SIT and better correlation with in vivo Draize rabbit skin irritation results. Read about:    Skin Care Treatment             The Modified EpiDerm SIT eliminates the need for animal testing when used to determine skin irritation potential of chemicals, including raw cosmetic materials. This development allows companies world-wide to comply with new European Union (EU) REACH legislation as well as the EU directive on the protection and welfare of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. This directive (EU 86/609) prohibits the use of animals in experiments if a validated alternative is available.   The Modified EpiDerm SIT will also be of great benefit to the Cosmetic Industry because testing of cosmetic raw materials in animals will be prohibited in the EU beginning March 2009 (7th Amendment of EU Cosmetic Directive).   John Sheasgreen, MatTek's President, added, ""The validation of the Modified EpiDerm SIT involved multiple successful transatlantic tissue shipments from MatTek's US production facility to EU testing laboratories. The ability to ship EpiDerm tissues in this manner is yet another reason why MatTek has become the supplier of choice for both European and US organizations testing safety and efficacy of finished products and ingredients.""   The Modified EpiDerm SIT validation study on which ECVAM based its new statement was performed under the auspices of ZEBET (BfR) in 4 independent EU and US laboratories during 2007. The testing fully complied with all validation rules outlined by OECD and ICCVAM (e.g. independent study management, coded reference chemicals, inclusion of naive laboratory, etc.).

I deserve that,  having survived a hundred thousand years of  You would make a fine-looking hat . Years take their tollhe right ovary that goes on the fritz every time, flat feet, and that  tangled mess of our sex: ten different kinds  of X, Y, and yeah, blind dates tend to be  a disaster.

To be  a mom must suck , or so the saying goes,  except we've got no teatsnly a kind  of belly-gulley, where milk pools so that the platypups can lap it up. Take that, Disney. Bambi's mom was never a deer  daiquiri. Takes a particular kind  of woman to do that for seven years, twins every time, while the deadbeat dad goes  back to his bachelor pad. He must be so satisfiedazy as a queen beebr />stroking his only weapons, hind spurs that  barnacled to his ankles. Out he goes  with enough venom to kill angry deer, but would he save me from hunters? No.Years  teach me not to expect a card, a kind Mother's Day word, or flowers of any kind.  There's no alimony in the wild, beware.  Even minor developments take years.  But evolution's crawl has its perks: that  way I track electric waves, swift as deer,  swiveling to go as the hot shrimp goes, each soul-spark a kind of beacon. If that  makes me the bad guy, Disney, be a dear:  wait a thousand years, then see how it goes.

Three stray cats dart into spindly elms that split the reeking bins from the railroad tracks beyond. At night, steel freighters thunder through here, jittering loose windows, sounding their low drone that strikes the heart anvil like longing. This is the sort of place you live when you don know where to go--young couples dreaming lifetimes in their first shared beds, guys who know too much about kung fu films, or the just-divorced getting by between visitation Sundays. Ie grown to hate this sameness, the nowhere feel of modest brick, communal lawn plots, strip malls of the soul. But tonight the big moon stops me cold; haloing the slate October sky and whisped by clouds, like the sky I saw one autumn as a child, after a nightmare kept me up, my step-dad laced his boots and walked with me around our northern town to help me sleep, he said. Down past dark houses to the street of empty shops that faced the shore; far below, I knew, black waves of Lake Superior rushed the rocky crags. In the quiet night that already smelled of snow we heard the constant, churning undertow. And the moon looked near enough to touch the unleafed limbs or if I stretched my palm, I might feel its scarred and dusty face, so many miles from home.

Crepuscular and nipple-less, they suckle hatchlings in the changeling duskbr /> Diaphanously the god-swan boned a married chick and she begot two eggs, neither good. The launching of a thousand ships ensued.  Homer never saw a platypus, though in his dreams he may have heard them growl,  a noise between a gurgle and a hiss. The males are venomous. A plural form of platypus does not exist.

He insulated their house with it. She was interested in the transparence of her skin. He walled the bathroom with barn-siding, he built the couch with wood he had chopped.

Once, while asleep, he said he half-shut eye of the moon She spoke about the possible precision of doubt. He knew when the wind changed what weather it would bring. She baked bread, made jam from sugar berries, kept a notebook with what she called little collections of her breath. He said the angle the nail goes in is crucial. She fed the ducks, called them her sentient beings. She wondered how one becomes a casualty of desire. He said a tin roof in summer sends back the sun heat. She made wine from dandelions.

Not a old feedsack quilt, but a Wreath of Hollyhocks, cut from Aunt Zelly's pattern and done up from a piece of double-pink Mama brought me from Kermit, soft Nile green for the leaves, and new bleached muslin to put it on. I quilted every inch, stitches no bigger than a speck of meal. He wasn't home, night I finished. I put it on the bed, took my clothes, and got under it. When I heard him in the kitchen, I called and told him it was done, And you know what Mama says, Harlan, you get a wish, first night under a new quilt. It got real quiet, then here he come running. I'd put out the light, he knocked his shin on the cedar chest trying to get to me on the bed. I was fixing to fold it up, get it out of my sight, when the siren blowed. I didn't go. I already knowed. The quilt was ruint. Big oily smudges and coal-black handprints where he hadn't finished washing up. I cried and carried on so when I seen it that morning he couldn't look at me before he left, it made him feel so dirty and bad. I turned the quilt over on the bed to keep them on me, Harlan's hands.  Diane Gilliam Fisher *************** Poet Diane Gilliam Fisher refuses to shy away from the complexities of history, instead using story to illuminate a multiplicity of truths. Her newest work, Kettle Bottom, re-imagines the West Virginia coal mine wars of 1920921 through the voices of immigrant, miners, and their families. In taking on the voice of each character that populates the work larger historical narrative, Fisher brings intimacy, immediacy and compassion to the retelling of a violent time. In Eleanor Wilner words, isher makes the stone of the West Virginia mountains yield up its human past and gives a second, enduring life through her art to the people of her home place, who would otherwise be ll gone under the hill.  Her earlier, more directly autobiographical collection, One of Everything, relates the stories of the women in Fisher family. er language,writes Wilner, arries a particularizing, living presence, stripped of everything false. These deeply-felt, wide-awake, powerful poems are a touchstone for the genuine. Fisher, whose family was a part of the Appalachian outmigration from West Virginia and Kentucky, was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. She received an Individual Artist Fellowship from the Ohio Arts Council in 2003, and Kettle Bottom received the 2004 Intro Award from Perugia Press, a poetry publisher based in Florence, MA. Fisher holds a Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literature from The Ohio State University and an MFA from the Warren Wilson Program for Writers. She lives in Brimfield, Ohio with her husband and children.  ***************   RL       Read entry  |  Discuss  (7 comments) |  Recommend  (0 votes)                                       The RetroLounge Daily Poem Thread (Sun 1/11/2009)            Posted by  RetroLounge  in  The DU Lounge            Sun Jan 11th 2009, 10:42 AM               For a Senior Killed on Prom Night  It's useless to pretend you would have been  a genius. I taught you and I know.  You made the team, but others made it win.  A ready smile made up for being slow. You'd have been ordinary in the end: the hardest worker someone ever had, one woman's husband and one man's best friend,  recipient of cards for ""world's best dad."" So why, where you'd have been, is there a blank  so huge, a hole where all thoughts go to die?  The world has only lost one of its rank  and file. You didn't even make me cry. Why do I go outside at one a.m. and search the stars as though I'd numbered them?

Whatever it was, it nice to be curled this morning, naked on your lap, lit up fuzz of your thighs tickling me underneath, the tang of a new plum ripe in my mouth, sweet and firm with possibility.

He hoots and coos, and she lowers her long delicate neck. Yesterday the man had sunned and swum amid a swarm of nude swimmers in the Riviera cloudy waters, so that now his skin shines pink, his bald spot darkened. He lifts his arms, and the bird lifts her wings. He struts, high-stepping across the pen in which she lived her whole life, and has come to allow this display of a man possible desire. The flutter of black tail feathers raised: her iridescent acquiescence. That low sweeping squawk: her answer of longing. And though the man response is silly, strange, and sadly wrong, it will do to stir her enoughbr />so that whatever he hiding, whatever he holding in his clenched flailing fist like a secret kept too long alone, she can finally let him let goow that she ready to stand still and take whatever that love is he giving.

Somewhere in those partshe coils, the discs,  the blue copper veinsomewhere in that chaos lies the riddle  of sound. Now in the dark kitchen he faces the window  where the first stars tremble in the branches of his oaks.  The house is as quiet as a broken watch.

The new bowl was elongated, svelte, eighty-five pounds of gleaming porcelain muscled up the narrow back stairs, three separate gouges in the bathroom wall where I suggested, scattering unguents and salves, soaps made from oatmeal and apricot, stoppered rose water, bits of beach glass, hairpins, aloe vera and blueing. One enters this kingdom like a guest careful to remain in one own scant preserve, razor, toothbrush and ragged towel kept apart from these occult potions, the jar of chalky pink fluid for the bowels, foot plasters, corn and bunion removers, gels and lotions, aspirin bottles, stockings draped casually over the showerhead like dark mesh for straining opium, lavender powders, shark oil suppositories wrapped in crinkly foil. What hubris to imagine a smooth installation. I managed to donkey the new commode straight down onto its wax ring seal, black sleeve wedged in the drain pipe, its two-inch trapway one hundred percent glazed white vitreous china, fastened in place with solid brass bolts. And I never felt the small collision against my heel in the half step I taken, backward, to admire my labor, knocking the tank from its resting place so it fell over the threshold and broke with a sound like a glacier calving off the Siberian coast . . . I stayed on my knees a long time after that trying to imagine some supplication to the gods of water and household calm which might restore my original vision: to be seated in silence here at last lost in thought or meditating on the perfectibility of man, idly perusing a seed catalogue or intern Abbey,or the diagram of a vagina as it appears on a box of tampons, all the while basking in gratitude for the roughage in last night salad.

Someone got to wash away  that smear of relief and regret.  Someone has to keep the birds in check,  break a few speckled eggs, then cry as if it were all a cruel mistake. Because the eggs  are ruined. Because we never get back  that feeling of lying in the grass, breathing in  the soft earth and the whole of summer before us. We love celebration, the smell of fireworks, but we work too long and forget to pick up milk.  We don notice or agree. And it too easy  to hit someone hand with a ruler. And a hundred times is too many. We need to forge a different taste,  give it a name and shape,  then send an arrow through it. So we can hold  each other. So the phoebe can re-use its nest.

He's tired, a bit depressed, and smelling the exhaustion on his own breath, he kisses her carefully on her left cheek. Early April, and the weather has not decided if this is spring, winter, or what. The two gaze upwards at the sky which gives nothing away: the low clouds break here and there and let in tiny slices of a pure blue heaven. The day is like us, she thinks; it hasn't decided  what to become. The traffic light at Linwood goes from red to green and the trucks start up, so that when he says, ""Would you like to eat?"" she hears a jumble of words that mean nothing, though spiced with things she cannot believe, ""wooden Jew"" and ""lucky meat."" He's been up  late, she thinks, he's tired of the job, perhaps tired of their morning meetings, but when he bows from the waist and holds the door open for her to enter the diner, and the thick  odor of bacon frying and new potatoes greets them both, and taking heart she enters to peer through the thick cloud of tobacco smoke to the see if ""their booth"" is available. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that there were no second acts in America, but he knew neither this man nor this woman and no one else like them unless he stayed late at the office to test his famous one liner, ""We keep you clean Muscatine,"" on the woman emptying his waste basket. Fitzgerald never wrote  with someone present, except for this woman in a gray uniform whose comings and goings went unnoticed even on those December evenings she worked late while the snow fell silently on the window sills and the new fluorescent lights blinked on and off. Get back to the two, you say. Not who ordered poached eggs, who ordered  only toast and coffee, who shared the bacon with the other, but what became of the two when this poem ended, whose arms held whom, who first said ""I love you"" and truly meant it, and who misunderstood the words, so longed for, and yet still so unexpected, and began suddenly to scream and curse until the waitress asked them both to leave. The Packard plant closed years before I left Detroit, the diner was burned to the ground in '67, two years before my oldest son fled to Sweden to escape the American dream. ""And the lovers?"" you ask. I wrote nothing about lovers. Take a look. Clouds, trucks, traffic lights, a diner, work, a wooden shoe, East Moline, poached eggs, the perfume of frying bacon, the chaos of language, the spices of spent breath after eight hours of night work. Can you hear all I feared and never dared to write? Why the two are more real than either you or me, why I never returned to keep them in my life, how little I now mean to myself or anyone else, what any of this could mean, where you found the patience to endure these truths and confessions?

There will be no poems from me for a few days... See you next year... ******************************* Psalm of Snow  I had forgotten how to say yes. That's the trick of heartbreak.  It makes you forget yes. The voices in my head were not kind,  so you took me to the woods to empty out.  My old shoulder was wired with pain, and there was a needle  in my hip, but we lay on a wide flat rock in the snow  as the intoxicated sun licked our faces with breathing light like a yellow dog, simple in its joy, licking our chins and lips and necks  and a long wind came from over the mountaintop  and cooled our left sides, and the Sacramento River  wept through us like time, and spoke its liquid foolish syllables,  senseless, sensual, almost sentient, and I lay with my head  nested between your breasts and listened. Time to climb, you said, and I felt snow-wing angelic as we snowshoed  above Castle Lake, leaving traces behind like snow rabbits  with webbed feet, silver squirrels, prints on the glass of the world,  a little evidence for angels to investigate after that death magic  resolves us to nothing again. I heard omens in the wind, psalms  in the bent warm sunlight that makes the snow mountains weep. Something was coming, something foreign as joy, a clue to how to live once you're done with sorrow, a way of being  in being like a long breath exhaled, leaving a trace on the air  before it resolves again to air, the frozen lake, ice fishers waiting  for something great to rise, the mountaintop lifting  its white head in trance and saying its one good word: snow.

Most cuts and scrapes are minor injuries that can be treated at home. The skin opening may bleed or drain a small amount of fluid.      First-aid for cuts and scrapes:              Calm your child and let him/her know you can help.         Apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage for several minutes to stop bleeding.         Wash your hands thoroughly.         Wash the cut area well with soap and water, but do not scrub the wound. Remove any dirt particles from the area and let the water from the faucet run over it for several minutes. A dirty cut or scrape that is not thoroughly cleaned can cause scarring.         Apply an antiseptic lotion or cream.         Cover the area with an adhesive bandage or gauze pad if the area is on the hands or feet, or if it is likely to drain onto clothing. Change the dressing often.         Check the area each day and keep it clean and dry.         Avoid blowing on the abrasion, as this can cause germs to grow.           When should I call my child's physician?      Specific treatment for cuts and scrapes that require more than minor treatment at home will be determined by your child's physician. In general, call your child's physician for cuts and scrapes that are:              bleeding heavily and do not stop bleeding after five to 10 minutes of direct pressure. If the bleeding is profuse, hold pressure for five to 10 minutes without stopping to look at the cut. If the cloth becomes soaked with blood, put a new cloth on top of the old one. Do not lift the original cloth.         deep or longer than 1/2 inch.         located close to the eye.         large cuts on the face.         caused by a puncture wound, or dirty or rusty object.         embedded with debris such as dirt, stones, or gravel.         ragged or have separated edges.         caused by an animal or human bite.         excessively painful.         showing signs of infection such as increased warmth, redness, swelling, or drainage.           Also call your child's physician if:              your child has not had a tetanus vaccination within the past five years, or if you are unsure when your child's last tetanus shot was given.         you are concerned about the wound or have any questions.

First-aid for superficial cuts and wounds:              Calm your child and let him/her know you can help.         Apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage for several minutes to stop bleeding.         Wash your hands thoroughly.         Wash the cut area well with soap and water, but do not scrub the wound. Remove any dirt particles from the area and let the water from the faucet run over it for several minutes. A dirty cut or scrape that is not thoroughly cleaned can cause scarring.         Apply an antiseptic lotion or cream.         Cover the area with an adhesive bandage or gauze pad. Change the dressing often.         Check the area each day and keep it clean and dry.         Avoid blowing on the abrasion, as this can cause germs to grow.         Any wound to the cartilage of the ear that is more than just a superficial cut or laceration should be evaluated by a physician to decide if stitches or further treatment is needed.         Bruises, blisters, or swollen areas caused by trauma may be treated by placing an ice or cold pack on the area every one to two hours for 10 to 15 minutes for the first 24 hours.         A direct blow or blunt trauma to the ear that causes a large bruise or hematoma (collection of blood and fluid underneath the skin) should be evaluated by a physician to decide if further treatment is needed.         Use a sunscreen (sun protection factor, or SPF, at least 15 or greater) on healed cuts and wounds to help prevent scarring.           When should I call my child's physician?      Specific treatment for cuts and wounds of the ear that require more than minor treatment at home will be determined by your child's physician. In general, call your child's physician for cuts and wounds of the ear that are:              bleeding heavily and do not stop after 5 to 10 minutes of direct pressure. If the bleeding is profuse, hold pressure for 5 to10 minutes without stopping to look at the cut. If the cloth becomes soaked with blood, put a new cloth on top of the old one.

Also call your child's physician if:              your child has not had a tetanus vaccination within the past five years, or if you are unsure when your child's last tetanus shot was given.         you are concerned about the wound or have any questions.           Preventing ear injuries:      The following are a few guidelines to help prevent ear injuries in children:              Teach your child not to poke or place objects in the ear, such as cotton swabs or pencils.         Teach your child to wear protective ear guards or helmets for sports activities that could cause injury.         Have your child's ears pierced professionally and take care of them afterwards, according to the instructions given.

Others use tattoos and surgeries to shift their appearance from human to animal. Examples are  Stalking Cat Dennis Avner  as well as  Katya and The Enigma .           Since tattoos involve needles and  blood , they carry several risks. These include transmission of diseases like  hepatitis , tuberculosis and possibly HIV. When tattoo artists follow all the correct sterilization and sanitation procedures, risks for disease transmission are relatively low. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), there has not been a documented case of  HIV  transmission from a tattoo. However, doctors warn that non-sterile tattooing practices can lead to the transmission of  syphilis , hepatitis B and other infectious organisms.   Infections can occur in new tattoos, especially without appropriate aftercare. Some people also experience  allergic  reactions to tattoo inks. Although the pigments used may have U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for other purposes, the FDA does not regulate tattoo inks. Finally, some people experience pain or burning during  magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) examinations because of metallic pigments. Some doctors have also reported interference and distorted MRI images from permanent makeup pigments.           Ancient Tattoos    Tattoos found on Egyptian and Nubian  mummies  date from about 2000 B.C.          In addition, most states place restrictions on whether people who have tattoos can donate  blood . Because of the danger of hepatitis, the  American Red Cross  will not accept blood from someone who has been tattooed in the past year unless the tattoo parlor is state-regulated. Most states do not regulate tattoo parlors. [Source:  American Red Cross ]    Tattoo professionals use rules known as  universal precautions  to prevent the spread of illnesses during tattooing. These precautions are part of the  Bloodborne Pathogens Rule  issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The same rules apply to hospitals and doctors' offices. The  CDC  is a good resource for information about universal precautions.            Precautions for tattoo parlors include glove use, sterilization and covering bottles and tools.            Other precautions specific to tattooing include:    Checking gloves for pinhole tears during tattooing, since petroleum-based ointment erodes latex  Pouring ink in advance, using clean tissue to open ink bottles during tattooing and preventing nozzles from touching contaminated surfaces  Patting tubes dry after rinsing during color changes -- never blowing excess water from them  Spraying liquid soap into a tissue, not directly onto bleeding area, since blood can become airborne when the spray hits it    Giving pens used for drawing on the skin, which should be medical grade and sterile, to the client          Tahitian Roots    The word tattoo comes from the Tahitian word  tattau , which means ""to mark,"" and was first mentioned in explorer James Cook's records from his 1769 expedition to the South Pacific.         Tattoo artists must also take special safety measures regarding their hands. Gloves help prevent disease transmission from bodily fluids, but bacteria thrive in the warm, damp environment they create. This means that artists must:     Wash hands thoroughly and often  Inspect hands for cuts or sores and cover them with bandages  Remove hangnails and keep nails short to prevent punctures to gloves  Refrain from tattooing when experiencing lesions, dermatitis or allergic reactions     Laws require minors to have a parent's permission to get a tattoo. So, some adolescents get tattoos from friends or amateurs, who use makeshift tools like pens and paper clips with little if any sanitary precautions. This is extremely dangerous, since proper equipment and sanitary measures protect people from disease and infection.

I tried to freeze it off bu it seems to keep growing. Underneath the skin I can feel a hard ball about the size of a b-b. Should I have it removed? Could it be cancerous? I'm a male, 46 years old. I've seen examples of  skin cancer  and they do not resemble the growth on my arm.

It's a smallish lump ontop of my  arm , though under the skin, and right where my arm  bends . When my arm it out straight, you can see it clearly, but when I bend my arm, it's like it disappears. It is hard, but does not itch nor is it painful. Just confusing!

I started about two months ago.  I thought it was just a bite.  Now it's grown and looks like a bruise when her arm is bent but when she straightens her arm you can clearly see the lump.  It's grown now and it's about 1.5 inches and Dr is going to remove it ,  but he really doesn't have an explanation for it or even what it is.  It does not hurt or itch her at all.  I'm still very confused?

It's halfway between my elbow and wrist.  It doesn't hurt, doesn't seem to be growing but it isn't going away either.  If anyone gets additional information on what this thing is I'm sure we'd ALL appreciate it!  I must add that at 14 yrs of age I had what the Dr called a 'fatty tumor' removed from my  knee .  That had been in/on my knee for as long as I could remember and would ocassionally swell and when touched would shoot off to another location around the knee eventually returning to it's original position.  Maybe these are nothing more than a benign, fatty deposit.

It seems to be sitting on the ridge of my bone on the top half of my forearm. I can push it back and forth but that's all. It doesn't move around from wrist to elbow. It doesn't hurt, but it's a weird sensation. Why can't someone answer what the heck this is.

They used paint for make-up and facial features.  One has gold glitter for an earring.  They added yarn and construction paper hair.  Some was straight, some was curled around a pencil.  They added ribbons and barrettes.  The boys made captions (testimonials) about the hair products to go with the faces.  One read, "" My hair used to be as straight as a flagpole.  Then I used Madam C.J. Walker's Vegetable Shampoo.  Now my hair is as curly as a pig's tail!""  Another  read, ""My head was a bald as a bare tree in winter.  I used Madam C.J. Walkers' products.  Now I am hairier than my dog!""   A paragraph about Ms. Walker is printed to look like an ad from the Charlotte Observer Newspaper from 1910.  It reads:  Madam C.J.

The Titan treatment involves application of a handpiece that generates infrared light energy. The light heats the dermis deep beneath your skin's surface and causes, according to professionals using the Titan device in their practice, ""collagen contraction"" and ""long-term collagen rebuilding"" that generates younger looking skin. TITAN is also known as Cutera Titan, and Titan skin treatment. TITAN pictures   TITAN price map   Considering TITAN?

The Titan heats the dermis to cause collagen contraction while preserving the epidermis through continuous cooling. In addition, Titan can stimulate long-term collagen rebuilding that leaves patients with younger looking skin. The Titan Procedure treats lax and redundant skin throughout the body including the abdomen, thighs and underarms and is also used to tone, lift and tighten skin on the face and neck. The Titan Procedure: Safe, comfortable, non-surgical Treats lax and redundant skin throughout the body Can stimulate long-term collagen rebuilding.          Although non-ablative radiofrequency can produce  skin tightening, significant pain from its application limits the patient population of possible candidates to those with sufficiently high pain tolerance and those willing to undergo significant pain during the procedure. Topical anesthetics are only modestly helpful in lessening this pain. Injectable anesthetics are not recommended due to the possibility of altering the local impedance of tissues, causing an unwanted burn. Producing painless skin tightening via non-ablative radiofrequency is not yet possible unless the patient is deeply sedated or receives systemic anesthesia. A new non-ablative medical device: Titan (Cutera, Inc. Brisbane, CA) has been successful in producing skin contraction leading to lifting of eyebrows and/or improvement of lower face and neck skin laxity. This device has also been used successfully in other body areas such as abdomen, arms and thighs. Immediate changes have been noticed in the vast majority of patients. The degree of pain is quite low, to the point of needing no anesthesia. Patient satisfaction has been remarkable. There is no down time and no incisions or scars either. Additionally, the patient will look like himself after the procedure. The results have a remarkable natural look which, plastic surgery rarely can match. The patient will look less tired, with a freshened look. The skin contraction achieved is in the order of 1 to 3 millimeters. It may not sound dramatic, but the changes induced by such contraction are perceptible and significant when it comes to eyebrow lifting or fading of the naso-labial fold. follow-up visits show that the improvement has been maintained and even increased. In fact, the degree of improvement has not diminished during follow-up in any of our patients. post operative Patients can go back to their normal activities right away. The new Titan system from Cutera has a similar thermal profile in ex-vivo skin specimens detected by thermal photography. It also has significant advantages over non-ablative radiofrequency. For one thing it has a multi-second pulse which provides a gentle and sustained skin heating that clinically is much less painful and has similar if not better clinical results.  The safety profile is very good with adequate physician training and the results are as satisfactory as can be expected with any modern technology in this field                                    Before                                    Immediately after Titan treatment same day                                       Before                                 After 24 days of Titan facelift                                    Before                                After one treatment                                                                                    Before                                                                                    After one treatment                                     Before                                  After one treatment same day                          Before ( Upper eye lids and eye brows)             Six weeks after one treatment                                                                                         Before                      Six weeks after one treatment                                                                Eye bags before          Eye bags after one Titan treatment             Titan in the news - click the link below for Titan news articles                                                                                                                     Titan skin tightening in news                   Titan Global Press Coverage                                                                                                                                                                                                                            [ skin Laser Dubai ] [ Profile ] [ Laser Hair Removal ] [Titan] [ Laser Skin Surgery ] [ Q Laser ] [ Laser Resurfacing ] [ Vitiligo&Psoriasis Laser ] [ TCA Peel ] [ Fractional Laser ] [ Pearl Laser ] [ Acne ] [ Acne Scars ] [ Vascular Laser ] [ Laser genesis ] [ smart Lipo ] [ Accu tip ] [ Ultracontour ] [ Lipodissolve ] [ Skin Cancer ] [ Sexual Dysfunction ] [ Sexual diseases ] [ Skincare Tips ] [ Comments ] [ Before& After ] [ Before&After2 ] [ Contact us ]
