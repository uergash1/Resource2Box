Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

The  archipelago  is located some 1,750 km east of  Australia , north-east of  New Caledonia , west of  Fiji  and south of the  Solomon Islands .

The first  European  explorer to reach the islands was  Spaniard   Pedro Fernndez de Quiros  in  1606 . After  James Cook  also visited the islands in the late  18th century , Europeans started to settle on the islands.   In  1906 , the  French  and  British  agreed to a  Anglo-French Condominium  on the  New Hebrides , as the islands were then known. In the  1960s , the Vanuatuan people started to press for self-government and later independence, which was finally granted by both European nations on  July 30 ,  1980 .   During the  1990s , Vanuatu experienced some political instability, which eventually resulted in a more de-centralised government.     Politics     Main article:  Politics of Vanuatu    The parliament of Vanuatu is unicameral, and has 52 members. These are elected every four years by popular vote. The leader of the main party in the parliament is usually appointed prime minister, and heads the government. The chief of state, the president, is chosen by the parliament and regional councils every five years.     Provinces     Main article:  Provinces of Vanuatu    Vanuatu has six provinces:         Malampa     Penama      Sanma      Shefa     Tafea     Torba        Geography     Main article:  Geography of Vanuatu        Vanuatu consists of 83 islands, of which two - Matthew and Hunter - are also claimed by the French oversea department of  New Caledonia . Most of the islands are mountainous and of volcanic origin, and have a  tropical  or sub-tropical  climate .   The nation's largest towns are the capital  Port Vila , which is situated on  Efate , and  Luganville , on  Espiritu Santo .     Economy     Main article:  Economy of Vanuatu    The economy is based primarily on subsistence or small-scale agriculture, which provides a living for 65% of the population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with about 50,000 visitors in 1997, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. A severe earthquake in November 1999 followed by a tsunami, caused extensive damage to the northern island of Pentecote and left thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused extensive damage in the capital, Port-Vila, and surrounding areas, and also was followed by a tsunami. GDP growth rose less than 3% on average in the 1990s. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002 the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism. Australia and New Zealand are the main suppliers of foreign aid.   Vanuatu is a tax haven that doesn't release account information to other governments and law enforcement agencies. In Vanuatu there is no income tax, no withholding tax, no capital gains tax, no death duties and no exchange controls.     Demographics     Main article:  Demographics of Vanuatu    Most of the inhabitants of Vanuatu (95%) are native  Melanesian , or  Ni-Vanuatu , with the remainder made up of Europeans, Asians and other Pacific islanders. There are three official languages in Vanuatu,  English ,  French  and  Bislama , which is a  pidgin  of English. In addition over a hundred local languages are spoken on the islands.    Christianity  is the predominant religion in Vanuatu, although there are a lot of denominations. The  Presbyterian Church , adhered by about one third of the population, is the largest of them.

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives. In its later years, the Civil Rights Movement took a sharp turn to the  radical left  in many cases.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence. SMH     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues. Neka Waz Here     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.       [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with about 50,000 visitors in 2004, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. GDP growth rose less than 3% on average in the 1990s. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002 the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a second target for growth. Australia and New Zealand are the main suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives. In its later years, the Civil Rights Movement took a sharp turn to the  radical left  in many cases.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Second-wave feminism  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issue of economic equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. One phenomenon included the recognition of  lesbian  women within the movement, due to the simultaneous rise of the  gay rights  movement, and the deliberate activism of lesbian feminist groups, such as the  Lavender Menace .   The developments led to explicit  lesbian feminist  campaigns and groups, and some feminists went further to argue that heterosexual sexual relationships automatically subordinated women, and that the only true independence could come in lesbian relationships ("" lesbian separatism ""). The second wave is sometimes linked with  radical feminist  theory. One interesting and underdocumented aspect of the second-wave was the rise of women's cooperative living communities. An example of one such intentional community was the Chatanika River Women's Colony.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Second-wave feminism  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issue of economic equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. One phenomenon included the recognition of  lesbian  women within the movement, due to the simultaneous rise of the  gay rights  movement, and the deliberate activism of lesbian feminist groups, such as the  Lavender Menace .   The developments led to explicit  lesbian feminist  campaigns and groups, and some feminists went further to argue that heterosexual sexual relationships automatically subordinated women, and that the only true independence could come in lesbian relationships ("" lesbian separatism ""). The second wave is sometimes linked with  radical feminist  theory. One interesting and underdocumented aspect of the second-wave was the rise of women's cooperative living communities. An example of one such intentional community was the Chatanika River Women's Colony.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The government finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day, the Catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.     The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence. SMH     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of student strikes that broke out at a number of universities and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

In civil law jurisdictions, lawsuits between private parties for things such as breach of contract or a tort are usually expressed in terms of infringement of a civil right.   In common law jurisdiction, the term civil right is distinguished from ""human rights"" or ""natural rights"". Civil rights are rights that are bestowed by nations on those within their terr boundaries, while natural or human rights are rights that many scholars claim that individuals have by nature of being born.    Find Law Firms for Civil Rights           Civil Rights - US     Civil Rights - Wex   A civil right is an enforceable right or privilege, which if interfered with by another gives rise to an action for injury. Examples of civil rights are freedom of speech, press, and assembly; the right to vote; freedom from involuntary servitude; and the right to equality in public places.   Civil Rights - Wikipedia   Civil rights refers to two related but different terms. In civil law jurisdictions, a civil right is a right or power which can be exercised under civil law, which includes things such as the ability to contract. In civil law jurisdictions, lawsuits between private parties for things such as breach of contract or a tort are usually expressed in terms of infringement of a civil right.   Civil Rights Act of 1964 - Wikipedia   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a landmark piece of legislation in the United States that outlawed segregation in schools, public places, and employment. First conceived to help African Americans, the bill was amended prior to passage to protect women, and explicitly included white people for the first time.   Civil Rights Era: African American Odyssey   The post-war era marked a period of unprecedented energy against the second class citizenship accorded to African Americans in many parts of the nation. Resistance to racial segregation and discrimination with strategies such as civil disobedience, nonviolent resistance, marches, protests, boycotts, ""freedom rides,"" and rallies received national attention as newspaper, radio, and television reporters and cameramen documented the struggle to end racial inequality.   Civil Rights Section - FBI   The FBI is the lead agency for investigating violations of federal civil rights lawsnd we take that responsibility seriously. Why? Because as Director Mueller has said, hen just one of us loses just one of our rights, then the freedoms of all of us are diminished./p>   Civil Rights Timeline   Milestones in the modern civil rights movement.   Corruption of Civil Rights and Civil Law   The concepts of ""civil rights"" and of ""civil law"" are both functions of the concept of ""civil society"": Civil society is that sphere of private action free of government control. It is not free of government action, because government action secures the nature of civil society by the protection of persons against criminal wrongs.   Enforcement of Civil Rights Law in Private Workplaces: The Effects of Compliance Reviews and Lawsuits Over Time   Has federal antidiscrimination law been effective in moving women and minorities into management? Early studies show that government affirmative action reviews improved the numbers, and rank, of blacks, but evidence of what has happened since 1980 is sparse. There is little evidence that civil rights lawsuits improved the employment status of women or African Americans. We examine establishment-level effects of compliance reviews and lawsuits on the percentage of women and blacks in management.   Federal Voting Rights Laws   The Voting Rights Act, adopted initially in 1965 and extended in 1970, 1975, and 1982, is generally considered the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever adopted by the United States Congress. The Act codifies and effectuates the 15th Amendment's permanent guarantee that, throughout the nation, no person shall be denied the right to vote on account of race or color.   Leadership Conference on Civil Rights   This website provides information and resources on civil rights, such as affirmative action, voting rights, housing, welfare and more.   Right to a Fair Trial   Every person has the right to a fair trial both in civil and in criminal cases, and the effective protection of all human rights very much depends on the practical availability at all times of access to competent, independent and impartial courts of law which can, and will, administer justice fairly.   Right to Vote   Without free and fair elections, there can be no democratic society, and without that constant accountability of government officials to the electorate, there can, in fact, be no assurance of any other rights. The right to vote, therefore, is not only an important individual liberty; it is also a foundation stone of free government.   The American Civil Rights Union   Civil rights are the fundamental liberties that all Americans should enjoy as a matter of basic morality, as well as Constitutional protection. Several organizations exist to protect one aspect or another of our civil rights and liberties. But the American Civil Rights Union (ACRU) is dedicated to protecting our fundamental rights and liberties across the board.    U.S Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights   The Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights is a bipartisan organization established in 1982 to monitor the civil rights policies and practices of the federal government and to seek ways to accelerate progress in the area of race relations and on other civil rights issues.   U.S. - Are America Civil Rights Laws Still Relevant?   The federal government created America historic 1964 Civil Rights Act during a period of low immigration. The primary goal was to create equal opportunities for African Americans by ending Jim Crow discrimination in the South.   U.S. Commission on Civil Rights   The mission of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is to investigate complaints alleging that citizens are being deprived of their right to vote by reason of their race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin, or by reason of fraudulent practices; to study and collect information relating to discrimination or a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Constitution because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin, or in the administration of justice.   U.S. Department of Justice - Civil Rights Division   The Civil Rights Division is committed to upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, including some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Founded in 1957, we celebrate our 50th Anniversary next year. Our proud mission remains vitally important today. The federal anti-discrimination statutes that we enforce reflect some of America highest ideals and aspirations: equal treatment and equal justice under law.   What is Fair Trial?   The right to a fair trial is a norm of international human rights law designed to protect individuals from the unlawful and arbitrary curtailment or deprivation of other basic rights and freedoms, the most prominent of which are the right to life and liberty of the person.         Civil Rights - Europe     Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union   This website contains the complete text of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, as signed and proclaimed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 December 2000.   Civil and Political Rights - Europe in Transition and Conflict   One of the main areas of focus of the Institute is the protection of fundamental civil and political rights in the former Soviet states and in regions of current or recent conflict within Europe. In these contexts, the Institute carries out research, provides consultancy and training, and maintains an international human rights litigation practice.   Data Protection Law in Europe   Data protection is a type of privacy protection manifesting in special legal regulation. Data protection right ensures a person the right of disposal over all data in connection with his personality. This way it serves to sustain the protection of privacy in a world where the possibility of collecting, storing and conciliation of large pools of data is widely available.   Data Retention and Privacy Rights   Behind closed doors, representatives of the Council of Ministers of Justice (JHA Council), representatives from the Commission and the leaders in the European Parliament of the social-democrat and Christian-democrat groups have agreed to introduce an unprecedented law (directive) on mandatory data retention in the EU.   Digital Civil Rights in Europe   European Digital Rights was founded in June 2002. Currently 28 privacy and civil rights organisations have EDRI membership. They are based or have offices in 17 different countries in Europe. Members of European Digital Rights have joined forces to defend civil rights in the information society. The need for cooperation among organizations active in Europe is increasing as more regulation regarding the internet, copyright and privacy is originating from European institutions, or from International institutions with strong impact in Europe.   European Union and Citizenship Rights in the United Kingdom   This paper asks what effects Europeanization has on the citizenship rights of the people of the United Kingdom's different jurisdictions. It uses T H Marshall threefold division of social rights- into civil, political, and social rights- as its framework.   Explanations Relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights   These explanations were originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. They have been updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, in the light of the drafting adjustments made to the text of the Charter by that Convention (notably to Articles 51 and 52) and of further developments of Union law. Although they do not as such have the status of law, they are a valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter.   Right to a Fair Trial - European Union   This handbook is designed to provide readers with an understanding of how legal proceedings at national level must be conducted in order to conform with the obligations under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.   Right to Respect for Private and Family Life, Home and Correspondence - UK   In essence, the incorporation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention) into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) creates a general right to respect for privacy where none previously existed. Article 8 offers general protection for a person private and family life, home and correspondence from arbitrary interference by the State.   Right to Vote and Stand - European Union   The Treaty on European Union (also known as the aastricht Treaty gives every citizen of the Union the right to vote and stand as a candidate in municipal and European elections in the country where he or she lives, under the same conditions as nationals of that country.               Civil Rights - Asia     Civil and Political Rights - China   While paying great attention to the people's right to existence and development, China has also laid stress on ensuring that its citizens enjoy various civil and political rights according to law and that socialist democratic politics be practised and developed.   Civil Code will Advance China's Human Rights Protection   Chinese lawmakers and legal experts said in Beijing Wednesday that the draft civil code which sets out protection for the rights to human dignity and private property, will help push forward China's human rights protection.   Civil Law Development: China and Taiwan   Though the People Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan share a common cultural heritage, their political separation since the late nineteenth century has led to divergent paths of development, evident in their distinct civil legal systems. This article examines the historical development of these civil legal systems, compares their similarities and differences, and evaluates the possibilities for future cooperation between PRC and Taiwanese legal systems.   Civil Law of the People's Republic of China   This Law is formulated in accordance with the Constitution and the actual situation in our country, drawing upon our practical experience in civil activies, for the purpose of protecting the lawful civil rights and interests of citizens and legal persons and correctly adjusting civil relations, so as to meet the needs of the developing socialist modernization.   Civil Rights and Freedoms - Japan   Translation of civil rights according to Japanese law.   Constitutional Right to Peaceful Assembly - Singapore   As the Constitution clearly states that Singaporeans have the right to peaceful assembly as in 14.1.b, one would wonder why the police would normally reject any applications for peaceful public demonstrations in Singapore, regardless of whether it is from political parties, politicians or just any citizens?   Hong Kong Bill of Rights   An Ordinance to provide for the incorporation into the law of Hong Kong of provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as applied to Hong Kong; and for ancillary and connected matters.   Lift Ban on Peaceful Protest - Armenia   The Armenian government should lift new restrictions on freedom of assembly and cease detaining opposition supporters participating in peaceful protests.   Privacy Law Landscapes in Asia   Given the disparate nature of economies and cultures in Asia and the Pacific islands it is unsurprising that there's wide range of legislation (or lack of legislation) and practice compared to Europe.   Status of the Reservation to the Right to Vote in Hong Kong   The Hong Kong government continues to invoke the 1976 reservation to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) entered by the United Kingdom government in relation to Hong Kong. This paper focuses on a major argument proposed by the Hong Kong government before the United Nations Human Rights Committee (HRC) on the issue of universal suffrage.         Civil Rights - International     Freedom Force International   Freedom Force International is a network of men and women from all parts of the world who are concerned over loss of personal liberty and expansion of government power. They are not mere complainers. They have a plan to do something about it. They also share a common belief in The Creed of Freedom, which is a statement of principles that guide them in their mission to build a better world.   International and Regional Human Rights Standards on Freedom of Movement   The right to freedom of movement is a fundamental human right which has found expression and won endorsement in a varied range of human rights and humanitarian protection instruments.   International Center for Transitional Justice   The International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) assists countries pursuing accountability for past mass atrocity or human rights abuse. The Center works in societies emerging from repressive rule or armed conflict, as well as in established democracies where historical injustices or systemic abuse remain unresolved.   International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights   Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI) of 16 December 1966. Entry into force 23 March 1976, in accordance with Article 49.   International Right to Vote   One of the most critical ways that individuals can influence governmental decision-making is through voting. Voting is a formal expression of preference for a candidate for office or for a proposed resolution of an issue. Voting generally takes place in the context of a large-scale national or regional election, however, local and small-scale community elections can be just as critical to individual participation in government.   Universal Jurisdiction   Universal jurisdiction is the principle that every country has an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of grave crimes, no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or their victims.         Civil Rights - Latin America     Constitutional Privacy Framework - El Salvador   Several articles of the Constitution of El Salvador protect the right to privacy, which includes the inviolability of the home, the right to honor, personal and family intimacy, and the right to one's own image. The Constitution also protects the inviolability of any kind of communications by expressly prohibiting wiretapping and provides that any intercepted communication cannot be used in any proceeding, except in insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings.   Equality Under the Law in Latin America   Latin American democracies are based on the idea of self-government and self-collective determination. That means, among other things, that the law receives its authority from the fact that people consent government decisions because that government was elected by them and represents them. However, as we all know, the people do not speak in one voice and in order to identify its political will.   Habeas Data: An update on the Latin America Data Protection Constitutional Right   The individual complaints before a Constitutional Court have a long tradition in the history of the Law. The first complaint that existed, and perhaps the most famous, is the Habeas Corpus (which is roughly translated as ""you should have the body""). It originated on the Middle Ages in England and it is a writ issued by a court commanding that a person held in custody is brought before a court so that it may determine whether the detention is legal.   Human Rights and Press Freedom in Latin America   This Web site is dedicated to the free flow of information and to the interplay between information, human rights and press freedom in Latin America. The project grew out of the landmark conference, Human Rights, Press Freedom and 21st Century Latin America, held at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA in November 1999.   Promoting Equal Protection Under Law in Latin America   Democratic governments cannot last long without respect for the rule of law. Today, Latin America faces this important challenge. Despite over two decades of democracy in most countries, the consolidation of long-lasting democratic government hinges upon ensuring broad-based respect for and access to the rule of law.

These rights can be enforced by court action. Among them are the right to own property, to utilize the courts, to marry, to contract, and to obtain other benefits set out by law, including all rights set out in federal statutes.                             Political Dictionary:    civil rights       Home  >  Library  >  History, Politics & Society  >  Political Dictionary          The political, social, and economic rights that each citizen has by virtue of simply being a citizen, and which are usually upheld by law. The meaning of the phrase is shaded by its commonest reference: to the civil rights of ethnic minorities in the United States. In this and similar usages, there is at least as much stress on the rights of a (minority) group as on the rights of the individual. Nevertheless the phrase is older and more general than the American Civil War. Any state which gives constitutional or legal guarantees to its citizens confers civil rights. However, constitutions sometimes state rights without giving the citizen any means of enforcing them against the state. In the  French Revolution  for instance, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789) was modelled on contemporary American attempts to guarantee certain individual freedoms, which appear in the US Constitution (1787) and its first ten amendments, collectively known as the  bill of rights  (1791). The French Declaration remains in force in that it was incorporated into the preamble to the constitutions of the  Fourth  and  Fifth Republics . However, French practice, unlike American, gives the citizen no legal channel to claim the rights guaranteed in 1789. Both the French and the American declarations guarantee the citizen freedom of speech, assembly, and religion, and also offer procedural guarantees of fair trials and fair taxation. But the American Bill of Rights is part of the Federal Constitution; therefore from 1787 to 1865 it protected citizens only from the federal authorities, not from states or other levels of government. Indeed the Tenth Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights, specifies that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Not until the end of the Civil War were any civil rights against the states guaranteed. Then, the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) outlawed slavery; the  Fourteenth  (1868) extended the rights guarantees in the original constitution and Bill of Rights to the states; and the Fifteenth (1870) forbade the United States or any state to restrict voting rights on the grounds of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It is the programme of these three amendments that has come to summarize civil rights in the United States. Despite the unambiguous language of the three Reconstruction Amendments, civil rights were not protected for almost a century longer. In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, those who had supported the rebellion in the Southern states were disenfranchised, and the state governments were run by carpet-baggers: politicians from the North who packed their belongings in capacious carpet-bags and went to run the Southern states, supported by black votes. Their enemies alleged that they put as much into their carpet-bags to take north with them again. A bargain was struck in 1876 whereby the Republicans were allowed to claim victory in the disputed presidential election of that year on condition that Northern troops were withdrawn from the South. That marked the end for the carpet-baggers, but also for Southern blacks. A succession of discriminatory laws and practices in Southern state laws were upheld by the courts, in spite of their apparently blatant in- consistency with the Reconstruction Amendments. In the key case of  Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana segregation law on the grounds that segregation does not mark the colored race with a badge of inferiority unless the colored race chooses to put that construction on it. The judgment in  Plessy v. Ferguson  was not reversed until the ruling in  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka  (1954) that separate facilities were inherently unequal.  Brown and Baker v. Carr  (1962, enforcing equal-sized electoral districts) were the most important of a series of Supreme Court judgments that restored civil rights in law to what a non-lawyer would believe the Reconstruction Amendments meant. These cases also helped to solidify the doctrine of the incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment, thereby extending its guarantees to the state and local levels. But the Supreme Court commands no armies. Civil rights could not become effective until both the executive and the legislature had also put their weight behind them. The executive did so by sending federal forces to the South to enforce desegregation; the legislature did so by passing, especially, the Civil Rights Act 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 1965. Voting rights have become self-enforcing: now that black citizens have the vote, politicians have to balance their votes against those of white supremacists. Voting rights are now safe, but not all civil rights are. Some parts of the Deep South remain segregated. A difficult problem in civil rights is whether all minorities can, or should, receive equal protection. In 1978 a would-be student, Alan Bakke, complained that his Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated because he had been refused a place whereas minority ethnic group students with poorer qualifications had gained places in the quota which had been set aside for them. In  Regents of the University of California v. Bakke  (1978) a divided Supreme Court held that Bakke had been unlawfully excluded but that  affirmative action  to redress past racial discrimination was not unlawful. Affirmative action continues, notably in higher education, but much more cautiously than before  Bakke . In the United Kingdom, the currency of the term civil rights is largely due to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, which copied American methods in its protests against religious discrimination in the 1960s. Unlike their American counterparts, the Northern Ireland protesters had no constitutionally guaranteed rights, because nobody in the United Kingdom then did. However, UK legislation now bans discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, or (in Northern Ireland only) religion. Thus citizens may enforce some rights against the state, an example being the embarrassment of the UK armed services in the 1990s at having to pay substantial sums in compensation to servicewomen who had been unlawfully dismissed on becoming pregnant. The  European Convention on Human Rights  has now been incorporated into UK law.                              US Government Guide:     civil rights       Home  >  Library  >  History, Politics & Society  >  US Government Guide         Civil rights and civil liberties often mean the same thing. The words are frequently used interchangeably to signify the protection of rights to liberty and equality under the Constitution, such as freedom of speech, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to due process of law. The term  civil rights , however, is also used to refer to positive actions by the government to protect or extend the rights of peopleto provide for individuals or groups opportunities that were previously denied to them. These kinds of civil rights guarantees usually are provided through statutes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which gives the federal government the power to prevent an employer from denying a job to someone because of the person's race, gender, religion, or ethnic origin. Civil rights movements are organized efforts to obtain long-denied constitutional rights for individuals and groups such as African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and women. These segments of the American population have not always enjoyed their full rights of citizenship under the U.S. Constitution. Civil rights legislation For a century after the Civil War, Congress debated, filibustered against, and finally enacted significant civil rights legislation to guarantee the equal rights of African Americans and other minorities. In 1866, Congress passed the first Civil Rights Act over  President Andrew Johnson 's veto. This act granted African Americans full citizenship, thereby reversing the Supreme Court's  Dred Scott  decision of 1857, which had stated that blacks, whether slave or free, were not citizens. When Southern states passed laws requiring segregation by race, Senator Charles Sumner (Republican-Massachusetts) sponsored the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which provided for equal accommodations in hotels, restaurants, trains, and other public facilities. In 1896, the Supreme Court, ruling in  Plessy v. Ferguson , declared this act unconstitutional and upheld racial segregation. The Court ruled that laws permitting, and even requiring their separation in places where they are liable to be brought into contact do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race to the other. Although segregationists never had the votes in Congress to write segregation into national law, they were able to protect it by filibustering. During most of the 20th century, the civil rights movement of African Americans has had a strong impact on the advancement of constitutional rights for all Americans, especially those who had been long-suffering victims of unjust discrimination and unfair treatment under the law. The early leader of this civil rights movement was the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People   ( NAACP ) , founded in 1909. After the formation in 1939 of its  Legal Defense Fund   (LDF) , directed by  Thurgood Marshall , the NAACP began to have a steady and significant effect on federal court rulings to obtain and expand the civil rights of African Americans with regard to voting and education. In  Smith v. Allwright  (1944) the Court ruled that a political party (the Democrats in this case) could not exclude blacks from voting in a primary election to nominate party candidates for a subsequent general election. In  Sweatt v. Painter  (1950) the Court decided that a state may not deny admission of qualified blacks to a state law school on the grounds that a separate law school for blacks is available. The biggest breakthrough came with the legal victory, led by Thurgood Marshall and other NAACP attorneys, in  Brown v. Board of Education  (1954), which established that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. After the  Brown  decision, various  African-American  civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, launched political protest movements to influence enforcement of the  Brown  decision and to demand that the federal government pass laws to protect and promote civil rights for African Americans. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the  Southern Christian Leadership Conference   (SCLC) , which he led, moved to the forefront. In 1957, Senate majority leader Lyndon B. Johnson (DemocratTexas) took credit for passing the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, but Southern opponents had severely weakened this measure by adding an amendment that required jury trials for offenders. Since Southern juries were still likely to be all white, few convictions could be expected. As President in 1964, Johnson led the effort to achieve  cloture  and stop the filibuster against a much stronger civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination in any form of interstate commerce. The next year Johnson proposed, and Congress enacted, the Voting Rights Act to provide federal protection for African Americans right to vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 had a profound impact on American politics, especially in the South, where Southern Democratic officeholders became more attuned to minority constituents, where African Americans were elected to Congress, and where the Republican party once again became a real challenge to the once solid Democratic South. The Civil Rights Act forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, and, in employment, sex. The law provides protection from unfair discrimination in employment and in the use of public facilities. It also requires desegregation of public schools and facilities. The Supreme Court has upheld as constitutional the major provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And the Court has interpreted this law broadly to expand the opportunities available to racial minorities often victimized by past  discriminatory  practices. In  Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States  (1964), for example, the Court established beyond challenge that no person can be excluded, because of race or color, from any facility that is open to the general public. Further, the Court has upheld programs of employers to emphasize recruitment of racial minorities that have suffered from the employer's racial discrimination in hiring in the past. The 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawed discrimination by state governments against African Americans and other minority groups in voter registration and voting in state and federal elections. The Supreme Court upheld the law in  South Carolina v. Katzenbach  (1966), ruling that the law is a constitutional use of Congress's power to enforce the 15th Amendment ban on denying a citizen the right to vote because of the person's race or color. Congress renewed and reinforced this voting rights legislation in 1970, 1975, and 1982. The result has been a dramatic increase in the participation of African Americans in public elections as voters and candidates for government offices. The African-American civil rights movement has become a model for other groups seeking to end legal discrimination against them, such as women, Hispanics, gays, the elderly, and the physically disabled. These groups, too, have tried to bring about favorable legislative acts and judicial decisions. During the 1980s and 1990s, civil rights advocates have promoted affirmative action programsthe use of preferential treatment of racial, ethnic, or gender groups to provide access to education, employment, and other social benefits. The groups seeking and receiving these benefits are seen as having been victims of persistent and unfair discrimination. They look to affirmative action as a temporary means to overcome the harmful consequences of systematic discrimination in the past, which has unfairly denied opportunities to some people. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The purpose was to strengthen the scope of federal civil rights protections, which had been weakened by the Supreme Court's decision in  Ward's Cove Packing Company v. Atonio  (1989). In the  Ward's Cove  decision, the Court determined that those claiming discrimination by employers had to prove that a specific employment practice had been discriminatory. Even if the plaintiff were to provide the proof required, the employer could still claim that the discriminating practice was necessary to maintain his or her business. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 over turned the  Ward's Cove  decision by eliminating, as illegal, an employer's claim of business necessity as a justification for intentional discrimination against an individual based on race, color, ethnic origin, and gender. Further, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 protects an employee against racial harassment after being hired. Finally, the 1991 law limits the opportunities to legally challenge employers affirmative action programs.  See also  Affirmative action ;  Brown v.

The term is broader than political rights, which refer only to rights devolving from the franchise and are held usually only by a citizen, and unlike natural rights, civil rights have a legal as well as a philosophical basis. In the United States civil rights are usually thought of in terms of the specific rights guaranteed in the Constitution: freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press, and the rights to due process of law and to equal protection under the law. Civil Rights in the United States Since the  Civil War , much of the concern over civil rights in the United States has focused on efforts to extend these rights fully to African Americans. The first legislative attempts to assure African Americans an equal political and legal status were the Civil Rights Acts of 1866, 1870, 1871, and 1875. Those acts bestowed upon African Americans such freedoms as the right to sue and be sued, to give evidence, and to hold real and personal property. The 1866 act was of dubious constitutionality and was reenacted in 1870 only after the passage of the  Fourteenth Amendment . The fourth Civil Rights Act attempted to guarantee to the African Americans those social rights that were still withheld. It penalized innkeepers, proprietors of public establishments, and owners of public conveyances for discriminating against African Americans in accommodations, but was invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1883 on the ground that these were not properly civil rights and hence not a field for federal legislation. After the Civil Rights Act of 1875 there was no more federal legislation in this field until the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, although several states passed their own civil-rights laws. The 20th-century struggle to expand civil rights for African Americans involved the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Urban League, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and others. The civil-rights movement, led especially by Martin Luther King, Jr., in the late 1950s and 60s, and the executive leadership provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson, encouraged the passage of the most comprehensive civil-rights legislation to date, the Civil Rights Act of 1964; it prohibited discrimination for reason of color, race, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation covered by interstate commerce, i.e., restaurants, hotels, motels, and theaters. Besides dealing with the desegregation of public schools, the act, in Title VII, forbade discrimination in employment. Title VII also prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act was passed, which placed federal observers at polls to ensure equal voting rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 dealt with housing and real estate discrimination. In addition to congressional action on civil rights, there was action by other branches of the government. The most notable of these were the Supreme Court decisions in 1954 and 1955 declaring racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional and the court's rulings in 1955 banning segregation in publicly financed parks, playgrounds, and golf courses. In the 1960s women began to organize around the issue of their civil rights (see  feminism ). The federal Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963, and by the early 1970s over 40 states had passed equal pay laws. In 1972 the Senate passed an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) intended to prohibit all discrimination based on sex, but after failing to win ratification in a sufficient number of states, the ERA was abandoned. Since the 1970s a number of gay-rights groups have worked, mainly on the local and state levels, for legislation that prevents discrimination in housing and employment (see  gay-rights movement ). In a further extension of civil-rights protection, the  Americans with Disabilities Act  (1990) barred discrimination against disabled persons in employment and provided for improved access to public facilities.

Personal liberties that belong to an individual owing to his or her status as a citizen or resident of a particular country or community.   The most common legal application of the term  civil rights  involves the rights guaranteed to U.S. citizens and residents by legislation and by the Constitution. Civil rights protected by the Constitution include freedom of speech and press and freedom from certain types of  discrimination .   Not all types of discrimination are unlawful and most of an individual's personal choices are protected by the freedom to choose personal associates, to express herself or himself, and to preserve personal privacy. Civil rights legislation comes into play when the practice of personal preferences and prejudices of an individual, a business entity, or a government interferes with the protected rights of others. The various civil rights laws have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, or national origin. Discrimination that interferes with voting rights and equality of opportunity in education, employment, and housing is unlawful.   The term  privileges and immunities  is related to civil rights. Privileges and immunities encompass all rights of individuals that relate to people, places, and real and personal property.  Privileges  include all the legal benefits of living in the United States, such as the freedom to sell land, draft a will, or obtain a divorce.  Immunities  are the protections afforded by law that prevent the government or other people from hindering another's enjoyment of his or her life, such as the right to be free from illegal searches and seizures and the freedom to practice religion without government persecution. The Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the U.S. Constitution states, ""The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."" The clause is designed to prevent each state from discriminating against the people in other states in favor of its own citizens.   The  Bill of Rights , the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, delineates specific rights reserved for U.S. citizens and residents. No state can remove or abridge rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution.   In 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in  Dred Scott v. Sandford,  60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 15 L. Ed. 691, that the Constitution did not apply to African Americans because they were not citizens when the Constitution was written. After the Civil War, therefore, new laws were necessary for the purpose of extending civil liberties to the former slaves.   In 1865, the  Thirteenth Amendment  to the Constitution was enacted to make  slavery  and other forms of  involuntary servitude  unlawful. In addition, Congress was given the power to enact laws that were necessary to enforce this new amendment.   The  Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868, provides that every individual who is born or naturalized in the United States is a citizen and ensures that a state may not deprive a citizen or resident of her or his civil rights, including  due process of law  and  equal protection  of the laws. Congress is also empowered to enact laws for the enforcement of these rights.   The Origin of Federal Civil Rights Laws    In the period immediately following the Civil War civil rights legislation was originally enacted by Congress, based upon its power under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to pass laws to enforce these rights. The first two of these laws were based upon the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C.A. § 1982), which had preceded the Fourteenth Amendment.   The first civil rights law guaranteed  equal rights  under the law for all people who lived within the  jurisdiction  of the United States. The second guaranteed each citizen an equal right to own, inherit, rent, purchase, and sell real property as well as  personal property . The third original civil rights law, the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (17 Stat. 13), provided citizens with the right to sue in  civil action  for a violation of protected rights. The fourth law made violation of such rights a criminal offense.   Subsequent Legislation    Although these initial laws supposedly guaranteed the civil rights of all citizens, including African Americans and other minorities, they were effectively negated for most African Americans in the late nineteenth century by the passage of  Jim Crow laws , or Black Codes, in the South. These laws made it illegal for African Americans to use the same public facilities as whites, restricted their travel, impeded their ability to vote, forbade interracial marriage, and generally relegated them to a legallly inferior position.   In the 1896 landmark case  Plessy v. Ferguson,  163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L. Ed. 256, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a Jim Crow law that required the segregation, or separation, of the races on railroad cars. The Court held that the Louisiana law in question was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as long as the facilities provided for each race were ""  separate but equal ."" This separate-but-equal doctrine was used to support other segregation laws applying to public schools and public facilities.   No significant civil rights legislation was enacted until many decades later when the Commission on Civil Rights was established by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (42 U.S.C.A. § 1975) to monitor and collect facts regarding race relations for consideration by Congress and the president. Subsequently, the Civil Rights Act of 1960 (42 U.S.C.A. § 1971) was passed by Congress. It guarantees that qualified voters have the right to register to vote in any state and that they have the right to sue any person who prevents them from doing so. Voters possess this right to sue regardless of whether the individual who so prevents them is a state official or merely an individual acting like one.   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.A. § 2000a et seq.) is the most comprehensive civil rights legislation in the history of the United States. It contains provisions for parity in the use and enjoyment of public accommodations, facilities, and education as well as federally assisted programs and employment. Title VII of that act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on an employee's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, is regarded as the most inclusive source of employment rights. All employers who have at least fifteen employees, including state and local governments and labor unions, are subject to its provisions, but it does not apply to the federal government, American Indian tribes, clubs, and religious organizations.   The Civil Rights Act of 1968 (25 U.S.C.A. § 1301 et seq.) proscribes discrimination in the sale and rental of most U.S. housing. It also prohibits discrimination in financing arrangements and extends to agents, brokers, and owners. Both the 1964 and 1968 Civil Rights Acts establish the right of an injured party to sue and obtain  damages  from any individual who illegally infringes with a person's civil rights, conspires to deprive others of their civil rights, or abuses either government authority or public office to accomplish such unlawful acts.   In the area of education, a significant civil rights milestone was achieved in 1954 with the Supreme Court's decision in  Brown v. Board of Education,  347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873. In  Brown,  the justices unanimously rejected the separate-but-equal doctrine of  Plessy.  They found that segregating black and white children in different public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Segregation, the Court held, effectively discriminates against African American children by promoting in them a sense of inferiority that limits their opportunities in life. The Court also required that school districts desegregate ""with all deliberate speed."" Integration, or desegregation, of public schools has been a divisive issue ever since. In particular, arguments arise over the practice of busing students a distance to school, a method that has been used, often by court order, to create a better racial balance.   In employment, common law permits an employer or  labor union  to discriminate for a valid reason in its relations with employees, unless otherwise provided by federal or state statute. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (29 U.S.C.A. § 151 et seq.) initially restrained discrimination against employees or job applicants who engage in union activities. Subsequently, the act has been extended through various amendments to prohibit other forms of discrimination, including race and  sex discrimination . In 1963, Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C.A. § 206), which requires that men and women be paid the same wages when they do substantially similar work. The  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC) is the initial forum for claims of illegal employment discrimination. It also publishes advisory guidelines that explain or define the law. Many states have agencies or human rights commissions similar to the EEOC.   The 1980s and Beyond    One result of civil rights legislation is  affirmative action , which is the effort to enforce race and sex classifications when necessary to correct past discriminatory patterns. The ordering of affirmative action requires employers or labor unions to make concerted efforts to hire minorities who have traditionally been discouraged from seeking employment with them. The basis for affirmative action is that if such efforts are not made, discrimination will be perpetuated.   Affirmative action and other attempts to end discrimination raise new questions. For example, have efforts to help minorities and women begun to infringe on the rights of individuals outside of those groups, such as white men? Some argue that affirmative action results in  reverse discrimination,  which is prejudice or bias practiced against a particular person or class of people in order to remedy a pattern of past discrimination against another individual or group of individuals.   After President Ronald Reagan appointed three justices to the Supreme Court during his two presidential terms between 1981 and 1989, the Court proceeded to render more conservative opinions regarding civil rights. For example, in  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,  491 U.S. 164, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989), the Court dealt with the issue of discrimination in the private sector. The Court held that section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 barred only racial discrimination in hiring, not racial harassment while on the job. Minority rights groups were disappointed by the ruling, and saw it as part of a general trend toward making civil rights violations more difficult to prove. However, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who wrote the Court's opinion, stated, ""Neither our words nor our decisions should be interpreted as signaling one inch of retreat from Congress's policy to forbid discrimination in the private, as well as the public, sphere.""   Less controversial have been developments in the area of civil rights for handicapped people. In 1990, President George Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 [codified in scattered sections of 42, 29, 47 U.S.C.A.] [effective 1992]), which was quickly hailed as the most significant civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1990 act prohibits discrimination against  disabled persons  in employment, public accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications. Referred to as the bill of rights for physically and mentally disabled citizens — who were estimated to number 43 million at the time of the act's passage— the act supersedes previous state and local laws and extends protection to any person with a physical or mental impairment that ""substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.""   The act includes many features intended to improve living conditions for those with disabilities. For example, employers, providers of public transportation, and private businesses with public accommodation (such as theaters, restaurants, hotels, and banks) must make ""reasonable accommodations"" for disabled persons. Often such accommodations must include wheelchair access. Also, all commuter and intercity trains are required to have at least one car that is handicapped accessible, and telephone companies must provide relay operators for hearing impaired individuals who use special telecommunications devices.   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 [codified in scattered sections of 42, 29, 2 U.S.C.A.]) marked another important step in civil rights legislation. The act repudiated several U.S. Supreme Court decisions on civil rights; granted women and disabled persons the right to recover money damages under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and granted congressional employees the protection of title VII. Among the Supreme Court decisions overturned by the 1991 act was  Patterson.  Section 101 of the act states that employees may sue for damages experienced through racial discrimination in hiring, promotion, dismissal, and all other terms of employment. The changes in title VII employee discrimination cases entitle plaintiffs to jury trials and allow them to receive damages in addition to back pay.    See:    Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas ;   Civil Rights Acts ;   Dred Scott v. Sandford ;   Ku Klux Klan Act ;   Plessy v. Ferguson ;   Section 1983 ; "

In the United States civil rights are usually thought of in terms of the specific rights guaranteed in the Constitution: freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press, and the rights to due process of law and to equal protection under the law.

The first legislative attempts to assure African Americans an equal political and legal status were the Civil Rights Acts of 1866, 1870, 1871, and 1875. Those acts bestowed upon African Americans such freedoms as the right to sue and be sued, to give evidence, and to hold real and personal property. The 1866 act was of dubious constitutionality and was reenacted in 1870 only after the passage of the  Fourteenth Amendment   Fourteenth Amendment,  addition to the U.S. Constitution, adopted 1868.

It penalized innkeepers, proprietors of public establishments, and owners of public conveyances for discriminating against African Americans in accommodations, but was invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1883 on the ground that these were not properly civil rights and hence not a field for federal legislation.   After the Civil Rights Act of 1875 there was no more federal legislation in this field until the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, although several states passed their own civil-rights laws. The 20th-century struggle to expand civil rights for African Americans involved the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Urban League, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and others. The civil-rights movement, led especially by Martin Luther King, Jr., in the late 1950s and 60s, and the executive leadership provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson, encouraged the passage of the most comprehensive civil-rights legislation to date, the Civil Rights Act of 1964; it prohibited discrimination for reason of color, race, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation covered by interstate commerce, i.e., restaurants, hotels, motels, and theaters. Besides dealing with the desegregation of public schools, the act, in Title VII, forbade discrimination in employment. Title VII also prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex.   In 1965 the Voting Rights Act was passed, which placed federal observers at polls to ensure equal voting rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 dealt with housing and real estate discrimination. In addition to congressional action on civil rights, there was action by other branches of the government. The most notable of these were the Supreme Court decisions in 1954 and 1955 declaring racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional and the court's rulings in 1955 banning segregation in publicly financed parks, playgrounds, and golf courses.

[ 4 ]  The country was under  socialist -based policies for an entire generation from the 1950s until the 1980s. The economy suffered from  extensive regulation ,  protectionism , and public ownership, leading to  pervasive corruption  and  slow growth . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  Since 1991,  continuing economic liberalization  has moved the economy towards a  market-based system . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   As of 2007,  agriculture  is the predominant occupation in India, accounting for 60% of employment. The  service  sector makes up a further 28%,  industry  around 12%. [ 9 ] [ dated info ]  One estimate is that only one in five job-seekers has had any sort of  vocational training . [ 10 ]  The labor force totals  half a billion workers . For output, the agricultural sector accounts for 18% of GDP; the service and industrial sectors make up 54% and 28% respectively. Major agricultural  products  include  rice ,  wheat ,  oilseed ,  cotton ,  jute ,  tea ,  sugarcane ,  potatoes ,  cattle ,  water buffalo ,  sheep ,  goats ,  poultry  and  fish . [ 11 ]  Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery and  software design . [ 11 ]  India's GDP is  $ 1.089 trillion, which makes it the  twelfth-largest  economy in the world [ 12 ]  or  fourth largest  by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates. India's nominal  per capita income  of $977 is ranked  128th  in the world. In the late 2000s, India's  growth  has averaged 7.5% a year, increases which will double the average income within a decade. [ 6 ] Unemployment rate is 7.2% (2007 estimate). [ 13 ] [ 14 ]   Previously a closed economy, India's trade has grown fast. [ 6 ]  India currently accounts for 1.5% of World trade as of 2007 according to the WTO. According to the World Trade Statistics of the WTO in 2006, India's total merchandise trade (counting exports and imports) was valued at $294 billion in 2006 and India's services trade inclusive of export and import was $143 billion. Thus, India's global economic engagement in 2006 covering both merchandise and services trade was of the order of $437 billion, up by a record 72 percent from a level of $253 billion in 2004. India's trade has reached a still relatively moderate share 24% of GDP in 2006, up from 6% in 1985. [ 6 ]   India's recent economic growth has widened  economic inequality  across the country. [ 15 ]  Despite sustained high economic growth rate, approximately 80% of its population lives on less than $2 a day (PPP), more than double the same poverty rate in China. [ 16 ]  Even though the arrival of  Green Revolution  brought end to  famines in India [ 17 ] , 40% of children under the age of three are  underweight  and a third of all men and women suffer from  chronic energy deficiency .

The advent of British colonisation started the colonial period in the 17th century, which ended with  independence  in 1947. The third period stretches from independence in 1947 until now.     [ edit ]   Pre-colonial   The citizens of the  Indus Valley civilisation , a permanent and predominantly urban settlement that flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well planned streets, a drainage system and water supply reveals their knowledge of  urban planning , which included the world's first urban  sanitation  systems and the existence of a form of  municipal government . [ 19 ]          Silver coin minted during the reign of the  Gupta  king  Kumara Gupta I  (AD 41455)       The 1872 census revealed that 99.3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages, [ 20 ]  whose economies were largely isolated and self-sustaining, with agriculture the predominant occupation. This satisfied the food requirements of the village and provided raw materials for hand-based industries, such as  textiles ,  food processing  and  crafts . Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins,  barter  was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while its craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services. [ 21 ]   Religion, especially  Hinduism , and the  caste  and the  joint family  systems, played an influential role in shaping economic activities. [ 22 ]  The caste system functioned much like medieval European  guilds , ensuring the  division of labour , providing for the training of apprentices and, in some cases, allowing manufacturers to achieve narrow specialization. For instance, in certain regions, producing each variety of cloth was the specialty of a particular sub-caste.          Estimates of the per capita income of India (18571900) as per 194849 prices. [ 23 ]       Textiles such as  muslin ,  Calicos ,  shawls , and agricultural products such as  pepper ,  cinnamon ,  opium  and  indigo  were exported to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia in return for gold and silver. [ 24 ]   Assessment of India's pre-colonial economy is mostly qualitative, owing to the lack of quantitative information. One estimate puts the revenue of  Akbar 's  Mughal Empire  in 1600 at   17.5 million, in contrast with the total revenue of Great Britain in 1800, which totalled 16 million. [ 25 ]  India, by the time of the arrival of the British, was a largely traditional agrarian economy with a dominant subsistence sector dependent on primitive technology. It existed alongside a competitively developed network of commerce, manufacturing and credit. After the fall of the  Mughals , India was administered by  Maratha Empire . The Maratha Empire's budget in 1740s, at its peak, was Rs. 100 million. After the loss at Panipat, the Maratha Empire disintegrated into confederate states of Gwalior, Baroda, Indore, Jhansi, Nagpur, Pune and Kolhapur. Gwalior state had a budget of Rs. 30M. However, at this time, British East India company entered the Indian political theatre. Until 1857, when India was firmly under the British crown, the country remained in a state of political instability due to internecine wars and conflicts. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Colonial          An aerial view of Calcutta Port taken in 1945.  Calcutta , which was the economic hub of British India, saw increased industrial activity during  World War II .       Company rule in India  brought a major change in the taxation environment from revenue taxes to property taxes resulting in mass impoverishment and destitution of the great majority of farmers, resulting in numerous famines. [ 27 ]  The economic policies of the  British Raj  effectively destroyed India's large handicrafts industry and caused a massive drain of India's resources. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  An estimate by  Cambridge University  historian Angus Maddison reveals that India's share of the world income fell from 22.6% in 1700, comparable to Europe's share of 23.3%, to a low of 3.8% in 1952. [ 30 ]  It also created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed  property rights  among the colonizers, encouraged  free trade , and created a single currency with  fixed exchange rates , standardized weights and measures,  capital markets , a well developed system of  railways  and  telegraphs , a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference, and a common-law, adversarial legal system. [ 31 ]  India's colonisation by the British coincided with major changes in the world economyindustrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world, [ 32 ]  with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, one of the world's lowest  life expectancies , and low rates of  literacy .   The impact of the British rule on India's economy is a controversial topic. While leaders of the  Indian independence movement , and left-nationalist  economic historians  have blamed colonial rule for the dismal state of India's economy in its aftermath, right-wing historians have countered that India's economic performance was due to various sectors being in a state of growth and decline, resulting from changes brought about by colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialization and  economic integration . [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Independence to 1991   Indian  economic policy  after  independence  was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders' exposure to  Fabian socialism . Policy tended towards  protectionism , with a strong emphasis on  import substitution ,  industrialization ,  state intervention  in labor and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and  central planning . [ 34 ]   Five-Year Plans of India  resembled central planning in the  Soviet Union . Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalized in the mid-1950s. [ 35 ]  Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying  red tape , commonly referred to as  Licence Raj , were required to set up business in  India  between 1947 and 1990. [ 36 ]   Jawaharlal Nehru , the first  prime minister , along with the statistician  Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis , carried on by  Indira Gandhi  formulated and oversaw economic policy. They expected favorable outcomes from this strategy, because it involved both public and private sectors and was based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme  Soviet-style  central command system. [ 37 ] [ dead link ]  The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive  heavy industry  and subsidizing manual, low-skill  cottage industries  was criticized by economist  Milton Friedman , who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers. [ 38 ] [ dead link ]   India's low average growth rate from 194780 was derisively referred to as the  Hindu rate of growth , because of the unfavourable comparison with growth rates in other Asian countries, especially the  ""East Asian Tigers"" . [ 31 ]   The  Rockefeller Foundation 's research in  high-yielding varieties of seeds , their introduction after 1965 and the increased use of  fertilizers  and  irrigation  are known collectively as the  Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self-sufficient in food grains, thus improving  agriculture in India .  Famine in India , once accepted as inevitable, has not returned since the introduction of Green Revolution crops.     [ edit ]   After 1991   Main article:  Economic liberalization in India          Major improvements in educational standards across India has helped its economic rise. Shown here is the  Indian School of Business  at  Hyderabad , ranked number 20 in global MBA rankings by the  Financial Times  of London in 2008 [ 39 ]       In the late 80s, the government led by  Rajiv Gandhi  eased restrictions on capacity expansion for incumbents, removed price controls and reduced corporate taxes. While this increased the rate of growth, it also led to high fiscal deficits and a worsening current account. The collapse of the  Soviet Union , which was India's major trading partner, and the  first Gulf War , which caused a spike in oil prices, caused a major balance-of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of defaulting on its loans. [ 40 ]  India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from  IMF , which in return demanded reforms. [ 41 ]   In response, Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao  along with his finance minister  Manmohan Singh  initiated the  economic liberalisation of 1991 . The reforms did away with the  Licence Raj  (investment, industrial and import licensing) and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of  foreign direct investment  in many sectors. [ 42 ]  Since then, the overall direction of liberalisation has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the  trade unions  and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. [ 43 ]  Since 1990 India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the developing world; during this period, the economy has grown constantly, but with a few major setbacks. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security.   While the credit rating of India was hit by its nuclear tests in 1998, it has been raised to investment level in 2007 by S&P and Moody's. [ 44 ]  In 2003,  Goldman Sachs  predicted that India's GDP in current prices will overtake France and Italy by 2020, Germany, UK and Russia by 2025 and Japan by 2035. By 2035, it was projected to be the third largest economy of the world, behind US and China. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Future predictions   File:IndianEconomicForecast.SVG  In the revised 2007 figures, based on increased and sustaining growth, more inflows into foreign direct investment, Goldman Sachs predicts that ""from 2007 to 2020, Indias GDP per capita in US$ terms will quadruple"", and that the Indian economy will surpass the  United States  (in US$) by 2043. [ 8 ]  Despite high growth rate, the report stated that India would continue to remain a low-income country for several decades but can be a ""motor for the world economy"" if it fulfills its growth potential. [ 8 ]  Goldman Sachs has outlined 10 things that it needs to do in order to achieve its potential and grow 40 times by 2050. These are 1.improve governance 2.raise educational achievement 3.increase quality and quantity of universities 4.control inflation 5.introduce a credible fiscal policy 6.liberalize financial markets 7.increase trade with neighbours 8.increase agricultural productivity 9.improve infrastructure and 10.improve environmental quality. [ 47 ]     [ edit ]   Sectors     [ edit ]   Agriculture   Main articles:  Agriculture in India ,  Forestry in India ,  Animal husbandry in India , and  Fishing in India          Farmers work inside a rice field in  Andhra Pradesh . India is the second largest producer of rice in the world [ 48 ]  and Andhra Pradesh is the 3rd largest rice producing state in India. [ 49 ]       India  ranks second  worldwide in farm output.  Agriculture  and allied sectors like  forestry ,  logging  and  fishing  accounted for 16.6% of the GDP in 2007, employed 60% of the total workforce [ 9 ]  and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic development of India.  Yields  per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in  irrigation , technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since  Green revolution in India . However, international comparisons reveal that the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world. [ 50 ]   India is the largest producer in the world of  milk ,  cashew nuts ,  coconuts ,  tea ,  ginger ,  turmeric  and  black pepper . [ 51 ]  It also has the world's largest  cattle  population (193 million). [ 52 ]  It is the second largest producer of  wheat ,  rice ,  sugar ,  groundnut  and inland  fish . [ 53 ]  It is the third largest producer of  tobacco . [ 53 ]  India accounts for 10% of the world fruit production with first rank in the production of  banana  and  sapota . [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Industry          Industrial plant in a rural area near  Jodhpur , Rajasthan. Industrial growth in India has provided increase employment opportunities across India.       Industry accounts for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. [ 9 ]  However, about one-third of the industrial labour force is engaged in simple  household manufacturing  only. [ 54 ] [ dead link ]  In absolute terms, India  is 16th  in the world in terms of nominal factory output. [ 55 ]  Despite this, India emits only around fifth of the carbon that the United States does. [ 56 ]   Economic reforms brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving  consumer goods . [ 57 ]  Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector, which was usually run by oligopolies of old family firms and required political connections to prosper was faced with foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, focusing on designing new products and relying on low labour costs and technology. [ 58 ]   Textile  manufacturing is the second largest source for employment after agriculture and accounts for 26% of manufacturing output. [ 59 ]   Tirupur  has gained universal recognition as the leading source of hosiery, knitted garments, casual wear and sportswear.

It provides employment to 23% of work force, and it is growing fast, growth rate 7.5% in 19912000 up from 4.5% in 195180. It has the largest share in the GDP, accounting for 55% in 2007 up from 15% in 1950. [ 9 ]   Business services ( information technology ,  information technology enabled services ,  business process outsourcing ) are among the fastest growing sectors contributing to one third of the total output of services in 2000. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialization, and an availability of a large pool of low cost, but highly skilled, educated and fluent English-speaking workers, on the  supply side , matched on the demand side by an increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's service exports, or those looking to  outsource  their operations.  India's IT industry , despite contributing significantly to its  balance of payments , accounted for only about 1% of the total GDP or 1/50th of the total services in 2001 [ 62 ]  However the contribution of IT to GDP increased to 4.8 % in 2005-06 and is projected to increase to 7% of GDP in 2008 [ 63 ] [ 64 ]   Most Indian shopping takes place in open markets and millions of independent grocery shops called kirana. Organized retail such supermarkets accounts for just 4% of the market as of 2008. [ 65 ]  Regulations prevent most foreign investment in retailing. Moreover, over thirty regulations such as ""signboard licences"" and ""anti-hoarding measures"" may have to be complied before a store can open doors.

[ 67 ]   The public sector banks hold over 75% of total assets of the banking industry, with the private and foreign banks holding 18.2% and 6.5% respectively. [ 68 ]  Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks (like encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness), other reforms have opened up the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign players.

[ 70 ]  Shown here is a coal mine in  Jharkhand .       India's total cultivable area is 1,269,219 km (56.78% of total land area), which is decreasing due to constant pressure from an ever growing population and increased urbanisation.   India has a total water surface area of 314,400 km and receives an average annual rainfall of 1,100 mm.  Irrigation  accounts for 92% of the water utilisation, and comprised 380 km in 1974, and is expected to rise to 1,050 km by 2025, with the balance accounted for by industrial and domestic consumers. India's inland water resources comprising rivers, canals, ponds and lakes and marine resources comprising the east and west coasts of the  Indian ocean  and other  gulfs  and  bays  provide employment to nearly 6 million people in the  fisheries  sector. In 2008, India had the world's third largest fishing industry. [ 71 ]   India's major  mineral  resources include  Coal  (3rd-largest reserves in the world),  Iron  ore,  Manganese ,  Mica ,  Bauxite ,  Titanium  ore,  Chromite ,  Natural gas ,  Diamonds ,  Petroleum ,  Limestone  and  Thorium  (world's largest along  Kerala 's shores). India's  oil reserves , found in  Bombay High  off the coast of  Maharashtra ,  Gujarat ,  Rajasthan  and in eastern  Assam  meet 25% of the country's demand. [ 72 ] [ 9 ]   Rising energy demand concomitant with economic growth has created a perpetual state of energy crunch in India. India is poor in oil resources and is currently heavily dependent on coal and foreign oil imports for its energy needs. Though India is rich in  Thorium , but not in  Uranium , which it might get access to in light of the nuclear deal with US. India is rich in certain energy resources which promise significant future potential - clean / renewable energy resources like  solar ,  wind , biofuels (jatropha, sugarcane).     [ edit ]   Globalization   Main article:  Globalization in India          Indian exports in 2006       Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledging economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while  foreign direct investment  was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector.   India currently accounts for 1.2% of World trade as of 2006 according to the WTO. [ 73 ]  Despite reducing import restrictions several times in the 2000s, [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   International trade  as a proportion of GDP reached 24% by 2006, up from 6% in 1985 and still relatively moderate. [ 6 ] [ 76 ]  India was evaluated by the World Trade Organization in 2008 as more restrictive than similar developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and Russia. The WTO also identified electricity shortages and inadequate transportation infrastructure as significant constraints on trade.  [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ]   Since independence, India's  balance of payments  on its  current account  has been negative.     Share of top five investing countries in FDI inflows.

[ 6 ]  A number of changes were approved on the FDI policy to remove the caps in most sectors. Fields which require relaxation in FDI restrictions include civil aviation, construction development, industrial parks, petroleum and natural gas, commodity exchanges, credit-information services and mining. But this still leaves an unfinished agenda of permitting greater foreign investment in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing. FDI inflows into India reached a record US$19.5bn in fiscal year 2006/07 (April-March), according to the government's Secretariat for Industrial Assistance. This was more than double the total of US$7.8bn in the previous fiscal year. The FDI inflow for 2007-08 has been reported as $24bn [ 82 ]  and for 2008-09, it is expected to be above $35 billion. [ 83 ]  A critical factor in determining India's continued economic growth and realizing the potential to be an economic superpower is going to depend on how the government can create incentives for FDI flow across a large number of sectors in India.

As of 2005, 85.7% of the population lives on less than $2.50 (PPP) a day, down from 92.5% in 1981. This compares with 80.5% in  Sub-Saharan Africa . [ 87 ]  75.6% of the population lives on less than $2 a day (PPP), which is around 20 rupees or $0.5 a day in nominal terms. It was down from 86.6% and compares with 73.0% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

[ 87 ] [ 92 ]  41.6% of its population is living below the new international poverty line of $1.25 (PPP) per day, down from 59.8% in 1981. [ 87 ]  The World Bank further estimates that a third of the global poor now reside in India.   Today, more people afford to a  bicycle  than ever before. Some 40% of Indian households owns a bicycle, with ownership rates ranging from around 30% to 70% at state level. [ 93 ]  Housing is still very modest. According to Times of India, ""a majority of Indians have per capita space equivalent to or less than a 10 feet x 10 feet room for their living, sleeping, cooking, washing and toilet needs."" and ""one in every three urban Indians lives in homes too cramped to exceed even the minimum requirements of a prison cell in the US."" [ 94 ]  The average is 103 sq ft per person in rural areas and 117 sq ft per person in urban areas. [ 94 ]   Around half of Indian children are malnourished. The proportion of underweight children is nearly double that of Sub-Saharan Africa. [ 18 ] [ 95 ]  However, India has not had  famines  since the  Green Revolution  in the early 1970s. While poverty in India has reduced significantly, official figures estimate that 27.5% [ 96 ]  of Indians still lived below the national poverty line of $1 (PPP, around 10 rupees in nominal terms) a day in 2004-2005. [ 97 ]  A 2007 report by the state-run National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) found that 65% of Indians, or 750 million people, lived on less than 20 rupees per day [ 98 ]  with most working in ""informal labour sector with no job or social security, living in abject poverty."" [ 99 ]   Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under  planning , to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. All these programmes have relied upon the strategies of the  Food for work  programme and  National Rural Employment Programme  of the 1980s, which attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. [ 100 ]  In August 2005, the  Indian parliament  passed the  Rural Employment Guarantee Bill , the largest programme of this type in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of  India's 600 districts . The question of whether economic reforms have reduced poverty or not has fuelled debates without generating any clear cut answers and has also put political pressure on further economic reforms, especially those involving the downsizing of labour and cutting agricultural subsidies. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]     [ edit ]   Employment   See also:  Indian labour laws   Agricultural and allied sectors accounted for about 57% of the total workforce in 19992000, down from 60% in 199394. While agriculture has faced stagnation in growth, services have seen a steady growth. Of the total workforce, 8% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in the public sector. The NSSO survey estimated that in 19992000, 106 million, nearly 10% of the population were unemployed and the overall unemployment rate was 7.32%, with rural areas doing marginally better (7.21%) than urban areas (7.65%). India's labor force is growing by 2.5% every year, but employment is growing only at 2.3% a year. [ 103 ]   India's labor force is growing by 2.5% every year, but employment is growing only at 2.3% a year. [ 103 ]  Official unemployment exceeds 9%. Regulation and other obstacles have discouraged the emergence of formal businesses and jobs. Almost 30% of workers are casual workers who work only when they are able to get jobs and remain unpaid for the rest of the time. [ 103 ]  Only 10% of the workforce is in regular employment. [ 103 ]  India's labor regulations are heavy even by developing country standards and analysts have urged the government to abolish them. [ 6 ] [ 104 ]   Unemployment in India is characterized by chronic  underemployment  or  disguised unemployment . Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and unemployment (which in recent decades has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods) attempt to solve the problem, by providing financial assistance for setting up businesses, skill honing, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decreased role of the public sector after liberalization has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and has also put political pressure on further reforms. [ 105 ] [ 100 ]   Child labor  is a complex problem that is basically rooted in poverty. The Indian government is implementing the world's largest child labor elimination program, with primary education targeted for ~250 million. Numerous non-governmental and voluntary organizations are also involved. Special investigation cells have been set up in states to enforce existing laws banning employment of children (under 14) in hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for the eradication of  child labor  was $10 million in 1995-96 and $16 million in 1996-97. The allocation for 2007 is $21 million. [ 106 ]   In 2006,  remittances  from Indian migrants overseas made up $27 billion or about 3% of India's GDP. [ 107 ]     [ edit ]   Development issues     [ edit ]   Agriculture   Main article:  Agriculture in India     Slow agricultural growth is a concern for policymakers as some two-thirds of Indias people depend on rural employment for a living. Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation.     World Bank: ""India Country Overview 2008"" [ 108 ]     The low productivity in India is a result of the following factors:     According to ""India: Priorities for Agriculture and Rural Development"" by World Bank, India's large  agricultural subsidies  are hampering productivity-enhancing investment. Overregulation of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty. Government interventions in labor, land, and credit markets are hurting the market. Infrastructure and services are inadequate. [ 109 ]   Illiteracy, general socio-economic backwardness, slow progress in implementing land reforms and inadequate or inefficient finance and marketing services for farm produce.   The average size of land holdings is very small (less than 20,000 m) and is subject to fragmentation, due to land ceiling acts and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in disguised unemployment and low productivity of labour.   Adoption of modern agricultural practices and use of  technology  is inadequate, hampered by ignorance of such practices, high costs and impracticality in the case of small land holdings.   World Bank says that the allocation of water is inefficient, unsustainable and inequitable. The  irrigation  infrastructure is deteriorating. [ 109 ]  Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only 52.6% of the land was irrigated in 200304, [ 110 ]  which result in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the  Monsoon  season. A good monsoon results in a robust growth for the economy as a whole, while a poor monsoon leads to a sluggish growth. [ 111 ]  Farm credit is regulated by  NABARD , which is the statutory apex agent for rural development in the subcontinent.     India has many farm insurance companies that insure wheat, fruit, rice and rubber farmers in the event of natural disasters or catastrophic crop failure, under the supervision of the  Ministry of Agriculture . One notable company that provides all of these insurance policies is  agriculture insurance company of india  and it alone insures almost 20 million farmers.   India's population is growing faster than its ability to produce rice and wheat. [ 17 ]  The most important structural reform for self-sufficiency is the  ITC Limited  plan to connect 20,000 villages to the Internet by 2013. [ 112 ]  This will provide farmers with up to date crop prices for the first time, which should minimise losses incurred from neighbouring producers selling early and in turn facilitate investment in rural areas.     [ edit ]   Corruption   Main article:  Corruption in India   India ranked 120th on the  Ease of Doing Business Index  2008, behind countries such as  China  (83rd),  Pakistan  (86th), and  Nigeria  (108th).   Corruption  has been one of the pervasive problems affecting India. The economic reforms of 1991 reduced the  red tape , bureaucracy and the  Licence Raj  that had strangled private enterprise and was blamed for the corruption and inefficiencies. Yet, a 2005 study by  Transparency International  (TI) India found that more than half of those surveyed had firsthand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office. [ 113 ]   The  Right to Information Act  (2005) and equivalent acts in the states, that require government officials to furnish information requested by citizens or face punitive action, computerisation of services and various central and state government acts that established vigilance commissions have considerably reduced corruption or at least have opened up avenues to redress grievances. [ 113 ]  The 2007 report by Transparency International ranks India at 72nd place and states that significant improvements were made by India in reducing corruption.

[ 100 ]       The current government has concluded that most spending fails to reach its intended recipients. [ 116 ]   Lant Pritchett  calls India's public sector ""one of the world's top ten biggest problems - of the order of AIDS and climate change"". [ 116 ]   The Economist 's article about Indian civil service (2008) says that Indian central government employs around 3 million people and states another 7 million, including ""vast armies of paper-shuffling peons"" [ 116 ] . Million dollar bureaucracies can be run without a single computer in the management. [ 116 ]   At local level, administration can be worse. It is not unheard of that most state assembly seats are hold by convicted criminals. [ 117 ]  One study found out that 25% of public sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers could not be found at the workplace. India's absence rates are one of the worst in the world. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ]   The Reserve Bank of India has warned that India's public-debt to GDP ratio is over 70 percent. [ 122 ]  The government of India is  highly indebted  and its former investment-grade status has deteriorated near junk status. [ 123 ]     [ edit ]   Education   Main article:  Education in India   India has made huge progress in terms of increasing  primary education  attendance rate and expanding  literacy  to approximately two thirds of the population. [ 124 ]  However, education is still far behind developing countries such as China. Most children never attend secondary schools. [ 124 ]  An optimistic estimate is that only one in five job-seekers in India has ever had any sort of  vocational training . [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Infrastructure   Development of infrastructure was completely in the hands of the public sector and was plagued by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, urban-bias and an inability to scale investment. [ 125 ]  India's low spending on power, construction, transportation, telecommunications and  real estate , at $31 billion or 6% of GDP in 2002 had prevented India from sustaining higher growth rates. This has prompted the government to partially open up infrastructure to the private sector allowing foreign investment [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 100 ]  which has helped in a sustained growth rate of close to 9% for the past six quarters. [ 128 ]   Some 600 million Indians have no mains electricity at all. [ 129 ]  While 80 percent of Indian villages have at least an electricity line, just 44 percent of rural households have access to electricity. [ 130 ]  According to a sample of 97,882 households in 2002, electricity was the main source of lighting for 53% of rural households compared to 36% in 1993. [ 131 ]  Some half of the electricity is stolen, compared with 3% in China. The stolen electricity amounts to 1.5% of GDP. [ 132 ] [ 130 ]  Almost all of the electricity in India is produced by the public sector. Power outages are common. [ 129 ]  Many buy their own power generators to ensure electricity supply. As of 2005 the electricity production was at 661.6 billion kWh with oil production standing at 785,000 bbl/day. In 2007, electricity demand exceeded supply by 15%. [ 129 ]   Multi Commodity Exchange  has tried to get a permit to offer electricity future markets. [ 133 ]   Indian Road Network  is developing. Trucking goods from  Gurgaon  to the port in  Mumbai  can take up to 10 days. [ 134 ]  Taxes and bribes are common between state borders; Transparency International estimates that truckers pay annually $5 billion in bribes. [ 135 ] [ 134 ]  India has  the world's second largest road network . [ 136 ]  Although India has only 1% of the world's vehicles, India has 8 per cent of the world's vehicle fatalities. [ 137 ] [ 138 ]   Container traffic is growing at 15% a year. [ 139 ]  Some 60% of Indias container traffic is handled by the  Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust  in  Mumbai . It has just 9 berths compared to 40 in  Singapore 's main port. It takes an average of 21 days to clear import cargo in India compared to just 3 in Singapore. [ 129 ]  China had 30 times more container traffic in 2004. [ 140 ]   Internet use is rare; there were only 2.1 million broadband lines in India in January 2007. [ 141 ]   Most cities supply water only a few hours a day and none provides 24h water. A World Bank report says it is an institutional problem in water agencies, or ""how the agency is embedded in the relationships between politics and the citizens who are the consumers."" [ 140 ]  Only 13% of sewage is treated according to one estimate, leaving rivers and other water resources under severe strain. [ 129 ]  Some 700 million Indians do not have access to a proper toilet.

Better designed labor regulations can attract more labor- intensive investment and create jobs for Indias unemployed millions and those trapped in poor quality jobs. Given the countrys momentum of growth, the window of opportunity must not be lost for improving the job prospects for the 80 million new entrants who are expected to join the work force over the next decade.     World Bank: India Country Overview 2008 [ 108 ]     India's restrictive labor regulations hamper the large-scale creation of formal industrial jobs. [ 6 ] [ 142 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Internal imbalances   See also:  States of India by size of economy  and  List of regions of India     Lagging states need to bring more jobs to their people by creating an attractive investment destination. Reforming cumbersome regulatory procedures, improving rural connectivity, establishing law and order, creating a stable platform for natural resource investment that balances business interests with social concerns, and providing rural finance are important.     World Bank: India Country Overview 2008 [ 108 ]            A rural woman drying  cow dung  in  Bihar , the poorest state in India.       One of the critical problems facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India's different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development. [ 143 ]  Seven low-income states -  Bihar ,  Chhattisgarh ,  Jharkhand ,  Madhya Pradesh ,  Orissa ,  Rajasthan , and  Uttar Pradesh  - are home to more than half of India's population. [ 144 ]   Between 1999 and 2008, the annualized growth rates for  Gujarat  (8.8%),  Haryana  (8.7%), or  Delhi  (7.4%) were much higher than for  Bihar  (5.1%),  Uttar Pradesh  (4.4%), or  Madhya Pradesh  (3.5%). [ 145 ]   Poverty rates in rural  Orissa  (43%) and rural  Bihar  (40%) are some of the worst in the world. [ 140 ]  On the other hand, rural  Haryana  (5.7%) and rural  Punjab  (2.4%) compare well with middle-income countries. [ 140 ]   The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities [ 146 ]  After liberalization, the more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors. [ 147 ] [ 148 ]     [ edit ]   Environment and health   Main articles:  Environment in India ,  Water supply and sanitation in India , and  Healthcare in India   On Yale and Columbia's  Environmental Performance Index , India's score is 21/100 on sanitation, compared with 67/100 for the region and 48/100 for the country income group. [ 149 ]   About 1.2 billion people in developing nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. [ 150 ]  Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). [ 151 ]  114 cities dump untreated  sewage  and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. [ 152 ]  Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as other developing countries. NewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred  Yamuna River  as ""a putrid ribbon of black sludge"" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem. [ 149 ]   Cholera  epidemics are not unknown. [ 149 ]  Open  defecation  is widespread even in urban areas of India. [ 153 ] [ 154 ]   Indoor air pollution from burning wood, coal and animal dung is widespread. [ 155 ]  70% of rural households in India lack ventilation. Particulate concentrations in houses are reported to range from 8,300 to 15,000 g/m 3 , greatly exceeding the 75 g/m 3  maximum standard for indoor particulate matter in the United States.

Looking back: 2008 Year in Review                               President of the United States                                US History Encyclopedia:    U.S President           Home  >  Library  >  History, Politics & Society  >  US History Encyclopedia          The president of the United States is by far the best known politician both within the United States and around the world. Americans who struggle to recall the name of their representative, senator, or governor almost certainly know the name of the president. Citizens of other countries from Iraq to China, Australia to Russia, are generally familiar with the president's name and photograph and have an opinion on his performance in office. The fame that U.S. presidents enjoy today is appropriate, for the person who holds that office is at the center of both American politics and world affairs. Yet the president is not all-powerful at home or abroad. U.S. presidents are of ten frustrated overseas (for example, in their attempts to bring peace to the Middle East or Northern Ireland), and domestically it is well to remember that, as the political scientist Charles O. Jones has emphasized, the United States does not have a presidential system of government in the sense that presidents are free to make and implement policy. Powers of the Office The Constitution, as is well known, created a system of checks and balances to prevent  tyrannical  government. The political scientist Richard Neustadt correctly noted that the Constitution did not create a system of separated powers favored by theorists such as  Montesquieu , in which legislative, judicial, and executive powers were kept separate from one another. Rather, the Constitution gave pieces of all these powers to all branches of government. The power to  oversee  the departments and agencies of the federal government is given to Congress and the courts as well as to the president; Congress as well as the president is involved in foreign policy through Congress's powers to block the appointment of ambassadors and decide whether to accept or reject treaties, and through its general  power of the purse  through which it decides how much, if at all, to fund policies proposed by the president and his officers. The Constitution is also particularly brief and ambiguous in describing the powers of the president. The president is given the rights to nominate ambassadors and other officers of the United States and to require their opinions in writing, to  veto  legislation (subject to  override  by a two-thirds majority), to report on the state of the union, to negotiate treaties, and to be commander in chief. The Constitution therefore provides a mixture of both precise and ambiguous powers to the president. There was no doubt from the earliest years of the republic that the power to veto legislation provided presidents with an enormously valuable  bargaining  chip in the legislative process. In the case of other Constitutional grants of power, it has taken many years of practice and interpretation to define what they mean. At the time the Constitution was written, the role of the British king as commander in chief had become merely ceremonial and  honorific . Yet by the late twentieth century, U.S. presidents had successfully asserted that this title empowered them to order American forces into battle even if Congress had not used its  undoubted  constitutional right to decide whether or not to declare war. In the Cold War nuclear era, the implications were  sobering . On a less dramatic level, the question of which officers and officials of the United States the president can not only appoint but dismiss is similarly ambiguous in the Constitution. The matter was not fully settled by the Supreme Court until the twentieth century; for example, the president can fire the Attorney General or the Secretary of State, but cannot fire members of independent regulatory commissions or independent counsels. In important respects, therefore, the powers of the president have accumulated over the centuries rather than invariably originating unambiguously from the Constitution. The Constitution gave the president one enormous advantage compared with the other two branches of government, namely the singularity of the office. Power in Congress is widely fragmented between two chambers and among numerous committees, subcommittees, and part leaders. Individual legislators are  hesitant  to grant much of their own power to anyone. The president in contrast enjoys a solitary  splendor . As Alexander Hamilton recognized in the  Federalist Papers,  the president is much better placed to act with speed and dispatch in making decisions than the fragmented Congress. The president's bargaining position with Congress is also enhanced by its divisions and his singularity. Presidents enjoy one important advantage because of a constitutional practice rather than the Constitution as such. The president is uniquely positioned to claim to be the person who can speak for the United States and the national interest, particularly during  crises  and emergencies. This reflects the fact that, contrary to the plan for electing the president set out in the Constitution, the president is in practice elected directly by the people voting state by state. Thus the president can claim with some plausibility to be the only politician to have been elected by all the people, in contrast to legislators elected by a single state or district. Yet all these Constitutional advantages must be set against the constraints the Constitution provides and that we have discussed above. The most obvious are worth reiterating. Presidents cannot legislate without Congress. Presidents cannot even implement established policies unless Congress, which has the power of the  purse , provides the funding. The contrast with a prime minister who can rely on a disciplined parliamentary majority (as is generally the case in Great Britain) is striking. The Presidency in the Political System The Constitution therefore confers both opportunities and constraints upon the president. As we have seen, American presidents share all their powers with other branches of government. Presidents can achieve their policy goals only by winning the support of other political actors. The nature of American politics makes the challenge all the greater. Political parties in the United States are famously (or notoriously) less disciplined than parties in parliamentary systems; the president's unofficial role as leader of his party nationally does not automatically result in legislators from that party supporting one of the president's bills in Congress, particularly if their constituents' interests or opinions conflict with it. Attempts by even the most prestigious presidents to punish members of their own party who have failed to support them (such as Roosevelt in the 1930s) have harmed presidents more than the objects of their wrath. American political parties historically have not coalesced around explicit ideologies to which presidents can appeal for support. It is true that in the late twentieth century the parties in Congress achieved much greater  cohesion  than in the past, with much larger proportions of legislators voting with their party much more of ten than in previous years. Yet, as President Clinton experienced when his proposal for national health insurance failed in a Congress controlled by his own Democratic Party without even a formal vote being taken, higher party unity scores do not necessarily result in support for a particular presidential proposal from his own party. As Richard Neustadt argued, the power of the president is the power to persuade. Fortunately for presidents, they enjoy a number of advantages not enumerated in the Constitution to help them in their attempts to persuade. Particularly in times of acute crisis, such as the beginning of a war, the president's dual role as head of state as well as head of government causes a ""rally effect"" in which the public and other politicians unite in support of the nation's leader. Presidents can reward support with government contracts for the legislator's constituency, appointments for friends, or support for the legislator's own favorite proposal. Most importantly, presidents have the ability to ""go public"" in the words of Samuel Kernell, appealing to the public for support over the heads of other politicians. The rise of the electronic media, first radio and then television, has enabled presidents to establish a direct, almost personal relationship with voters that skilled presidents such as Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton have used to good effect. It is probably advisable for presidents to use this tactic on a limited number of important issues  lest  it lose its impact. If used wisely, it can be decisive. The degree to which presidents are successful in persuading other politicians to follow their lead has varied significantly. Three different cycles can be distinguished. First, success varies over the course of a presidency. Even those presidents regarded as the most successful in gaining support from Congress have found that toward the end of their presidencies their success has faltered. Both Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson experienced dramatic success in obtaining legislation from Congress only to experience subsequent periods of frustration and failure. Second, a president's success may be influenced by reactions to events that occurred under his predecessors. Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter both suffered from the belief that under their predecessors an  overly  powerful ""imperial presidency"" had developed. Ronald Reagan benefited from a fear that under Carter and Ford the presidency had become ""imperiled, not imperial."" Third, there have been longer-term historical variations. The unimposing presidents that  James Bryce  had in mind when he discussed the office in his  magisterial  book,  The American Commonwealth,  gave way to the strong presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and (after  William Howard Taft ) Woodrow Wilson. The uninspiring presidents after Wilson were followed by the strong leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. The Office The Constitution talks of the president, but in the modern era, at least, the presidency is not merely the president but a  sizable  political institution employing over 1,500 people. By way of contrast, the Executive Office contained less than half that number (703) in 1943 when Roosevelt had a world war to run. Some of these people are civil servants, notably in the Office of Management and Budget that constructs the president's budget and monitors the regulations that agencies and departments develop. Around 400 are members of the White House staff, a group of political appointees whose role and power varies from the relatively  mundane  (arranging travel, answering correspondence) to the extremely important (writing speeches, advising on policy issues.) The growth in the size of the Executive Office might be seen as reflecting merely the growth in the responsibilities of governments in all advanced industrialized economies and in the international role of the United States. It is important to note, however, that new functions or responsibilities of American government could have been entrusted to established departments such as State or the Treasury. After all, American presidents are given far more freedom to make political appointments to the top positions in government departments than most democratic heads of government enjoy, and the number of such political appointees continues to grow. Newly elected presidents in the United States can make about 5,000 political appointments; a British prime minister in a country with admittedly only about one-fifth of the U.S. population can make fewer than two hundred. All modern presidents have felt, however, that they needed their own staffers to advise them from within the White House rather than relying on the cabinet secretaries. In part this results from the fact that issues do not correspond to departmental boundaries; a foreign policy crisis will almost certainly involve the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and the Department of Justice as well as the State Department. It also reflects, however, presidents' suspicions about the responsiveness of the civil service in government departments and the commitment of cabinet secretaries to the president's agenda. After all, many political appointments are made more for political reasons (ensuring that there are enough women or minorities in the president's appointments) rather than because those selected are known to have a clear commitment to the president's policy preferences. Indeed, of ten presidents must make appointments to positions in policy fields that they have rarely thought about, and they have no clear preferences until a problem develops. Moreover, political appointees in departments must operate in a political setting in which many influences upon thempowerful congressional committees, the opinions of the permanent  bureaucracy , interest groupscan pull them away from the president's priorities and policy positions. Unlike the leaders of most advanced democracies, American presidents are presented with the challenge of constructing the core executive for themselves. British prime ministers used to walk through the front door of 10 Downing Street to take charge of a prime ministership that was ready to use and with key officials (who are permanent civil servants)in place. U.S. presidents arrive to find that their predecessor has removed all key files and computer discs. A number of obvious dangers lie in wait for the new president in constructing his or her administration. Some presidents (Johnson, Nixon) are said to have created a severely  hierarchical structure  for the White House staff that screened out and sheltered them from bad news or contrary opinions that they needed to hear. Others (Carter for most of his administration, Clinton for periods of his) have been criticized for allowing too much access to them by too many of their staff, resulting in  incoherent  decision making and excessive demands on their time, down to, in Carter's case, allegedly deciding on who could use the White House tennis courts. Reagan claimed that members of his Executive Office, notably Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council staff, had organized the illegal sale of weapons to Iran and transfer of the proceeds to right-wing rebels in Nicaragua. In short, the Executive Office, if organized ineffectively, can harm presidents as well as helping them. An appropriate structure for the White House staff and the Executive Office in general will avoid these dangers. It will also, however, take into account the styles and personalities of the incumbent; an appropriate structure for one president may be  inappropriate  for another. The Presidency and the World Presidents of the United States are elected only by Americans, but their policies and performance matter to people throughout the world. Although the end of the Cold War meant that presidents were no longer as obviously leaders of a mighty ""Western"" coalition, the dominant position of the United States in the world has compelled U.S. presidents to accept a role of global leadership. PostCold War presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush came into office determined to be more domestically oriented than their predecessors but were unable to escape the demands of world leadership. Global issues ranging from climate change to trade, from bringing peace to the Balkans to combating international terrorism against the United States, from countering the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to settling disputes with the European Union over the use of growth  hormones  in beef cattle, have regularly forced themselves onto the agendas of the postCold War presidents. Leaders in other countries are as much a part of the attentive audience for presidents as, for example, representatives in Congress. The annual meeting of the leaders of major advanced industrialized nations known as the G8 brings presidents (and more extensively, their staffs) into regular dialogue with foreign counterparts. Certain foreign leaders (the British prime minister, the Russian president) expect to speak with the U.S. president regularly and informally on major global issues. Almost all foreign heads of government prize the publicity and prestige that a visit to the White House brings. Foreign leaders know that, given the extent of American economic, diplomatic, and military power, a decision not to become involved in a problem that concerns them is as much a policy decision on the part of the American president as a decision to become involved. Presidents frequently find themselves practicing what Robert Putnam termed the ""two level game"" of balancing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes coinciding demands of global politics on the one hand and domestic politics on the other. The Presidency in a New Century The history of the U.S. presidency has been a history of expansion. The institution has grown in terms of the number of people it employs, in terms of the range of policy problems for which presidents are held accountable, and in terms of the international responsibilities of its incumbent. In spite of the misleading  adage  that ""all politics is local,"" Americans feel that through the medium of television they have a closer connection with the president than with any other politician. Yet all the prominence and responsibilities that  befall  a modern president must still be handled within the framework established by an eighteenth-century document, the Constitution, that created not a presidential system of government but a system of separated institutions sharing the powers of government. The president, whose international prominence is so great, must always remember that at home, success depends on the ability to persuade other politicians to cooperate. Bibliography Burke, John P.

In this capacity, the President exercises executive command and control of intelligence agencies, and issues executive orders and presidential directives that shape national security policy. The nation's 14 largest intelligence agencies belong to the Intelligence Community, whose leader, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), reports directly to the President. Executive oversight of intelligence also emanates through the National Security Council (NSC) and the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). The President in turn presents intelligence budgets to the U.S. Congress, which exercises checks and balances on executive power. Architect of National Security The modern age of national security began in 1947, with the passage of the National Security Act, which reorganized the Department of Defense (DOD) and established the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and NSC. Prior to that time, the President had always exercised control over the armed forces as commander in chief, but now he also supervised a  nascent  security and intelligence apparatus destined to grow considerably over the years. The modern President articulates much of his role as director of national security policy through executive orders and, more recently, presidential directives. Executive orders, which originated under the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt and grew considerably in number after World War II, are theoretically subject to congressional  override , but in practice amount to executive edicts. Important executive orders from the 1970s and onward have addressed issues such as the organization of the Intelligence Community and the handling of classified documents. Whereas executive orders are open to the public, presidential directives are classified, and knowledge of their content only emerges, if at all, after the fact. These directives have guided security and intelligence policy since the administration of President John F. Kennedy, and each administration has sought to place its own stamp on them by giving them specific titles as a class. For example, they were known as national security directives under George H. W. Bush, presidential decision directives under William J. Clinton, and national security presidential directives under George W. Bush. In 1986, Congress called on presidents to issue an annual National Security Strategy (NSS), a document outlining the  blueprint  for national security. Prior to the 2002  NSS  of George W. Bush, these usually did little more than simply  restate  policies then in effect. The Bush NSS, on the other hand, outlined an explicit framework for U.S. actions to be taken in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Advisors In directing intelligence policy, the President relies on Cabinet-level advisors whose departments have a role in national security. Most notable among these are the secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, and the Treasury, as well as the Attorney General. Other Cabinet officials, including the secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Transportation, also support some national-security functions, and may be called upon for advice relating to their specific areas. The role of the Vice-President as advisor varies as a function of his relationship with the President. Kennedy, for instance, worked little with Lyndon B. Johnson, whose inclusion on the winning 1960 ticket had resulted from a marriage of convenience designed to attract conservative Southern Democrats. On the other hand, George W. Bush has relied heavily on Vice-President Dick Cheney, who served in the administration of his father. The NSC.  The Vice President is, along with the secretaries of State and Defense, a statutory member of the NSC, as is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the DCI. The chairman of the NSC is the President himself. Intended to serve as the principal advisory board on matters of national security and foreign policy, the NSC has in practice functioned to a level of importance determined by the chief executive. In general, Democratic presidents have tended to take an  ad hoc  approach to the NSC, while Republicans, starting with Dwight D. Eisenhower, have relied more heavily on the NSC, or at least on the National Security Advisor, who played an important role in the administrations of Richard M. Nixon, George W. Bush, and others. The role of the National Security Advisor, officially titled the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, is not mentioned in the National Security Act, and emerged only during the Kennedy administration. In addition to the four statutory members, the two statutory advisors on military and intelligence affairs, and the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of the Treasury is a regular attendee at NSC meetings. The Chief of Staff to the President, Counsel to the President, and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy are invited to attend any NSC meeting, while the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are invited to attend those meetings that pertain to their responsibilities. The directors of other executive departments and agencies, as well as other senior officials, are called to attend when appropriate. Under the George W. Bush administration, the Director (later Secretary) of Homeland Security has been a regular participant in NSC meetings. PFIAB.  Established by  President Eisenhower  in 1956,  PFIAB  is an independent advisory board within the Executive Office of the President. It consists of 16  uncompensated  members, selected by the President from outside the ranks of government. PFIAB reviews the activities and performance of all agencies involved in intelligence activities, and advises the President on its assessments of their performance. It also provides the President with input on the objectives, conduct, and coordination of activities by members of the Intelligence Community. Under the  aegis  of the PFIAB is the three-member Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), established by President Gerald Ford in 1976. The IOB is responsible for  oversight  regarding the legality and  propriety  of intelligence activities, particularlyaccording to its charterthose ""intelligence activities that the  IOB  believes may be  unlawful  or contrary to executive order or presidential directive."" Originally an independent body, the IOB became a standing committee of the PFIAB in 1997. The Intelligence Community, Budgeting, and Congress In addition to leading the CIA, DCI serves as the President's principal advisor on intelligence matters. He also leads the Intelligence Community, which, along with CIA, includes 13 other agencies within the departments of Defense, State, Energy, Justice, the Treasury, and Homeland Security. Among the members of the Intelligence Community are the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, and Defense Intelligence Agency. DCI reports to the President both directly and (depending on the operational structure of the administration in question) through the National Security Advisor. As head of the Intelligence Community, DCI presents the President with the annual Intelligence Community budget, known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP). In preparing the budget for intelligence and national security activities in the coming fiscal year, the President also relies on the Secretary of Defense. The latter presents the President with two budgets: the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) for military intelligence, and Tactical Intelligence and Related Areas (TIARA) for specific tactical intelligence requirements of the military services. Using the  NFIP , JMIP, and TIARA budgets, the President proceeds to establish an overall  DOD  intelligence budget with the help of the National Security Advisor and the  OMB . He then presents these requests to Congress, which, once it approves the request, passes the annual intelligence authorization act. The latter originated in the late 1970s, as a result of congressional  distrust  toward the executive branch in the  fallout  from the  Watergate scandal . Intelligence authorization acts, in addition to numerous mechanisms for direct congressional oversight of intelligence, gives Congress influence over intelligence activities. In the case of the intelligence authorization process, Congress may refuse budgeting for certain requested activities, with the result being a tug-of-war between the White House and Capitol Hill. On the other hand, the President himself may  veto  intelligence authorization acts, which also include other, non-budgetary, provisions. Further Reading Books Andrew, Christopher M.

The head of the executive branch, one of the three branches of the federal government.   The U.S. Constitution sets relatively strict requirements about who may serve as president and for how long. Under Article II, only a natural-born citizen of the United States is eligible to serve as president; a person born outside of the United States, even if he later becomes a citizen, may not serve. In addition, a person must be at least thirty-five years old to become president and must have resided in the United States for at least fourteen years. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, which was added to the Constitution in 1951, no person may serve as president for more than two four-year terms. The amendment further provides that a person who succeeds to the office for more than two years of an unexpired term (for example, because a sitting president dies or resigns) may serve for only one additional four-year term.   Article II also sets the parameters of the president's authority. The article provides that the president is the commander in chief of the armed services. As commander in chief, the president has the power to preserve the peace by governing a captured territory until Congress establishes civil authority over it; she also may declare martial law, which provides for the imposition of military authority over civilians in the event of an invasion, insurrection, disaster, or similar occurrence. In addition, the president can end a  war  through a  treaty  or a presidential proclamation. The power to declare war, however, is vested exclusively in Congress and not the president. In a situation of an undeclared war, under the War Powers Resolution of 1973 (50 U.S.C.A. § 1541 et seq.) the president must consult with Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities. Nevertheless, the practical effect of the statute is somewhat limited because it recognizes the power of the president to unilaterally deploy military forces when necessary.   As the head of the executive branch, the president executes the law but does not legislate, although he submits budgets, and may propose bills, to Congress. The president's legislative power is limited to approving or disapproving bills passed by Congress. If the president approves a measure, it becomes law. If he vetoes the bill, or refuses to approve it, it goes back to either the  House of Representatives  or to the  Senate  (wherever the bill first originated). If both bodies then pass the bill again by a two-thirds margin, the president's  veto  has been overridden and she must sign it into law. Under the line-item veto law, the president may veto only a portion of a bill while leaving the remainder of the legislation intact (2 U.S.C.A. § 691 [1996]).   The president's executive powers also include the authority to issue proclamations and executive orders. A proclamation is a general announcement of policy, whereas an executive order has the force and effect of law by carrying out a provision of the Constitution, a federal statute, or a treaty. For example, during World War II President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order confining Japanese American citizens to camps following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.   The president has the exclusive authority to represent the United States in its relationships with governments of other countries. Through the secretary of state and other officials, the president communicates with other nations, recognizes foreign governments, and makes agreements, including the negotiation of treaties. Treaties, however, must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate before taking effect. Executive agreements with other nations do not require Senate approval but still carry the force of law. For instance, the United States, through the president, has frequently entered into executive agreements to supply economic aid to other nations.   In domestic matters the president is advised by the cabinet, which is comprised of more than a dozen executive departments covering a wide range of areas, including commerce, housing, labor, and the treasury. Each department is headed by a secretary, who is responsible for its overall administration and for reporting to the president.   Should the president be unable to serve a full term, Article II and the  Twenty-fifth Amendment  to the Constitution provide for a line of succession. If the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office through the  impeachment  process, the  vice president  becomes the acting president. This transfer of power also occurs if the president informs both houses of Congress that she is temporarily unable to discharge the duties of president. The House of Representatives can  impeach  a president or indict her for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. If the House votes to impeach, the president is not automatically removed from office; impeachment is instead a formal charge accusing the president of a crime. The articles, or charges, of impeachment are submitted to the Senate, where the president is tried, with the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court presiding over the proceeding. A two-thirds vote in the Senate is needed for a conviction, and the removal of the president from office. The only president to have been impeached was Andrew Johnson, who in 1868 was acquitted by only one vote. In 1974 the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Richard M. Nixon, but he resigned from office before the entire House could vote on the matter.   In May 1997 the Supreme Court ruled that a sitting president does not have presidential  immunity  from suit over conduct unrelated to his official duties. The holding came in a civil suit brought by Paula Corbin Jones against President Bill Clinton. Jones's suit was based on conduct alleged to have occurred while Clinton was governor of Arkansas.

Its neighbors are Namibia in the northwest, Zimbabwe and Botswana in the     north, and Mozambique and Swaziland in the northeast. The kingdom of     Lesotho forms an enclave within the southeast part of South Africa, which     occupies an area nearly three times that of California.        The southernmost point of Africa is Cape Agulhas, located in the     Western Cape Province about 100 mi (161 km) southeast of the Cape of Good     Hope.        Government        Republic.        History        The San people were the first settlers; the Khoikhoi and Bantu-speaking     tribes followed. The Dutch East India Company landed the first European     settlers on the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, launching a colony that by the     end of the 18th century numbered only about 15,000. Known as Boers or     Afrikaners, and speaking a Dutch dialect known as Afrikaans, the settlers     as early as 1795 tried to establish an independent republic.        After occupying the Cape Colony in that year, Britain took permanent     possession in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, bringing in 5,000     settlers. Anglicization of government and the freeing of slaves in 1833     drove about 12,000 Afrikaners to make the “great trek” north     and east into African tribal territory, where they established the     republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.        The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold nine years later brought an     influx of “outlanders” into the republics and spurred Cape     Colony prime minister Cecil Rhodes to plot annexation. Rhodes's scheme of     sparking an “outlander” rebellion, to which an armed party     under Leander Starr Jameson would ride to the rescue, misfired in 1895,     forcing Rhodes to resign. What British expansionists called the     “inevitable” war with the Boers broke out on Oct. 11, 1899.     The defeat of the Boers in 1902 led in 1910 to the Union of South Africa,     composed of four provinces, the two former republics, and the old Cape and     Natal colonies. Louis Botha, a Boer, became the first prime minister.     Organized political activity among Africans started with the establishment     of the African National Congress in 1912.        Jan Christiaan Smuts brought the nation into World War II on the Allied     side against Nationalist opposition, and South Africa became a charter     member of the United Nations in 1945, but he refused to sign the Universal     Declaration of Human Rights. Apartheid—racial     separation—dominated domestic politics as the Nationalists gained     power and imposed greater restrictions on Bantus (black Africans), Asians,     and Coloreds (in South Africa the term meant any nonwhite person). Black     voters were removed from the voter rolls in 1936. Over the next     half-century, the nonwhite population of South Africa was forced out of     designated white areas. The Group Areas Acts of 1950 and 1986 forced about     1.5 million Africans to move from cities to rural townships, where they     lived in abject poverty under repressive laws.        South Africa declared itself a republic in 1961 and severed its ties     with the Commonwealth, which strongly objected to the country's racist     policies. The white supremacist National Party, which had first come to     power in 1948, would continue its rule for the next three decades.        In 1960, 70 black protesters were killed during a peaceful     demonstration in Sharpesville. The African National Congress (ANC), the     principal antiapartheid organization, was banned that year, and in 1964     its leader, Nelson Mandela, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Black     protests against apartheid grew stronger and more violent. In 1976, an     uprising in the black township of Soweto spread to other black townships     and left 600 dead. Beginning in the 1960s, international opposition to     apartheid intensified. The UN imposed sanctions, and many countries     divested their South African holdings.        Apartheid's grip on South Africa began to give way when F. W. de Klerk     replaced P. W. Botha as president in 1989. De Klerk removed the     ban on the ANC and released its leader, Nelson Mandela, after 27 years of     imprisonment. The Inkatha Freedom Party, a black opposition group led by     Mangosuthu Buthelezi, which was seen as collaborating with the apartheid     system, frequently clashed with the ANC during this period.        In 1991, a multiracial forum led by de Klerk and Mandela, the     Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), began working on a new     constitution. In 1993, an interim constitution was passed, which     dismantled apartheid and provided for a multiracial democracy with     majority rule. The peaceful transition of South Africa from one of the     world's most repressive societies into a democracy is one of the 20th     century's most remarkable success stories. Mandela and de Klerk were     jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.        The 1994 election, the country's first multiracial one, resulted in a     massive victory for Mandela and his ANC. The new government included six     ministers from the National Party and three from the Inkatha Freedom     Party. A new national constitution was approved and adopted in May     1996.        In 1997 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chaired by Desmond     Tutu, began hearings regarding human rights violations between 1960 and     1993. The commission promised amnesty to those who confessed their crimes     under the apartheid system. In 1998, F. W. de Klerk, P.W. Botha, and     leaders of the ANC appeared before the commission, and the nation     continued to grapple with its enlightened but often painful and divisive     process of national recovery.        Nelson Mandela, whose term as president cemented his reputation as one     of the world's most farsighted and magnanimous statesmen, retired in 1999.     On June 2, 1999, Thabo Mbeki, the pragmatic deputy president and leader of     the ANC, was elected president in a landslide, having already assumed many     of Mandela's governing responsibilities.        In his first term, Mbeki wrestled with a slumping economy and a     skyrocketing crime rate. South Africa, the country with the highest number     of HIV-positive people in the world (6.5 million in 2005), has been     hampered in fighting the epidemic by its president's highly controversial     views. Mbeki has denied the link between HIV and AIDS and claimed that the     West has exaggerated the epidemic to boost drug profits. The international     community as well as most South African leaders, including Nelson Mandela     and Desmond Tutu, have condemned Mbeki's stance. In 2006, 60 international     scientists called the government's policies “disastrous and     pseudo-scientific.”        As expected, on April 15, 2004, the African National Congress won South     Africa's general election in a landslide, taking about 70% of the vote,     and Thabo Mbeki was sworn in for a second term.        In December 2007, African National Committee delegates chose Jacob Zuma     as their leader, ousting Mbeki, who had been in control of the party for     the last ten years. With the victory, Zuma is poised to become president     when Mbeki's term expires in 2009. Zuma was acquitted of rape charges in     2006. In late December, prosecutors reopened corruption charges against     Zuma and ordered him to face trial for ""various counts of racketeering,     money laundering, corruption, and fraud."" Zuma's lawyers accused Mbeki of     trying to sabotage Zuma's political career. A High Court judge dismissed     the corruption charges against Zuma in September 2008, saying the     government mishandled the prosecution. The judge also criticized President     Mbeki for attempting to influence the prosecution of Zuma.        Under pressure from leaders the African National Congress (ANC), Mbeki     announced he would step down just days after Zuma was cleared. While party     leader's cited Mbeki's alleged interference in the corruption case against     Zuma, Mbeki's resignation culminated several years of bitter infighting     between Zuma and Mbeki, which led to discord in the ANC. On Sep. 25,     Parliament elected Kgalema Motlanthe, a labor leader who was imprisoned     during apartheid, as president. Zuma must be a member of Parliament before     he can be elected president. Parliamentary elections are expected in early     2009.        On his first day as president, Motlanthe acted to move beyond Mbeki's     resistance to using modern and effective methods, such as antirretroviral     medicines, to tackle its AIDS crisis by replacing South Africa's health     minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who has suggested that garlic, lemon     juice, and beetroot could cure AIDS, with Barbara Hogan. ""The era of     denialism is over,"" she said. More than 5.7 million South Africans are     HIV-positive, the highest number of any country in the world.        In November, about 6,400 dissident members of the ANC held a convention     in Johannesburg and decided to form a new party that will challenge the     leadership of the ANC. The delegates, many of whom supported former     president Mbeki, expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership of the     party, calling it corrupt, authoritarian, and ""rotting.""

The EOP was established by the  United States Congress  in 1939 after the  Brownlow Committee  recommended that such a support staff for the President be created.   Since its  inception  under  Franklin D. Roosevelt , the size of the EOP has increased; the current figures for the EOP are about 1,800 full-time equivalent employees. These employees work in the  East Wing  and the  West Wing  of the  White House  and in the  Executive Office Building , an extension of the White House.

Examples include the  White House Press Secretary , the Office of Presidential Communications (including senior media relations personnel and Presidential speechwriters), and White House-based Presidential policy and legal advisors, including those focused on domestic, social, foreign and national security policies of the  federal government of the United States .     [ edit ]   Organization   Senior staff within the Executive Office of the President have the title  Assistant to the President , second-level staff have the title  Deputy Assistant to the President , and third-level staff have the title  Special Assistant to the President .   Very few EOP officials are required to be  confirmed  by the  Senate , although there are a handful of exceptions to this rule (e.g., the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget , and the  United States Trade Representative ). The core White House Staff appointments do not require Senate approval. The staff of the Executive Office to the President is headed by the  White House Chief of Staff .

India    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.    The Republic of India is a large country in South Asia, and one of only two  countries in the world with a population of over one billion. The Indian economy  is the fourth largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity and is  the world's second fastest growing economy. India is also the second most  populous country in the world and the world's largest democracy. It is the  seventh largest country by geographical size. It has grown significantly, in  both population and strategic importance, in the last twenty years. India has  also emerged as an important regional power, possessing one of the world's  largest military forces and a declared nuclear weapons capability.    Located in Asia and constituting most of the Indian subcontinent, India  straddles many trade routes. It shares its borders with Pakistan, the People's  Republic of China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Afghanistan1. Sri  Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia are nearby island nations in the Indian Ocean.  India is home to some of the most ancient civilizations and has given birth to  four major world religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. The country  was a part of the British Empire before gaining independence in 1947.

The Constitution of India and general usage  also recognises Bharat as an official name of equal status. Bharat was the name  of an ancient Indian king. A third name, Hindustan, or land of the Hindus in  Persian, was used from Mughal times onwards.      History  Main articles: History of India, Timeline of Indian history      The Indus Valley Civilisation points to the earliest known urban settlements in  India.Stone Age rock shelters with paintings at Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh are  the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent  settlements appeared 9,000 years ago and developed into the Indus Valley  Civilization, which peaked between 2600 BC and 1900 BC.    Early Hinduism was Brahmanical and based on the Vedas. Later, Buddhism and  Jainism arose in waves of religious reform. Eventually, Hinduism regained its  primacy by interacting with the Vedic and indigenous Dravidian culture. From c.  500 BC onwards, many independent kingdoms came into being. The Maurya dynasty,  which included the Buddhist king Ashoka, made great contributions to India's  cultural landscape, and the Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as  India's Golden Age. Art, mathematics, engineering, astrology, religion, and  philosophy flourished under the patronage of kings. Following the Islamic  invasions in the second millenium, much of India were ruled by the Delhi  Sultanate and later the Mughal dynasty, although some Hindu kingdoms remained in  or rose to power.      A figurine of the Standing Buddha, 5th century, Mathura, Gupta period (4th-6th  century AD).Portuguese, French and English traders took advantage of the  fractured kingdoms to colonise India. The British East India Company became  powerful, and their discriminatory policies caused widespread resentment  resulting in 1857 in an insurrection popularly known as the First War of Indian  Independence. After the revolt India came under the crown of the British Empire.  Subsequently, the Indian independence movement began its struggle for  independence. On August 15, 1947 India was granted independence from British  rule, becoming a secular republic in 1950.    Since its independence, India has fought four wars with its neighbours. In 1974  India became the world's sixth nuclear power, exploding a nuclear device in  Pokhran, Rajasthan. From 1975 to 1977 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a  ""State of Emergency in India"", thereby freezing civil rights and detaining  civilians without trial. The destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992 resulted in  religious strife in much of India. In 1998 the Indian government exploded five  nuclear warheads, confirming India's nuclear status. In 1999 India participated  in the Kargil War in Kashmir to repel Islamic separatists encroaching there.    Government and politics  Main article: Politics of India    India is a democratic republic. It is a federation of states within a federal  structure. The head of state is the President, who has a largely ceremonial  role. The President and Vice-President are elected indirectly by an electoral  college for five-year terms.    The Prime Minister wields the executive power. The Prime Minister is designated  by legislators of the political party or coalition commanding a parliamentary  majority. He or she is assisted by the Council of Ministers, or the cabinet,  appointed by the Prime Minister. All ministers are sworn in by the President.  The President then appoints subordinate ministers on the advice of the Prime  Minister.      Map of India: The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of  India. The northern region of Kashmir is currently administered by India,  Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three  administered regions is not the international boundary but a ceasefire line  demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the  Line of Control, that separating India and China as the 'Line of Actual  Control'.India's bicameral parliament consists of the upper house known as the  Council of States, or Rajya Sabha and the lower house known as the House of the  People, or Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha is chosen by an electoral college whereas  the Lok Sabha is elected directly.    For most of its independent history, India's union government has been ruled by  the Indian National Congress Party. Having been the biggest political group in  pre-independence India, the Congress enjoyed nearly unchallenged dominance in  national politics for over forty years. It was not until 1977 that a united  opposition, under the banner of Janata Party, was able to win elections and form  a non-Congress government.

The rest of northern,  central and eastern India consists of the fertile Indo-Gangetic plain. Towards  western India, bordering southeast Pakistan, lies the Thar Desert. The southern  Indian peninsula is almost entirely composed of the Deccan plateau. The plateau  is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats.    India is home to several major rivers such as the Ganga (Ganges), the  Brahmaputra, the Yamuna, the Godavari, and the Krishna.    The Indian climate varies from a tropical climate in the south to a more  temperate climate in the north. Parts of India which lie in the Himalayan  mountains have a tundra climate. India gets its rains through the monsoons.

However, owing to its huge population,  India's per-capita income by purchasing power parity works out to be US$ 2,540.  India's foreign exchange reserves amount to over US$120 billion. Mumbai serves  as the nation's financial capital and nerve centre; it is home to both the  headquarters of the Reserve Bank of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange. While  many Indians live in poverty, a large middle class has emerged along with the  growth of a promising IT industry.      The IT industry in India is one of India's fastest growing industries pegged at  $13 billion in revenues. Pictured here is Infosys, one of India's leading IT  companies.The Indian economy has shed much of its historical dependence on  agriculture, which now contributes to less than 25% of the GDP. Other important  industries are mining, petroleum, diamond polishing, films, textiles,  information technology services, and handicrafts. Most of India's industrial  regions are centred around the major cities. In recent years, India has emerged  the global leader in software and business process outsourcing services, raking  in revenues of US$ 12.5 billion in the year that ended March 2004. There are  also a lot of small-scale industries that provide steady employment to many of  its citizens in small towns and villages. While India receives only around three  million foreign visitors a year, its tourism base is still an important aspect  of its national income. India's major trading partners are the United States,  Japan, and the European Union.      Demographics  Main article: Demographics of India    India is the second most populous country in the world, with only China having a  larger population. Language, religion, and caste are major determinants of  social and political organisation within the highly diverse Indian population  today. Its biggest metropolitan agglomerations are Mumbai (formerly Bombay),  Delhi, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), and Chennai (formerly Madras).    India's literacy rate is 64.8%, with 53.7% of females being literate. The sex  ratio is 933 females for every 1000 males.    Although 80.5% of the people are Hindus, India is also home to the second  largest population of Muslims in the world (13.4%). Other smaller religious  minorities include Christians (2.33%), Sikhs (1.84%), Buddhists (0.76%), Jains  (0.40%), Jews, Parsis, Ahmadi, and Bah. Religion in India is very public,  with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying  spiritual qualities. A melting pot of many religions, India has rich festivals  celebrated by one and all. The most widely known and popular celebrations  include the Hindu festivals of Diwali, Holi and Dussera.    India is home to two major linguistic families, those of the Indo-Aryan and  Dravidian-derived languages. The Indian constitution recognises 22 languages.  Hindi along with English are the languages used by the Central Government for  Official purposes. Two classical languages native to the land are Sanskrit and  Tamil.    The number of mother tongues in India is as high as 1652.    See also:    List of Indian languages by total speakers   List of cities in India   Religion in India     Culture  Main article: Culture of India      The Taj Mahal in Agra is India's most popular tourist destination.India has a  rich and unique cultural heritage, having striven to preserve its established  traditions throughout history; its dynamic nature is manifest in its willingness  to respect and tolerate foreign ways and practices. Many dynamic cultural  practices and monuments, such as the Taj Mahal, have been inherited from the  rule of Mughal emperors.    Living in a pluralist, multilingual and multicultural society, Indians are  largely tolerant and peaceful. Religious practices of various faiths are an  integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by  members of every socio-economic stratum. The traditional Indian family values  are highly respected and considered sacred. Some urban families have grown into  a nuclear family system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the  traditional joint family system.    Indian music is represented by a wide variety of forms. The two main ones in  terms of classical music are Carnatic from South India and Hindustani from the  north. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being Filmi music;  interestingly, Hindu religious bhajans and Urdu ghazals often transcends the  classical and popular realms. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of  folk music. Many dance forms exist in Indiaharatanatyam, Odissi, Kuchipudi,  Kathak, Kathakali and others. They often have a narrative form (based on the  Indian epics) and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements.      The Gumpa dance is a mystic dance celebrated by the Tibetan Buddhist community  in Sikkim during the Buddhist New Year Losar.The earliest literary traditions  were mostly oral and were later transcribed. Most of these spring from Hindu  tradition and are represented by sacred works like the Vedas and the epics of  the Mahabharatha and Ramayana. Sangam literature from Tamil Nadu represents some  of India's oldest secular traditions. Indian writers in modern times have been  the cynosure of wide acclaim, both in Indian languages and English. India's only  Nobel laureate in literature was the Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore.    India produces the world's highest number of films annually. The most  recognisable face is that of Bollywood, based in Mumbai, which produces mainly  commercial Hindi films. Cinema in other language bases is particularly strong,  with movies regularly produced in well-established Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil and  Telugu industries. India's gift to world cinema was the internationally renowned  Bengali language director Satyajit Ray.    Rice and wheat (in bread forms) are the staple foods in the country. The  gastronomy of India is extremely rich and varied, as spices and other  ingredients vary from region to region. Notable is the country's diverse and  extensive vegetarian cuisine. Indians love their famous spicy food as much as  their wide variety of sweets.    Traditional dress in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and  styles. The Sari and Salwar Kameez are popular styles of dress for women.  Traditional raiments for men are the Kurta and Dhoti.

Football  (soccer) too finds large viewership in almost the entire country. Some  traditional indigenous games are kabaddi and gilli-danda. Chess, carrom, polo,  and badminton are some other games and sports that are said to have originated  in India.    Indian athletes, however, do not shine in the international arena in many  sports. Many blame the Indian government for not having an active sports policy  and allowing for the breakdown of the sporting infrastructure. Others choose to  criticise the perpetual media fixation on cricket as a distraction from other  sports.      Trivia  Traffic moves on the left side (and cars have right-hand drive).

clueweb09-enwp01-57-06997	"                     Powers of the President of the United States          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  Contents       1   Powers of Appointment   2   Executive clemency   3   Foreign affairs   4   Emergency Powers   5   Executive Privilege   6   Constraints on Presidential power   7   See also               [ edit ]   Powers of Appointment   The President of the United States has several different appointment powers.   Before  taking office, the  President-elect  must appoint over 6,000 new federal positions. The appointments range from top officials at U.S. government agencies, to the White House Staff, and members of the United States  diplomatic corps . Many, but not all, of these positions are appointed by the President with the  advice and consent  of the  United States Senate .   The President also has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the  United States Courts of Appeals  and the  United States Supreme Court . However, these nominations do require Senate confirmation, and this can provide a major stumbling block for Presidents who wish to shape their federal judiciary in a particular ideological stance. The President must appoint judges for the  United States District Courts , but he will often defer to  Senatorial courtesy  in making these choices.   As head of the  executive branch , the President must appoint the top officials for all of the federal agencies. These positions are listed in the  Plum Book  which outlines the 7,000 bureaucratic positions that the President has the right to fill. In the case of ten agencies, the President is free to appoint a new agency head at his pleasure. For example, it is not unusual for the  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency  or the NASA Administrator to be changed by the President. Other agencies that deal with federal regulation such as the  Federal Reserve Board  or the  Securities and Exchange Commission  have set terms that will often outlast the time a President sits in office. For example, the members of the Federal Reserve board serve for twelve years. This is to ensure that these agencies can act independently of political control. The President also appoints members to the boards of directors for  Government-owned corporations  such as  Amtrak . The President can also make a  recess appointment  if a position needs to be filled while Congress is not in session.   In the past, Presidents had the power to appoint all members of the United States  civil service . This use of the  spoils system  allowed Presidents to reward political supporters with jobs. Following the assassination of President  James Garfield  by  Charles J. Guiteau , a disgruntled office seeker, Congress instituted a merit-based civil service in which positions are filled on a nonpartisan basis. The  Office of Personnel Management  now oversees the staffing of 2.8 million federal jobs in the federal  bureaucracy .   The President must also appoint his  staff  of 1,800 aides, advisers, and assistants. These individuals are political appointments and are not subject to review by the Senate. All members of the staff serve, ""at the pleasure of the President."" [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Executive clemency     See also:  List of people pardoned or clemenced by a United States president     Article II of the United States Constitution gives the President the power of  clemency . The two most commonly used clemency powers are those of  pardon  and  commutation . A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime. Once a pardon is issued, all punishment for the crime is waived. The person accepting the pardon must, however, acknowledge that the crime did take place. The President maintains the  Office of the Pardon Attorney  in the  United States Department of Justice  to review all requests for pardons. Most pardons are issued as oversight of the judicial branch, especially in cases where  Federal Sentencing Guidelines  are considered too severe for the crime committed. Other pardons have been much more controversial because there have been political motivation for their use. President  Bill Clinton  pardoned millionaire  Marc Rich  after Rich fled the country to escape prosecution. The most famous presidential pardon is that of former President  Richard Nixon  by President  Gerald Ford .   This power can check the legislative and judicial branches by altering punishment for crimes. Presidents can issue blanket  amnesty  which forgives entire groups of people for a crime. President Jimmy Carter offered amnesty to Vietnam War draftees who fled to Canada. Presidents can also issue temporary suspension of prosecution or punishment in the form of  respites . This power is most commonly used to delay federal sentences of execution.   A President can also commute a sentence which, in effect, changes the punishment to time served. While the guilty party may be released from custody or not have to serve out a prison term, all other punishments still apply. President  George W. Bush  commuted the sentence of White House staffer  Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby .     [ edit ]   Foreign affairs   Under the Constitution, the president is the federal official that is primarily responsible for the relations of the United States with foreign nations. The president appoints ambassadors, ministers, and consuls  subject to confirmation by the Senate  and receives foreign ambassadors and other public officials. With the secretary of state, the president manages all official contacts with foreign governments. On occasion, the president may personally participate in summit conferences where chiefs of state meet for direct consultation. Thus, President  Woodrow Wilson  headed the American delegation to the  Paris  conference at the end of World War I; President  Franklin D. Roosevelt  met with  Allied  leaders during  World War II ; and every president since then has sat down with world leaders to discuss economic and political issues and to reach bilateral and multilateral agreements.   Through the  Department of State  and the  Department of Defense , the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the United States. The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiate treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States when approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The president may also negotiate "" executive agreements "" with foreign powers that are not subject to Senate confirmation.     [ edit ]   Emergency Powers   Over the years, Presidents have claimed to have emergency powers in times of crisis. These  Inherent Powers  have been used both at home and overseas. The most common use of emergency powers is to declare a state of emergency which allows the  Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) to bypass normal administrative and jurisdictional rules. Declarations of emergency can also provide special federal aid such as during the  Flood of 1993  along the Mississippi River or in  New Orleans  after  Hurricane Katrina . President Abraham Lincoln used his emergency powers to suspend the writ of  habeas corpus  in Maryland during the  American Civil War . While this was declared unconstitutional by  Chief Justice   Roger Taney  in  ex parte Milligan , Lincoln simply ignored the order. President Harry Truman was also denied emergency powers by the Court in  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer  when he tried to nationalize the nation's steel mills.     [ edit ]   Executive Privilege   Executive privilege  gives the President the ability to withhold information from the public, Congress, and the courts in matters of national security.  George Washington  first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see  Chief Justice   John Jay 's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with  Great Britain . While not enshrined in the Constitution, Washington's action created the precedent for privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress for the  Watergate  hearings, the Supreme Court ruled in  United States v. Nixon  that privilege did not apply in cases where a President was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. Later President Bill Clinton lost in federal court when he tried to assert privilege in the Lewinsky scandal. The Supreme Court affirmed this in  Clinton v. Jones  which denied the use of privilege in cases of civil suits as well.     [ edit ]   Constraints on Presidential power   Because of the vast array of presidential roles and responsibilities, coupled with a conspicuous presence on the national and international scene, political analysts have tended to place great emphasis on the president's powers. Some have even spoken of ""the  imperial presidency ,"" referring to the expanded role of the office that Franklin D. Roosevelt maintained during his term.   President  Theodore Roosevelt  famously called the presidency a ""bully pulpit"" from which to raise issues nationally, for when a president raises an issue, it inevitably becomes subject to public debate. (Although in the argot of his day ""bully"" was simply a  slang  adjective meaning ""nifty"" or ""effective"", today this phrase is frequently taken at face value with the more common sense of the word "" bully "".) A president's power and influence may be limited, but politically the president is certainly the most important power in Washington and, furthermore, is one of the most famous and influential of all Americans.   Though constrained by various other laws passed by Congress, the President's executive branch conducts most foreign policy, and his power to order and direct troops as commander-in-chief is quite significant. (The exact limits of what a President can do with the military without Congressional authorization are open to debate.)   The Separation of Powers devised by the framers of the Constitution was designed to do one primary thing: to prevent the majority from ruling with an iron fist. Based on their experience, the framers shied away from giving any branch of the new government too much power. The separation of powers provides a system of shared power known as Checks and Balances (see  Separation of powers ). For example, the President appoints judges and departmental secretaries. But these appointments must be approved by the Senate.

[ 9 ]  It is bordered by  Pakistan  in the south and east,  Iran  in the south and west,  Turkmenistan ,  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  in the north, and  China  in the far northeast. The name  Afghanistan  means the  Land of  Afghans .   Afghanistan is a crossroads between the  East  and the  West , and has been an ancient focal point of  trade  and  migration . It has an important  geostrategical  location, connecting South and Central Asia and Middle East. During its long history, the land has seen various invaders and conquerors, while on the other hand, local entities invaded the surrounding vast regions to form their own empires.  Ahmad Shah Durrani  created the  Durrani Empire  in 1747, which is considered the beginning of modern Afghanistan. [ 10 ]  Subsequently, the capital was shifted to  Kabul  and most of its territories ceded to former neighboring countries. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a  buffer state  in "" The Great Game "" played between the  British Indian Empire  and  Russian Empire . [ 11 ]  On August 19, 1919, following the  third Anglo-Afghan war , the country regained full independence from the United Kingdom over its  foreign affairs .   Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous and brutal  civil war  in addition to foreign interventions in the form of the 1979  Soviet invasion  and the recent 2001  U.S.-led invasion  that toppled the  Taliban  government. In late 2001 the  United Nations Security Council  authorized the creation of an  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) . This force is composed of  NATO  troops that are involved in assisting the government of President  Hamid Karzai  in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key  infrastructures  in the nation. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion  US dollars  have also been provided by the international community for the  reconstruction  of the country.

Its modern usage derives from the word  Afghan .     Origin of the name   The first part of the name, ""Afghan"", is an alternative name for the  Pashtuns  who are the founders and the largest ethnic group of the country. They probably began using the term  Afghan  as a name for themselves since at least the  Islamic  period and onwards. According to W. K. Frazier Tyler, M. C. Gillet and several other scholars,  ""The word Afghan first appears in history in the  Hudud-al-Alam  in 982 AD.""   Al-Biruni  referred to Afghans as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the  Indus River , which would be the Hindukush Mountains. [ 12 ]   A  Moroccan  traveller,  Ibn Battuta , visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: [ 13 ]       We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of  Persians  called Afghans.       In this regard the  Encyclopdia Iranica  states: [ 14 ]       From a more limited, ethnological point of view, ""Af gh n"" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Pat-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Patn. The equation [of]  Afghan  [and]  Patn  has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Patn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically.       It further explains:       The term ""Af gh n"" has probably designated the Patn since ancient times. Under the form  Avagn , this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer  Varha Mihira  in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his  Brihat-samhita .       This information is supported by traditional  Pashto literature , for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet  Khushal Khan Khattak : [ 15 ]       Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!       The last part of the name,  -stn  is an ancient  Indo-Iranian  suffix for ""place"", prominent in many languages of the region.   The term "" Afghanistan ,"" meaning the "" Land of Afghans ,"" was mentioned by the sixteenth century  Mughal Emperor  Babur in his  memoirs , referring to the territories south of  Kabul  that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called  ""Afghans""  by Babur). [ 16 ]   Until the 19th century the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the  Kingdom of Kabul , as mentioned by the  British  statesman and historian  Mountstuart Elphinstone . [ 17 ]  Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the  Kingdom of Balkh  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [ 18 ]   With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name ""Afghanistan"" to the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties between  British Raj  and  Qajarid Persia , referring to the lands that were subject to the  Pashtun   Barakzai Dynasty  of Kabul. [ 19 ]  ""Afghanistan"" as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in 1857 by  Friedrich Engels . [ 20 ]  It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in 1919, after regaining its full independence over its  foreign affairs  from the British, [ 21 ]  and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 constitution.

Bamiyan  Valley in central Afghanistan, with the Buddha Ruins       Afghanistan is a landlocked and  mountainous  country in South- Central Asia , with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point is  Nowshak , at 7,485 m (24,557 ft) above sea level. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. The  endorheic   Sistan Basin  is one of the driest regions in the world. [ 23 ]  Afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to minor  earthquakes , mainly in the northeast of  Hindu Kush  mountain areas. Some 125 villages were damaged and 4000 people killed by the May 30, 1998 earthquake.   At 249,984 sq mi (647,500 km), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after  Myanmar ).   Tajikistan ,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  border Afghanistan to the north,  Iran  to the west,  Pakistan  to the south and the  People's Republic of China  to the east.   The country's natural resources include  gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  zinc  and  iron ore  in southeastern areas; precious and  semi-precious stones  such as  lapis ,  emerald  and  azure  in the north-east; and potentially significant  petroleum  and  natural gas  reserves in the north. The country also has  uranium ,  coal ,  chromite ,  talc ,  barites ,  sulfur ,  lead , and  salt . [ 1 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  However, these significant mineral and energy resources remain largely untapped due to the effects of the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. Plans are underway to begin extracting them in the near future. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]     History       Main article:  History of Afghanistan       Though the modern state of Afghanistan was founded or created in 1747 by  Ahmad Shah Durrani [ 10 ] , the land has an ancient history and various timelines of different civilizations. Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the area were among the earliest in the world. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Afghanistan is a country at a unique nexus point where numerous  Indo-European  civilizations have interacted and often fought, and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region has been home to various people, among them the  Aryan  ( Indo-Iranian ) tribes, such as the  Kambojas ,  Bactrians ,  Pashtuns , etc. It also has been conquered by a host of people, including the  Median  and  Persian Empires ,  Alexander the Great ,  Turks , and  Mongols . In recent times, invasions from the  British ,  Soviets , and most recently by the  United States and their allies  have taken place. On the other hand, native entities have invaded surrounding regions in  Iranian plateau ,  Central Asia  and  Indian subcontinent  to form empires of their own.          The region that is now Afghanistan was for some of its history part of various Persian dynasties, such as the  Achaemenid dynasty of the Persian Empire  (559330 BCE)       In 2000 BC,  Indo-European -speaking  Aryans  are thought to have been in the region of Afghanistan. It is unlikely [ 31 ]  that the  Aryans  themselves originated in Afghanistan although they did migrate from there south towards India and west towards  Persia , but they also migrated into Europe via north of the Caspian. These Aryans set up a nation which became known as  Airynem Vejah . Original homelands of the  Aryans  have been proposed as Anatolia, Kurdistan, Central Asia, Iran, or Northern India, with the directions of the historical migration varying accordingly. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Later, during the rule of  Ashkanian ,  Sasanian  and after, it was called Ernshahr ( Persian :    -  rnahr ) meaning Dominion of the Aryans.          The  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom  at its maximum extent, circa 180 BCE       It has been speculated that  Zoroastrianism  might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BC, as  Zoroaster  lived and died in  Balkh . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]  Ancient  Eastern Iranian languages , such as  Avestan , may have been spoken in this region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the sixth century BC, the  Persian Empire  of the  Achaemenid  Persians overthrew the  Median Empire  and incorporated Afghanistan (known as  Arachosia  to the Greeks) within its boundaries.  Alexander the Great  conquered Afghanistan after 330 BCE. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the  Seleucid Empire  controlled the area until 305 BCE, when they gave most of the area to the  Mauryan Empire  as part of an alliance treaty. During Mauryan rule,  Buddhism  became the dominant religion in the region. The Mauryans were overthrown by the  Sunga Dynasty  in 185 BCE, leading to the  Hellenistic  reconquest of Afghanistan by the  Greco-Bactrians  by 180 BCE. Much of Afghanistan soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the  Indo-Greek Kingdom . The Indo-Greeks were defeated by the  Indo-Scythians  and expelled from most of Afghanistan by the end of the 2nd century BCE.           Kings with dragons : gold artifacts of the  Scythians  in  Bactria  from the  1st century BC , at the site of  Tillia tepe .       During the first century, the  Parthian Empire  subjugated Afghanistan, but lost it to their  Indo-Parthian  vassals. In the mid to late 1st century AD the vast  Kushan Empire , centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the  Sassanids  in the third century. Although various rulers calling themselves  Kushanshas  (generally known as  Indo-Sassanids ) continued to rule at least parts of the region, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids. [ 36 ]  The late Kushans were followed by the  Kidarite  Huns [ 37 ]  who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful  Hephthalites , as rulers of the region in the first half of the fifth century. [ 38 ]  The Hephthalites were defeated by the Sasanian king  Khosrau I  in AD 557, who re-established Sassanid power in Persia. However, the successors of Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in  Kabulistan  called  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Kabul-Shahan / Shahi , who were later defeated by the Muslim  Arab  armies and finally conquered by Muslim Turkish armies led by the  Ghaznavids .     Islamic and Mongol conquests of the region       Main articles:  Islamic conquest of Afghanistan  and  Mongol invasion of Central Asia       In the  Middle Ages , up to the nineteenth century, Afghanistan was part of a larger region known as  Greater Khorasan . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  Several important centers of Khorsn are thus located in modern Afghanistan, such as  Balkh ,  Herat ,  Ghazni  and  Kabul . It was during this period of time when  Islam  was introduced and spread in the area.   The region of Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including that of the  Samanids  (875999),  Ghaznavids  (9771187),  Seljukids  (10371194),  Ghurids  (11491212),  Mongol Empire ,  Ilkhanate  (12251335), and  Timurids  (13701506). Among them, the periods of the Ghaznavids [ 42 ]  and Timurids [ 43 ]  are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of the region's history.   In 1219 the region was overrun by the  Mongols  under  Genghis Khan , who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the  Ilkhanate  [one of 4 Subordinate Mongolian Khanates], and was extended further following the  invasion  of  Timur Lang  (Tamerlane), a ruler from Central Asia. In 1504,  Babur , a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the  Mughal Empire  with its capital at  Kabul . By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups:  Uzbeks  to the north,  Safavids  to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self-ruled by local tribes.     Hotaki dynasty       Main article:  Hotaki dynasty       In 1709,  Mir Wais Hotak , a local Afghan ( Pashtun ) from the  Ghilzai  clan, overthrew and killed  Gurgin Khan , the Safavid governor of  Kandahar . Mir Wais successfully defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the local population of Kandahar from  Sunni  to the  Shia  sect of  Islam . Mir Wais held the region of Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki . In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an Afghan army to  Isfahan  ( Iran ), sacked the city and proclaimed himself  King of Persia . However, the great majority still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan by the Afghans  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the  Hotaki dynasty  was eventually removed from power by a new ruler,  Nadir Shah  of Persia. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]     Durrani Empire: beginnings of the Afghan state       Main article:  Durrani Empire              Durrani Empire at its greatest extent       In 1738 Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns of the  Abdali  clan [ 46 ] , conquered the region of Kandahar; in the same year he occupied Ghazni, Kabul and  Lahore . On June 19, 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated, possibly planned by his nephew  Ali Qoli . In the same year, one of Nadir's military commanders and personal bodyguard,  Ahmad Shah Abdali , a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a  loya jirga  following Nadir's death. The Afghans gathered at  Kandahar  and chose Ahmad Shah as their King. Since then, he is often regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. [ 1 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  After the inauguration, he changed his title or clans' name to  Durrani , which derives from the Persian word  Durr , meaning  Pearl . [ 46 ]   By 1751 Ahmad Shah Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with  Delhi  in India. [ 20 ]  In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in  Maruf , Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He was succeeded by his son,  Timur Shah Durrani , who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was finally succeeded by his son  Zaman Shah Durrani .     European influence and the creation of the state of Afghanistan       Main article:  European influence in Afghanistan              Political cartoon depicting  Sher Ali Khan  with his friends  Britain  & Russia (1878).       During the nineteenth century, following the  Anglo-Afghan wars  (fought 183942, 187880, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the  Barakzai dynasty , Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the United Kingdom. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King Amanullah Khan acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its foreign affairs (see  The Great Game ). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the  Durand Line . This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India  and later the new state of Pakistan  over what came to be known as the  Pashtunistan  debate. The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was between 1933 and 1973, when the country was under the rule of  King Zahir Shah .     Republic of Afghanistan       Main article:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan       However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law,  Mohammed Daoud Khan , launched a bloodless coup and became the first  President of Afghanistan .   In 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or Kaibar), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA managed to remain at large and organised an uprising.   The PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' means 'April' in Pushto). On May 1, Taraki became  President ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Some are of the opinion that the 1978  Khalq  uprising against the government of Daoud Khan was essentially a resurgence by the  Ghilzai  tribe of the  Pashtun  against the  Durrani  (the tribe of Daoud Khan and the previous monarchy). [ 49 ]   Once in power, the PDPA moved to permit  freedom of religion  and carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide. They also made a number of statements on  womens rights  and introduced women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous May 28, 1978  New Kabul Times  editorial which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country  Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention. [ 50 ]   The majority of people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with religiously conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' restrictions on women's rights and in daily life.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter ) began to covertly fund forces ranged against the pro-Soviet government, although warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention, (according to National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ). [ 51 ]  The  Mujahideen  belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On September 14, Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     Soviet invasion and civil war       Main articles:  Soviet war in Afghanistan  and  Civil war in Afghanistan       In order to bolster the  Parcham  faction, the Soviet Unionciting the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countriesintervened on December 24, 1979. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100,000 plus and by members of the Parcham faction. Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal.   In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and part of its overall  Cold War  strategy, the  United States  responded by arming and otherwise supporting the Afghan  mujahideen , which had taken up arms against the Soviet occupiers. U.S. support began during the  Carter  administration, but increased substantially during the  Reagan administration , in which it became a centerpiece of the so-called  Reagan Doctrine  under which the U.S. provided support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan and also in  Angola ,  Nicaragua , and other nations. In addition to U.S. support, the mujahideen received support from  Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and other nations.   The Soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians. Over five million  Afghans  fled their country to Pakistan, Iran and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       The Soviet withdrawal from the DRA was seen as an ideological victory in the U.S., which had backed the Mujahideen through three U.S. presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich  Persian Gulf .   Following the removal of the Soviet forces, the U.S. and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. [ citation needed ]  The  USSR  continued to support President  Najibullah  (former head of the Afghan secret service,  KHAD ) until 1992 when the new Russian government refused to sell oil products to the Najibullah regime. [ 52 ]   Because of the fighting, a number of elites and intellectuals fled to take refuge abroad. This led to a leadership imbalance in Afghanistan. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, which gave rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. It was at this time that the  Taliban  developed as a politico-religious force, eventually seizing Kabul in 1996 and establishing the  Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . By the end of 2000 the Taliban had captured 95% of the country.   During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. [ 53 ]  Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. [ 54 ]  The majority of the opium production was eradicated by 2001. [ 55 ]     2001present war in Afghanistan       Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001present)              A  U.S. Army  soldier securing a site in  Nuristan Province .              Current President Hamid Karzai at the Arg Presidential Palace       Following the  September 11 attacks  the United States launched  Operation Enduring Freedom , a military campaign to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The U.S. military also threatened to overthrow the Taliban government for refusing to hand over  Osama bin Laden  and several al-Qaida members. The U.S. made a common cause with the former Afghan Mujahideen to achieve its ends, including the  Northern Alliance , a militia still recognized by the  UN  as the Afghan government.   In late 2001, the United States sent teams of CIA Paramilitary Officers from their  Special Activities Division  and U.S. Army Special Forces to invade Afghanistan to aid anti-Taliban militias, backed by U.S. air strikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda targets, culminating in the seizure of Kabul by the Northern Alliance and the overthrow of the Taliban, with many local warlords switching allegiance from the Taliban to the Northern Alliance. [ 56 ]   In December of the same year, leaders of the former Afghan mujahideen and diaspora met in Germany, and agreed on a  plan  for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of  Hamid Karzai , an ethnic Pashtun of the Durrani clan (from which the royal family was drawn) from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the  Afghan Interim Authority .   After a nationwide  Loya Jirga  in 2002, Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim President of Afghanistan. The country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) in 2003 and a new  constitution  was ratified in January 2004. Following an election in October 2004, Hamid Karzai won and became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly  the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973  sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.

As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor  infrastructure , large concentration of  land mines  and other unexploded ordnance, as well as a huge illegal  poppy  cultivation and  opium  trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the  Taliban insurgency  and the threat of attacks from a few remaining al Qaeda.   At the start of 2007 reports of the Taliban's increasing presence in Afghanistan led the U.S. to consider longer tours of duty and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007, U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions. Also, The number of insurgent attacks is up 300 percent since September, 2006, when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters.

With the exception of a  military junta , the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a  monarchy ,  republic ,  theocracy  and  communist state . The constitution ratified by the  2003 Loya jirga  restructured the government as an  Islamic republic  consisting of three branches, ( executive ,  legislature  and  judiciary ).          Politicians of Afghanistan having lunch with the visiting  U.S. President   George W. Bush  in Kabul on March 1, 2006.       Afghanistan is currently led by President  Hamid Karzai , who was elected in October 2004. The current  parliament  was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members, communists,  reformists , and  Islamic fundamentalists . 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3 points more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, long known under the Taliban for its  oppression of women , one of the leading countries in terms of female representation. Construction for a new parliament building began on August 29, 2005.   The  Supreme Court of Afghanistan  is currently led by Chief Justice  Abdul Salam Azimi , a former university professor who had been legal advisor to the president. [ 57 ]  The previous court, appointed during the time of the interim government, had been dominated by fundamentalist religious figures, including Chief Justice  Faisal Ahmad Shinwari . The court issued several rulings, such as banning  cable television , seeking to ban a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and limiting the rights of women, as well as overstepping its constitutional authority by issuing rulings on subjects not yet brought before the court. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more  technocrats  than the previous court, although it has yet to issue any rulings.

Afghanistan currently has more than 70,000  national police  officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 80,000. They are being trained by and through the  Afghanistan Police Program . Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, sometimes local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners. In 2003 the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, now under command of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) was extended and expanded beyond the  Kabul  area. However, in some areas unoccupied by those forces, local militias maintain control. In many areas, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police and/or communications. Troops of the  Afghan National Army  have been sent to quell fighting in some regions lacking police protection. [ 58 ]     Administrative divisions       Main articles:  Provinces of Afghanistan  and  Districts of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is administratively divided into thirty-four (34)  provinces  ( welayats ), and for each province there is a capital. Each province is then divided into many provincial  districts , and each district normally covers a city or several  townships .   The  Governor  of the province is appointed by the  Ministry of Interior , and the  Prefects  for the districts of the province will be appointed by the provincial Governor. The Governor is the representative of the central government of Afghanistan, and is responsible for all administrative and formal issues. The provincial  Chief of Police  is appointed by the Ministry of Interior, who works together with the Governor on law enforcement for all the cities or districts of that province.   There is an exception in the capital city (Kabul) where the  Mayor  is selected by the  President of Afghanistan , and is completely independent from the  prefecture  of the  Kabul Province .

Therefore, relations between Afghanistan and NATO members is strong. Afghanistan depends a lot on multi-billion dollar aid infusions from the United States. Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany are also large donors.   Relations between Afghanistan and the  Islamic Republic of Iran  are very strong. The two nations share the same language and culture, and both countries are part of  Greater Persia . Shiites and Sunnis get a long well in Afghanistan which causes no religious tensions between the two nations. Iran is a consistent donor towards Afghan reconstruction.   Afghan and Pakistani relations always fluctuate. The two nations are always disputing, but recent relations have deteriorated vastly. Afghan Intelligence and American agencies accuse Pakistan of working to stop Afghan reconstruction mainly through the  Inter-Services Intelligence . Most of the Taliban come from Pakistan and Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Pakistan. Afghanistan and Pakistan recently fought a series of border skirmishes and the US has lead several air strikes in Pakistani territory from Afghan air bases.   Afghanistan maintains excellent relations with their Northern Allies, including  Uzbekistan ,  Tajikistan  and  Turkmenistan  as all three share a similar culture as the Afghans.  Hazaras  are from those nations. Afghanistan also has good relations with Russia and India. India is a leading investor in Afghanistan, alongside Iran.   Afghanistan has excellent relations with the rest of the Arab and  Muslim world .     Demographics          Afghanistan is an ethnically diverse country, such as this man in Kabul           Main article:  Demography of Afghanistan       Further information:  Refugees of Afghanistan    A July 2008 estimate of the total Afghan population is 32,738,376. [ 59 ]     Largest cities     See also:  List of cities in Afghanistan  and  Places in Afghanistan     The only city in Afghanistan with over one million residents is its capital, Kabul. The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size,  Kandahar ,  Herat ,  Mazar-e Sharif ,  Jalalabad ,  Ghazni  and  Kunduz .     Ethnic groups           Ethnic groups of Afghanistan   (percentages are from  Encyclopdia Iranica [ 60 ]  and  CIA World Factbook [ 1 ] )         39.4% to 42%  Pashtun         27% to 33.7%  Tajik         8.0% to 9%  Hazara         8.0% to 9%  Uzbek          3.2% to 4%  Aimak         3%  Turkmen         1.6% to 4%  Baloch          4% to 9.2% other ( Pashai ,  Hindki ,  Nuristani ,  Brahui ,  Hindkowans , etc.)       The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are not available. [ 61 ]  Therefore most figures are approximations only.   An approximate distribution of ethnic groups estimated by the CIA World Factbook [ 1 ]  is as following:     Pashtun : 42%   Tajik : 27%   Hazara : 9%   Uzbek : 9%   Aimak : 4%   Turkmen : 3%   Baloch : 2%   Other: 4%     Based on official census numbers from the 1960s to the 1980s, as well as information found in mainly scholarly sources, the  Encyclopdia Iranica [ 60 ]  gives the following list:     36.4% Pashtun   33.7% Tajik,  Farsiwan , and  Qezelbash   8.0% Hazara   8.0% Uzbek   4.1% Aimak   3.3% Turkmen   1.6% Baloch   1.9% other         Languages       Main article:  Languages of Afghanistan             The most common languages spoken in Afghanistan are Persian (Dari dialects) and Pashto. Both are  Indo-European languages  from the  Iranian languages  sub-family. Statistics from the CIA World Factbook are listed in the chart in the sidebar, below the map of languages by region.  Persian  ( Dari dialects ) 50% and  Pashto  35%. Pashto and Persian are the  official languages  of the country.  Hazaragi , spoken by the Hazara minority, is another dialect of Persian. Other languages spoken include  Turkic languages  (primarily  Uzbek  and  Turkmen ) 9%, as well as 30 minor languages 4% (primarily  Balochi ,  Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui ,  Pamiri languages ,  Hindko , etc.).  Bilingualism  is common.   According to the Encyclopdia Iranica, [ 62 ]  the Persian language is the mother tongue of roughly one-third of Afghanistan's population, while it is also the most widely used language of the country, spoken by around 80% of the population. It further states that Pashto is spoken by around 50% of the population.                 Languages of Afghanistan   (percentages are from  CIA World Factbook ) [ 1 ]         50%  Dari (Eastern Persian)         35%  Pashto         8%  Uzbek         3%  Turkmen         4%  Balochi         2% other ( Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui , etc.)                           Culture       Main article:  Culture of Afghanistan              Girls in Kabul, wearing their traditional clothes, sing at a celebration of  International Women's Day  in 2002.       Afghans display pride in their religion, country, ancestry, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their  clan  loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. [ 63 ]  As clan warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.   Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of Buddha in the Bamyan Province were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as  idolatrous . Other famous sites include the cities of  Kandahar , Heart, Ghazni and Balkh. The Minaret of Jam, in the  Hari River  valley, is a  UNESCO World Heritage site . The cloak worn by  Muhammad  is stored inside the famous Khalka Sharifa in Kandahar City.   Buzkashi  is a national sport in Afghanistan. It is similar to  polo  and played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a  goat  carcass.  Afghan hounds  (a type of running  dog ) also originated in Afghanistan.   Although literacy levels are very low, classic  Persian poetry  plays a very important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in  Iran  and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Persian culture has, and continues to, exert a great influence over Afghan culture. Private poetry competition events known as mushaera are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every homeowner owns one or more poetry collections of some sort, even if they are not read often.   The eastern dialects of the Persian language are popularly known as ""Dari"". The name itself derives from ""Prs-e Darbr"", meaning  Persian of the royal courts . The ancient term  Dar   one of the original names of the Persian language  was revived in the Afghan constitution of 1964, and was intended ""to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language. Hence, the name  Frs , the language of  Frs , is strictly avoided."" [ 64 ]          Traditional carpets and a  rubab .       Many of the famous  Persian poets  of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from Khorasan where is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy.     Mawln Rumi , who was born and educated in Balkh in the thirteenth century and moved to  Konya  in modern-day  Turkey   Rabi'a Balkhi  (the first poetess in the History of Persian Poetry, tenth century, native of Balkh)   Daqiqi Balkhi  (tenth century, native of Balkh)   Farrukhi Sistani  (tenth century, the  Ghaznavids  royal poet)   Unsuri Balkhi  (a tenth/eleventh century poet, native of Balkh)   Khwaja Abdullah Ansari  (eleventh century, from Herat)   Nasir Khusraw  (eleventh century, from Qubadyan near Balkh)   Anvari  (twelfth century, lived and died in Balkh)   San' Ghaznawi  (twelfth century, native of Ghazni)   Jm of Hert  (fifteenth century, native of Herat in western Afghanistan), and his nephew Abdullah Hatifi Herawi, a well-known poet   Al Sher Nav'  (fifteenth century, Herat).     Most of these individuals were of Persian ( Tjk ) ethnicity who still form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-known in Persian-speaking world, include  Khalilullah Khalili , [ 65 ]  Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari, [ 66 ]  Sarwar Joya,  Parwin Pazwak  and others. In 2003, Khaled Hosseini published The  Kite Runner  which though fiction, captured much of the history, politics and culture experienced in Afghanistan from the 1930s to present day.          The Friday Mosque in Herat is the religious and cultural center for Western Afghanistan       In addition to poets and authors, numerous  Persian scientists  were born or worked in the region of present-day Afghanistan. Most notable was  Avicenna  (Abu Al Hussein ibn Sn) whose father hailed from Balkh. Ibn Sn, who travelled to  Isfahan  later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as ""the father of modern medicine"". George Sarton called ibn Sn ""the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times."" His most famous works are  The Book of Healing  and  The Canon of Medicine , also known as the Qanun. Ibn Sn's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through  Noah Gordon 's  The Physician , now published in many languages. Moreover, according to  Ibn al-Nadim ,  Al-Farabi , a well-known philosopher and scientist, was from the Faryab Province of Afghanistan.   Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the  Nauroz -celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the twentieth century has been likened to  Vienna  during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.    The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is potent in political terms. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, they would assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders (Khans). In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call ( Ulul-Amr ).   Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. [ 63 ]     Religions           Blue Mosque in Mazari Sharif .           Main article:  Religion in Afghanistan       Religiously, Afghans are over 99%  Muslims : approximately 74-80%  Sunni  and 19-25%  Shi'a [ 1 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ]  (estimates vary). Up until the mid-1980s, there were about 30,000 to 150,000  Hindus  and  Sikhs  living in different cities, mostly in  Jalalabad ,  Kabul , and  Kandahar . [ 69 ] [ 70 ]   There was a small  Jewish  community in Afghanistan ( see  Bukharan Jews ) who fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual,  Zablon Simintov , remains today. [ 71 ]     Economy          Orchards in Eastern Afghanistan           Main article:  Economy of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is a member of the  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ,  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  and the  Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) . It is an impoverished country, one of the world's poorest and least developed. Two-thirds of the population lives on fewer than 2  US  dollars a day. Its economy has suffered greatly from the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 19982001. [ 72 ] [ 73 ]   The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). As of 2005, the official unemployment rate is at 40%. [ 74 ]  The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. [ 75 ]   The nation's economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion  US dollars  in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats. [ 76 ]  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.          Irrigated farm fields.       The real value of  non-drug  GDP increased by 29% in 2002, 16% in 2003, 8% in 2004 and 14% in 2005. [ 77 ]  As much as one-third of Afghanistan's  GDP  comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including  opium  and its two derivatives,  morphine  and  heroin , as well as  hashish  production. [ 1 ]   Opium production in Afghanistan  has soared to a new record in 2007, with an increase on last year of more than a third, the United Nations has said. [ 78 ]  Some 3.3 million Afghans are now involved in producing opium. [ 79 ]  In a recent article in the  Washington Quarterly , Peter van Ham and Jorrit Kamminga argue that the international community should establish a pilot project and investigate a licensing scheme to start the production of medicines such as morphine and codeine from poppy crops to help it escape the economic dependence on opium: [ 80 ]   According to a 2004 report by the  Asian Development Bank , the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development. [ 75 ]  In 2006, two U.S. companies, Black & Veatch and the  Louis Berger Group , have won a US 1.4 billion dollar contract to rebuild roads, power lines and water supply systems of Afghanistan. [ 81 ]   One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 4 million refugees from neighbouring countries and the  West , who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. What is also helping is the estimated US 23 billion dollars in international assistance every year, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. Private developments are also beginning to get underway. In 2006, a Dubai-based Afghan family opened a $25 million  Coca Cola  bottling plant in Afghanistan. [ 82 ]   While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion  about 15%  is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the  United Nations  system and  non-governmental organizations . The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through  customs , as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.   Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the Afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old Afghani by 1 new Afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003. [ 75 ]   The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels. Since 2003, over sixteen new banks have opened in the country, including  Afghanistan International Bank ,  Kabul Bank ,  Azizi Bank ,  Standard Chartered Bank ,  First Micro Finance Bank , and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year  tax holidays  to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports  tariffs  and duties.          The plan for Kabul's nine billion dollar future modern urban development project, the  City of Light Development .       Some private investment projects, backed with national support, are also beginning to pick up steam in Afghanistan. An initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr.  Hisham N. Ashkouri , Principal of  ARCADD, Inc.  for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue, [ 83 ]  revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the  Afghan National Museum .   According to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to 36 trillion cubic feet (1,000 km 3 ) of  natural gas , 3.6 billion barrels (570,000,000 m 3 ) of  petroleum  and up to 1,325 million barrels (2.107E+8 m 3 ) of  natural gas liquids . This could mark the turning point in Afghanistans reconstruction efforts. Energy exports could generate the revenue that Afghan officials need to modernize the countrys infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for the beleaguered and fractious population. [ 27 ]  Other reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal,  iron ore  and other  minerals . [ 24 ] [ 28 ] [ 84 ]  The government of Afghanistan is in the process of extracting and exporting its copper reserves, which will be earning $1.2 billion US dollars in  royalties  and taxes every year for the next 30 years. It will also provide permanent labor to 3,000 of its citizens.

International flights include to  Dubai ,  Frankfurt ,  Istanbul  and a number of other destinations. [ citation needed ]  There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from  Kam Air ,  Pamir Airways  and  Safi Airlines .   The country has limited rail service with Turkmenistan. There are two  railway  projects currently in progress, one is between Herat and the Iranian city  Mashad  while another is between Kandahar and  Quetta  in Pakistan. Most people who travel from one city to another use bus services. Automobiles have recently become more widely available, with  Toyota ,  Nissan  and  Hyundai  dealerships in Kabul. A large number of second-hand vehicles are also arriving from the  UAE . Nearly all highways and roads are being rebuilt in the country.     Communications and technology       Main article:  Communications in Afghanistan       Telecommunication services in the country are provided by  Afghan Wireless ,  Etisalat ,  Roshan ,  Areeba  and  Afghan Telecom . In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a  US$ 64.5 million agreement with  ZTE Corporation  for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country. [ 87 ]   Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.   The nation's post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as  FedEx ,  DHL  and others are also available.     Education       Main article:  Education in Afghanistan              Female school students.              Military 90 day training course provided by the United States to train elite commandos for the  Afghan National Army  in Kabul       As of 2006 more than four million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout the country. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. A lack of women teachers is an issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men. [ 88 ]   Literacy of the entire population is estimated (as of 1999) at 36%, the male literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. Up to now there are 9,500 schools in the country.   Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of  higher education . Following the fall of the Taliban,  Kabul University  was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the  American University of Afghanistan  also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The university accepts students from Afghanistan and the neighboring countries. Construction work will soon start at the new site selected for  University of Balkh  in Mazari Sharif. The new building for the university, including the building for the Engineering Department, would be constructed at  600 acres (2.4 km)  of land at the cost of 250 million US dollars. [ 89 ]   A new military school is in function to properly train and educate Afghan soldiers.

Sign Up Discuss  in my Forum   The President of the United States The Nation's Chief Executive From  Phaedra Trethan , for About.com    See More About: president of the united states president's cabinet presidential veto protecting the president presidential salary               The primary duty of the president of the United States is to make sure that all U.S. laws are carried out and that the federal government is run effectively. Although the president may not introduce new legislation - that's the duty of Congress - he does wield veto power over all bills that are approved by the legislature. In addition, the president has the weighty role of commander in chief of the armed forces.  As the nation's chief executive, the president oversees foreign policy, making treaties with foreign nations and appointing ambassadors to other nations and to the United Nations. He also appoints members of the  Cabinet , as well as  Supreme Court  justices and federal judges. Day-To-Day Governance  The president, with Senate approval, appoints a  Cabinet , which oversees specific facets of government.  Members of the Cabinet  include - but are not limited to - the vice president, the presidential chief of staff, the U.S trade representative, and the heads of all the major federal departments, such as the secretaries of  state ,  defense , the  Treasury  and the attorney general, who leads the  Justice Department . The president, along with his Cabinet, helps set the tone and policy for the entire  executive branch  and how the laws of the United States are enforced. Legislative Duties  The president is expected to address the full Congress at least once a year to report on the  State of the Union . Although the president does not have the power to enact laws, he does work with Congress to introduce new legislation and carries a great deal of power, particularly with members of his own party, to lobby for legislation he favors. If Congress should enact a law that the president opposes, he may veto the legislation before it can become law. Congress may override the  presidential veto  with a two-thirds majority of those in attendance in both the Senate and House of Representatives at the time the override vote is taken. Foreign Policy  The president is authorized to make treaties with foreign nations, pending Senate approval. He also appoints ambassadors to other countries and to the United Nations, though those, too, require Senate confirmation. The president and his administration represent the interests of the United States abroad; as such, he often meets with, entertains and develops a relationship with other heads of state.   Commander in Chief  The president serves as commander in chief of the nation's armed forces. In addition to his powers over the military, the president has the authority to deploy those forces at his discretion, with congressional approval. He may also ask Congress to declare war on other nations.   Salary and Perks  Being president is not without its perks. The president earns $400,000 per year and is, traditionally, the highest-paid federal official. He has use of two presidential residences, the White House and Camp David in Maryland; has both an airplane, Air Force One, and helicopter, Marine One, at his disposal; and has a legion of staff members including a personal chef to assist him in both his professional duties and private life.   Risky Job  The job is certainly  not without its risks . The president and his family are given round-the-clock  protection by the Secret Service . Abraham Lincoln was the first U.S. president to be assassinated; James Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy were also assassinated while in office. Andrew Jackson, Harry Truman, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan all survived assassination attempts. Presidents continue to receive Secret Service protection after they retire from office.

It is variously designated as geographically located within  Central Asia , [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   South Asia , [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  and the  Middle East . [ 9 ]  It is bordered by  Pakistan  in the south and east,  Iran  in the south and west,  Turkmenistan ,  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  in the north, and  China  in the far northeast. The name  Afghanistan  means the  Land of  Afghans .   Afghanistan is a crossroads between the  East  and the  West , and has been an ancient focal point of  trade  and  migration . It has an important  geostrategical  location, connecting South and Central Asia and Middle East. During its long history, the land has seen various invaders and conquerors, while on the other hand, local entities invaded the surrounding vast regions to form their own empires.  Ahmad Shah Durrani  created the  Durrani Empire  in 1747, which is considered the beginning of modern Afghanistan. [ 10 ]  Subsequently, the capital was shifted to  Kabul  and most of its territories ceded to former neighboring countries. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a  buffer state  in "" The Great Game "" played between the  British Indian Empire  and  Russian Empire . [ 11 ]  On August 19, 1919, following the  third Anglo-Afghan war , the country regained full independence from the United Kingdom over its  foreign affairs .   Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous and brutal  civil war  in addition to foreign interventions in the form of the 1979  Soviet invasion  and the recent 2001  U.S.-led invasion  that toppled the  Taliban  government. In late 2001 the  United Nations Security Council  authorized the creation of an  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) . This force is composed of  NATO  troops that are involved in assisting the government of President  Hamid Karzai  in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key  infrastructures  in the nation. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion  US dollars  have also been provided by the international community for the  reconstruction  of the country.

Its modern usage derives from the word  Afghan .     Origin of the name   The first part of the name, ""Afghan"", is an alternative name for the  Pashtuns  who are the founders and the largest ethnic group of the country. They probably began using the term  Afghan  as a name for themselves since at least the  Islamic  period and onwards. According to W. K. Frazier Tyler, M. C. Gillet and several other scholars,  ""The word Afghan first appears in history in the  udd al-lam  in 982 AD.""   Al-Biruni  referred to Afghans as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the  Indus River , which would be the  Sulaiman Mountains . [ 12 ]   A  Moroccan  traveller,  Ibn Battuta , visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: [ 13 ]       We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of  Persians  called Afghans.       In this regard the  Encyclopdia Iranica  states: [ 14 ]       From a more limited, ethnological point of view, ""Af gh n"" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Pat-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Patn. The equation [of]  Afghan  [and]  Patn  has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Patn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically.       It further explains:       The term ""Af gh n"" has probably designated the Patn since ancient times. Under the form  Avagn , this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer  Varha Mihira  in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his  Brihat-samhita .       This information is supported by traditional  Pashto literature , for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet  Khushal Khan Khattak : [ 15 ]       Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!       The last part of the name,  -stn  is an ancient  Indo-Iranian  suffix for ""place"", prominent in many languages of the region.   The term "" Afghanistan ,"" meaning the "" Land of Afghans ,"" was mentioned by the sixteenth century  Mughal Emperor  Babur in his  memoirs , referring to the territories south of  Kabul  that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called  ""Afghans""  by Babur). [ 16 ]   Until the 19th century the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the  Kingdom of Kabul , as mentioned by the  British  statesman and historian  Mountstuart Elphinstone . [ 17 ]  Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the  Kingdom of Balkh  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [ 18 ]   With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name ""Afghanistan"" to the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties between the  British Raj  and  Qajarid Persia , referring to the lands subject to the  Pashtun   Barakzai Dynasty  of Kabul. [ 19 ]  ""Afghanistan"" as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in 1857 by  Friedrich Engels . [ 20 ]  It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in 1919, after regaining full independence over its  foreign affairs  from the British, [ 21 ]  and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 constitution. [ 22 ]     Geography       Main article:  Geography of Afghanistan              Topography       Afghanistan is a landlocked and  mountainous  country in South- Central Asia , with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point is  Nowshak , at 7,485 m (24,557 ft) above sea level. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. The  endorheic   Sistan Basin  is one of the driest regions in the world. [ 23 ]  Afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to minor  earthquakes , mainly in the northeast of  Hindu Kush  mountain areas. Some 125 villages were damaged and 4000 people killed by the May 30, 1998 earthquake.   At 249,984 sq mi (647,500 km), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after  Myanmar ).   Tajikistan ,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  border Afghanistan to the north,  Iran  to the west,  Pakistan  to the south and the  People's Republic of China  to the east.   The country's natural resources include  gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  zinc  and  iron ore  in southeastern areas; precious and  semi-precious stones  such as  lapis ,  emerald  and  azure  in the north-east; and potentially significant  petroleum  and  natural gas  reserves in the north. The country also has  uranium ,  coal ,  chromite ,  talc ,  barites ,  sulfur ,  lead , and  salt . [ 1 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  However, these significant mineral and energy resources remain largely untapped due to the effects of the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. Plans are underway to begin extracting them in the near future. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]     History       Main article:  History of Afghanistan              The region that is now Afghanistan was for some of its history part of various Persian dynasties, such as the  Achaemenid dynasty of the Persian Empire  (559330 BCE)       Though the modern state of Afghanistan was founded or created in 1747 by  Ahmad Shah Durrani [ 10 ] , the land has an ancient history and various timelines of different civilizations. Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the area were among the earliest in the world. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Afghanistan is a country at a unique nexus point where numerous  Indo-European  civilizations have interacted and often fought, and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region has been home to various people, among them the  Aryan  ( Indo-Iranian ) tribes, such as the  Kambojas ,  Bactrians ,  Pashtuns , etc. It also has been conquered by a host of people, including the  Median  and  Persian Empires ,  Alexander the Great ,  Turks , and  Mongols . In recent times, invasions from the  British ,  Soviets , and most recently by the  United States and their allies  have taken place. On the other hand, native entities have invaded surrounding regions in  Iranian plateau ,  Central Asia  and  Indian subcontinent  to form empires of their own.   In 2000 BC,  Indo-European -speaking  Aryans  are thought to have been in the region of Afghanistan. It is unlikely [ 31 ]  that the  Aryans  themselves originated in Afghanistan although they did migrate from there south towards India and west towards  Persia , but they also migrated into Europe via north of the Caspian. These Aryans set up a nation which became known as  Airynem Vejah . Original homelands of the  Aryans  have been proposed as Anatolia, Kurdistan, Central Asia, Iran, or Northern India, with the directions of the historical migration varying accordingly. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Later, during the rule of  Ashkanian ,  Sasanian  and after, it was called Ernshahr ( Persian :    -  rnahr ) meaning Dominion of the Aryans.   It has been speculated that  Zoroastrianism  might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BC, as  Zoroaster  lived and died in  Balkh . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]  Ancient  Eastern Iranian languages , such as  Avestan , may have been spoken in this region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the sixth century BC, the  Persian Empire  of the  Achaemenid  Persians overthrew the  Median Empire  and incorporated Afghanistan (known as  Arachosia  to the Greeks) within its boundaries.  Alexander the Great  conquered Afghanistan after 330 BCE. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the  Seleucid Empire  controlled the area until 305 BCE, when they gave most of the area to the  Mauryan Empire  as part of an alliance treaty. During Mauryan rule,  Buddhism  became the dominant religion in the region. The Mauryans were overthrown by the  Sunga Dynasty  in 185 BCE, leading to the  Hellenistic  reconquest of Afghanistan by the  Greco-Bactrians  by 180 BCE. Much of Afghanistan soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the  Indo-Greek Kingdom . The Indo-Greeks were defeated by the  Indo-Scythians  and expelled from most of Afghanistan by the end of the 2nd century BCE.          The  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom  at its maximum extent, circa 180 BCE       During the first century, the  Parthian Empire  subjugated Afghanistan, but lost it to their  Indo-Parthian  vassals. In the mid to late 1st century AD the vast  Kushan Empire , centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the  Sassanids  in the third century. Although various rulers calling themselves  Kushanshas  (generally known as  Indo-Sassanids ) continued to rule at least parts of the region, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids. [ 36 ]  The late Kushans were followed by the  Kidarite  Huns [ 37 ]  who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful  Hephthalites , as rulers of the region in the first half of the fifth century. [ 38 ]  The Hephthalites were defeated by the Sasanian king  Khosrau I  in AD 557, who re-established Sassanid power in Persia. However, the successors of Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in  Kabulistan  called  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Kabul-Shahan / Shahi , who were later defeated by the Muslim  Arab  armies and finally conquered by Muslim Turkish armies led by the  Ghaznavids .     Islamic and Mongol conquests of the region       Main articles:  Islamic conquest of Afghanistan  and  Mongol invasion of Central Asia       In the  Middle Ages , up to the nineteenth century, Afghanistan was part of a larger region known as  Greater Khorasan . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  Several important centers of Khorsn are thus located in modern Afghanistan, such as  Balkh ,  Herat ,  Ghazni  and  Kabul . It was during this period of time when  Islam  was introduced and spread in the area.   The region of Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including that of the  Samanids  (875999),  Ghaznavids  (9771187),  Seljukids  (10371194),  Ghurids  (11491212),  Mongol Empire ,  Ilkhanate  (12251335), and  Timurids  (13701506). Among them, the periods of the Ghaznavids [ 42 ]  and Timurids [ 43 ]  are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of the region's history.   In 1219 the region was overrun by the  Mongols  under  Genghis Khan , who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the  Ilkhanate  [one of 4 Subordinate Mongolian Khanates], and was extended further following the  invasion  of  Timur Lang  (Tamerlane), a ruler from Central Asia. In 1504,  Babur , a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the  Mughal Empire  with its capital at  Kabul . By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups:  Uzbeks  to the north,  Safavids  to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self-ruled by local tribes.     Hotaki dynasty       Main article:  Hotaki dynasty       In 1709,  Mir Wais Hotak , a local Afghan ( Pashtun ) from the  Ghilzai  clan, overthrew and killed  Gurgin Khan , the Safavid governor of  Kandahar . Mir Wais successfully defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the local population of Kandahar from  Sunni  to the  Shia  sect of  Islam . Mir Wais held the region of Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki . In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an Afghan army to  Isfahan  ( Iran ), sacked the city and proclaimed himself  King of Persia . However, the great majority still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan by the Afghans  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the  Hotaki dynasty  was eventually removed from power by a new ruler,  Nadir Shah  of Persia. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]          Durrani Empire at its greatest extent         Durrani Empire: beginnings of the Afghan state       Main article:  Durrani Empire       In 1738 Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns of the  Abdali  clan [ 46 ] , conquered the region of Kandahar; in the same year he occupied Ghazni, Kabul and  Lahore . On June 19, 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated, possibly planned by his nephew  Ali Qoli . In the same year, one of Nadir's military commanders and personal bodyguard,  Ahmad Shah Abdali , a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a  loya jirga  following Nadir's death. The Afghans gathered at  Kandahar  and chose Ahmad Shah as their King. Since then, he is often regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. [ 1 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  After the inauguration, he changed his title or clans' name to  Durrani , which derives from the Persian word  Durr , meaning  Pearl . [ 46 ]   By 1751 Ahmad Shah Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with  Delhi  in India. [ 20 ]  In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in  Maruf , Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He was succeeded by his son,  Timur Shah Durrani , who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was finally succeeded by his son  Zaman Shah Durrani .     European influence and the creation of the state of Afghanistan       Main article:  European influence in Afghanistan              King Amanullah on a royal trip to Berlin. This trip initiated a great alliance between Afghanistan and Germany that continues to this day.       During the nineteenth century, following the  Anglo-Afghan wars  (fought 183942, 187880, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the  Barakzai dynasty , Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the United Kingdom. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King Amanullah Khan acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its foreign affairs (see  The Great Game ). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the  Durand Line . This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India  and later the new state of Pakistan  over what came to be known as the  Pashtunistan  debate. The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was between 1933 and 1973, when the country was under the rule of  King Zahir Shah .     Republic of Afghanistan       Main article:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan       However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law,  Mohammed Daoud Khan , launched a bloodless coup and became the first  President of Afghanistan .   In 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or Kaibar), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA managed to remain at large and organised an uprising.   The PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' means 'April' in Pushto). On May 1, Taraki became  President ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Some are of the opinion that the 1978  Khalq  uprising against the government of Daoud Khan was essentially a resurgence by the  Ghilzai  tribe of the  Pashtun  against the  Durrani  (the tribe of Daoud Khan and the previous monarchy). [ 49 ]   Once in power, the PDPA moved to permit  freedom of religion  and carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide. They also made a number of statements on  womens rights  and introduced women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous May 28, 1978  New Kabul Times  editorial which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country  Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention. [ 50 ]          Afghan village destroyed by communist forces recaptured by resistance fighters. The Afghan Resistance defeated the great Soviet superpower 10 years after the initial invasion.       The majority of people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with religiously conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' restrictions on women's rights and in daily life.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter ) began to covertly fund forces ranged against the pro-Soviet government, although warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention, (according to National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ). [ 51 ]  The  Mujahideen  belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On September 14, Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     Soviet invasion and civil war       Main articles:  Soviet war in Afghanistan  and  Civil war in Afghanistan       In order to bolster the  Parcham  faction, the Soviet Unionciting the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countriesintervened on December 24, 1979. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100,000 plus and by members of the Parcham faction. Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and part of its overall  Cold War  strategy, the  United States  responded by arming and otherwise supporting the Afghan  mujahideen , which had taken up arms against the Soviet occupiers. U.S. support began during the  Carter  administration, but increased substantially during the  Reagan administration , in which it became a centerpiece of the so-called  Reagan Doctrine  under which the U.S. provided support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan and also in  Angola ,  Nicaragua , and other nations. In addition to U.S. support, the mujahideen received support from  Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and other nations.   The Soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians. Over five million  Afghans  fled their country to Pakistan, Iran and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989.    The Soviet withdrawal from the DRA was seen as an ideological victory in the U.S., which had backed the Mujahideen through three U.S. presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich  Persian Gulf .   Following the removal of the Soviet forces, the U.S. and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. [ citation needed ]  The  USSR  continued to support President  Najibullah  (former head of the Afghan secret service,  KHAD ) until 1992 when the new Russian government refused to sell oil products to the Najibullah regime. [ 52 ]   Because of the fighting, a number of elites and intellectuals fled to take refuge abroad. This led to a leadership imbalance in Afghanistan. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, which gave rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. It was at this time that the  Taliban  developed as a politico-religious force, eventually seizing Kabul in 1996 and establishing the  Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . By the end of 2000 the Taliban had captured 95% of the country.   During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. [ 53 ]  Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. [ 54 ]  The majority of the opium production was eradicated by 2001.

An Afghan Air Force soldier aboard an Afghan gunship.       Following the  September 11 attacks  the United States launched  Operation Enduring Freedom , a military campaign to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The U.S. military also threatened to overthrow the Taliban government for refusing to hand over  Osama bin Laden  and several al-Qaida members. The U.S. made a common cause with the former Afghan Mujahideen to achieve its ends, including the  Northern Alliance , a militia still recognized by the  UN  as the Afghan government.   In late 2001, the United States sent teams of CIA Paramilitary Officers from their  Special Activities Division  and U.S. Army Special Forces to invade Afghanistan to aid anti-Taliban militias, backed by U.S. air strikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda targets, culminating in the seizure of Kabul by the Northern Alliance and the overthrow of the Taliban, with many local warlords switching allegiance from the Taliban to the Northern Alliance. [ 56 ]   In December of the same year, leaders of the former Afghan mujahideen and diaspora met in Germany, and agreed on a  plan  for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of  Hamid Karzai , an ethnic Pashtun of the Durrani clan (from which the royal family was drawn) from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the  Afghan Interim Authority .   After a nationwide  Loya Jirga  in 2002, Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim President of Afghanistan. The country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) in 2003 and a new  constitution  was ratified in January 2004. Following an election in October 2004, Hamid Karzai won and became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly  the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973  sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.   As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor  infrastructure , large concentration of  land mines  and other unexploded ordnance, as well as a huge illegal  poppy  cultivation and  opium  trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the  Taliban insurgency  and the threat of attacks from a few remaining al Qaeda.   At the start of 2007 reports of the Taliban's increasing presence in Afghanistan led the U.S. to consider longer tours of duty and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007, U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions. Also, The number of insurgent attacks is up 300 percent since September, 2006, when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters.     See also:  Timeline of the history of Afghanistan  and  Invasions of Afghanistan       Government and politics       Main article:  Politics of Afghanistan       Politics in Afghanistan has historically consisted of power struggles, bloody  coups  and unstable transfers of power. With the exception of a  military junta , the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a  monarchy ,  republic ,  theocracy  and  communist state . The constitution ratified by the  2003 Loya jirga  restructured the government as an  Islamic republic  consisting of three branches, ( executive ,  legislature  and  judiciary ).   Afghanistan is currently led by President  Hamid Karzai , who was elected in October 2004. The current  parliament  was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members, communists,  reformists , and  Islamic fundamentalists . 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3 points more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, long known under the Taliban for its  oppression of women , one of the leading countries in terms of female representation. Construction for a new parliament building began on August 29, 2005.   The  Supreme Court of Afghanistan  is currently led by Chief Justice  Abdul Salam Azimi , a former university professor who had been legal advisor to the president. [ 57 ]  The previous court, appointed during the time of the interim government, had been dominated by fundamentalist religious figures, including Chief Justice  Faisal Ahmad Shinwari . The court issued several rulings, such as banning  cable television , seeking to ban a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and limiting the rights of women, as well as overstepping its constitutional authority by issuing rulings on subjects not yet brought before the court. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more  technocrats  than the previous court, although it has yet to issue any rulings.          Military 90 day training course provided by the United States to train elite commandos for the  Afghan National Army  in Kabul         See also:  Constitution of Afghanistan       Law enforcement and military       Main articles:  Law enforcement in Afghanistan  and  Military of Afghanistan       Afghanistan currently has more than 70,000  national police  officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 80,000. They are being trained by and through the  Afghanistan Police Program . Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, sometimes local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners. In 2003 the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, now under command of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) was extended and expanded beyond the  Kabul  area. However, in some areas unoccupied by those forces, local militias maintain control. In many areas, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police and/or communications. Troops of the  Afghan National Army  have been sent to quell fighting in some regions lacking police protection. [ 58 ]     Administrative divisions       Main articles:  Provinces of Afghanistan  and  Districts of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is administratively divided into thirty-four (34)  provinces  ( welayats ), and for each province there is a capital. Each province is then divided into many provincial  districts , and each district normally covers a city or several  townships .   The  Governor  of the province is appointed by the  Ministry of Interior , and the  Prefects  for the districts of the province will be appointed by the provincial Governor. The Governor is the representative of the central government of Afghanistan, and is responsible for all administrative and formal issues. The provincial  Chief of Police  is appointed by the Ministry of Interior, who works together with the Governor on law enforcement for all the cities or districts of that province.   There is an exception in the capital city (Kabul) where the  Mayor  is selected by the  President of Afghanistan , and is completely independent from the  prefecture  of the  Kabul Province .

Therefore, relations between Afghanistan and NATO members is strong. Afghanistan depends a lot on multi-billion dollar aid infusions from the United States. Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany are also large donors.   Relations between Afghanistan and the  Islamic Republic of Iran  are very strong. The two nations share the same language and culture, and both countries are part of  Greater Persia . Shiites and Sunnis get a long well in Afghanistan which causes no religious tensions between the two nations. Iran is a consistent donor towards Afghan reconstruction.   Afghan and Pakistani relations always fluctuate. The two nations are always disputing, but recent relations have deteriorated vastly. Afghan Intelligence and American agencies accuse Pakistan of working to stop Afghan reconstruction mainly through the  Inter-Services Intelligence . Most of the Taliban come from Pakistan and Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Pakistan. Afghanistan and Pakistan recently fought a series of border skirmishes and the US has lead several air strikes in Pakistani territory from Afghan air bases.   Afghanistan maintains excellent relations with their Northern Allies, including  Uzbekistan ,  Tajikistan  and  Turkmenistan  as all three share a similar culture as the Afghans.  Hazaras  are from those nations. Afghanistan also has good relations with Russia and India. India is a leading investor in Afghanistan, alongside Iran.   Afghanistan has excellent relations with the rest of the Arab and  Muslim world .     Demographics       Main article:  Demography of Afghanistan       Further information:  Refugees of Afghanistan   A July 2008 estimate of the total Afghan population is 32,738,376. [ 59 ]     Largest cities     See also:  List of cities in Afghanistan  and  Places in Afghanistan     The only city in Afghanistan with over one million residents is its capital, Kabul. The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size,  Kandahar ,  Herat ,  Mazar-e Sharif ,  Jalalabad ,  Ghazni  and  Kunduz .     Ethnic groups   The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are not available. [ 60 ]  Therefore most figures are approximations only:           Ethnic groups of Afghanistan )        36.4% to 42.0%  Pashtun         27% to 38.0%  Tajik         8.0% to 10.0%  Hazara         6.0% to 9.2%  Uzbek          0.1% to 4%  Aimak         1.7 to 3%  Turkmen         0.5% to 4%  Baloch          1.9% to 9.2% other ( Pashai ,  Hindki ,  Nuristani ,  Brahui ,  Hindkowans , etc.)               Languages of Afghanistan   (percentages are from  CIA World Factbook ) [ 1 ]         50%  Dari (Eastern Persian)         35%  Pashto         8%  Uzbek         3%  Turkmen         4%  Balochi         2% other ( Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui , etc.)             (1) Based on official census numbers from the 1960s to the 1980s, as well as information found in mainly scholarly sources, the  Encyclopdia Iranica [ 61 ]  gives the following list:     39.4% Pashtun   33.7% Tajik,  Farsiwan , and  Qezelbash   8.0% Hazara   8.0% Uzbek   4.1% Aimak   3.3% Turkmen   1.6% Baloch   1.9% other           (2) An approximate distribution of ethnic groups based on the  CIA World Factbook [ 1 ]  is as following:     Pashtun: 42%   Tajik: 27%   Hazara: 9%   Uzbek: 9%   Aimak: 4%   Turkmen: 3%   Baloch : 2%   Other: 4%                             (3) According to a representative survey, named  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , a combined project of  The Asia Foundation , the  Indian   Centre for the Study of Developing Societies  (CSDS) and the  Afghan Center for Socio-economic and Opinion Research  (ACSOR), the distribution of the ethnic groups is: [ 62 ]     40.9% Pashtun   37.1% Tajik   9.2% Hazara   9.2% Uzbek   1.7% Turkmen   0.5% Baloch   0.1% Aimak   1.3% other           (4) According to another representative survey, named  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand"" , a combined effort by the American broadcasting channel  ABC News , the British  BBC , and the German  ARD  (from the years 2004 to 2009), and released on February 9th 2009, the ethnic composition of the country is (avarege numbers): [ 63 ]     41% Pashtun   38% Tajik   10% Hazara   6% Uzbek   2% Turkmen   1% Nuristani   1% Baloch   1% other                         Languages       Main articles:  Languages of Afghanistan ,  Persian language , and  Pashto language       The most common languages spoken in Afghanistan are  Eastern Persian  (also known as Dari; roughly 50%) and Pashto (roughly 35%). Both are  Indo-European languages  from the  Iranian languages  sub-family, and the  official languages  of the country.  Hazaragi , spoken by the Hazara minority, is a distinct dialect of Persian. Other languages spoken include the  Turkic languages   Uzbek  and  Turkmen  (ca. 9% combined), as well as 30 minor languages, primarily  Balochi ,  Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui ,  Pamiri languages ,  Hindko , etc. (ca. 4% combined).  Bilingualism  is common.   According to the Encyclopdia Iranica, [ 64 ]  the Persian language is the most widely used language of the country, spoken by around 80% of the population, while Pashto is spoken and understood by around 50% of the population. According to  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , [ 62 ]  Persian is the first language of 49% of the population, while additional 37% speak the language as a second language (combined 86%). Pashto is the first language of 40% of the population, while additional 27% know the language (combined 67%). Uzbek is spoken or understood by 6% of the population, Turkmen by 3%. According to the survey  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand""  (avarege numbers from 2005-2009), 69% of the interviewed people preferred Persian, while 31% spoke Pashto. [ 63 ]     Culture       Main article:  Culture of Afghanistan       Afghans display pride in their religion, country, ancestry, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their  clan  loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. [ 65 ]  As clan warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.   Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of Buddha in the Bamyan Province were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as  idolatrous . Other famous sites include the cities of  Kandahar , Heart, Ghazni and Balkh. The Minaret of Jam, in the  Hari River  valley, is a  UNESCO World Heritage site . The cloak worn by  Muhammad  is stored inside the famous Khalka Sharifa in Kandahar City.   Buzkashi  is a national sport in Afghanistan. It is similar to  polo  and played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a  goat  carcass.  Afghan hounds  (a type of running  dog ) also originated in Afghanistan.   Although literacy levels are very low, classic  Persian poetry  plays a very important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in  Iran  and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Persian culture has, and continues to, exert a great influence over Afghan culture. Private poetry competition events known as mushaera are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every homeowner owns one or more poetry collections of some sort, even if they are not read often.   The eastern dialects of the Persian language are popularly known as ""Dari"". The name itself derives from ""Prs-e Darbr"", meaning  Persian of the royal courts . The ancient term  Dar   one of the original names of the Persian language  was revived in the Afghan constitution of 1964, and was intended ""to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language. Hence, the name  Frs , the language of  Frs , is strictly avoided."" [ 66 ]          Girls in Kabul, wearing their traditional clothes, sing at a celebration of International Women's Day       in 2002.]]   Many of the famous  Persian poets  of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from Khorasan where is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy.     Mawln Rumi , who was born and educated in Balkh in the thirteenth century and moved to  Konya  in modern-day  Turkey   Rabi'a Balkhi  (the first poetess in the History of Persian Poetry, tenth century, native of Balkh)   Daqiqi Balkhi  (tenth century, native of Balkh)   Farrukhi Sistani  (tenth century, the  Ghaznavids  royal poet)   Unsuri Balkhi  (a tenth/eleventh century poet, native of Balkh)   Khwaja Abdullah Ansari  (eleventh century, from Herat)   Nasir Khusraw  (eleventh century, from Qubadyan near Balkh)   Anvari  (twelfth century, lived and died in Balkh)   San' Ghaznawi  (twelfth century, native of Ghazni)   Jm of Hert  (fifteenth century, native of Herat in western Afghanistan), and his nephew Abdullah Hatifi Herawi, a well-known poet   Al Sher Nav'  (fifteenth century, Herat).     Most of these individuals were of Persian ( Tjk ) ethnicity who still form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-known in Persian-speaking world, include  Khalilullah Khalili , [ 67 ]  Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari, [ 68 ]  Sarwar Joya,  Parwin Pazwak  and others. In 2003, Khaled Hosseini published The  Kite Runner  which though fiction, captured much of the history, politics and culture experienced in Afghanistan from the 1930s to present day.   In addition to poets and authors, numerous  Persian scientists  were born or worked in the region of present-day Afghanistan. Most notable was  Avicenna  (Abu Al Hussein ibn Sn) whose father hailed from Balkh. Ibn Sn, who travelled to  Isfahan  later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as ""the father of modern medicine"". George Sarton called ibn Sn ""the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times."" His most famous works are  The Book of Healing  and  The Canon of Medicine , also known as the Qanun. Ibn Sn's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through  Noah Gordon 's  The Physician , now published in many languages. Moreover, according to  Ibn al-Nadim ,  Al-Farabi , a well-known philosopher and scientist, was from the Faryab Province of Afghanistan.   Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the  Nauroz -celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the twentieth century has been likened to  Vienna  during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.   The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is potent in political terms. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, they would assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders. In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call.   Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. [ 65 ]     Religions       Main article:  Religion in Afghanistan       Religiously, Afghans are over 99%  Muslims : approximately 74-80%  Sunni  and 19-25%  Shi'a [ 1 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ]  (estimates vary). Up until the mid-1980s, there were about 30,000 to 150,000  Hindus  and  Sikhs  living in different cities, mostly in  Jalalabad ,  Kabul , and  Kandahar . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   There was a small  Jewish  community in Afghanistan ( see  Bukharan Jews ) who fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual,  Zablon Simintov , remains today. [ 73 ]     Economy       Main article:  Economy of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is a member of the  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ,  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  and the  Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) . It is an impoverished country, one of the world's poorest and least developed. Two-thirds of the population lives on fewer than 2  US  dollars a day. Its economy has suffered greatly from the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 19982001. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). As of 2005, the official unemployment rate is at 40%. [ 76 ]  The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. [ 77 ]   The nation's economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion  US dollars  in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats. [ 78 ]  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.   The real value of  non-drug  GDP increased by 29% in 2002, 16% in 2003, 8% in 2004 and 14% in 2005. [ 79 ]  As much as one-third of Afghanistan's  GDP  comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including  opium  and its two derivatives,  morphine  and  heroin , as well as  hashish  production. [ 1 ]   Opium production in Afghanistan  has soared to a new record in 2007, with an increase on last year of more than a third, the United Nations has said. [ 80 ]  Some 3.3 million Afghans are now involved in producing opium. [ 81 ]  In a recent article in the  Washington Quarterly , Peter van Ham and Jorrit Kamminga argue that the international community should establish a pilot project and investigate a licensing scheme to start the production of medicines such as morphine and codeine from poppy crops to help it escape the economic dependence on opium: [ 82 ]   According to a 2004 report by the  Asian Development Bank , the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development. [ 77 ]  In 2006, two U.S. companies, Black & Veatch and the  Louis Berger Group , have won a US 1.4 billion dollar contract to rebuild roads, power lines and water supply systems of Afghanistan. [ 83 ]   One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 4 million refugees from neighbouring countries and the  West , who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. What is also helping is the estimated US 23 billion dollars in international assistance every year, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. Private developments are also beginning to get underway. In 2006, a Dubai-based Afghan family opened a $25 million  Coca Cola  bottling plant in Afghanistan. [ 84 ]   While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion  about 15%  is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the  United Nations  system and  non-governmental organizations . The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.   Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the Afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old Afghani by 1 new Afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003. [ 77 ]   The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels. Since 2003, over sixteen new banks have opened in the country, including  Afghanistan International Bank ,  Kabul Bank ,  Azizi Bank ,  Standard Chartered Bank ,  First Micro Finance Bank , and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year  tax holidays  to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports  tariffs  and duties.   Some private investment projects, backed with national support, are also beginning to pick up steam in Afghanistan. An initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr.  Hisham N. Ashkouri , Principal of ARCADD, Inc. for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue, [ 85 ]  revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the  Afghan National Museum .   According to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to 36 trillion cubic feet (1,000 km 3 ) of  natural gas , 3.6 billion barrels (570,000,000 m 3 ) of  petroleum  and up to 1,325 million barrels (2.107E+8 m 3 ) of  natural gas liquids . This could mark the turning point in Afghanistans reconstruction efforts. Energy exports could generate the revenue that Afghan officials need to modernize the countrys infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for the beleaguered and fractious population. [ 27 ]  Other reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal,  iron ore  and other  minerals . [ 24 ] [ 28 ] [ 86 ]  The government of Afghanistan is in the process of extracting and exporting its copper reserves, which will be earning $1.2 billion US dollars in  royalties  and taxes every year for the next 30 years. It will also provide permanent labor to 3,000 of its citizens.

International flights include to  Dubai ,  Frankfurt ,  Istanbul  and a number of other destinations. [ citation needed ]  There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from  Kam Air ,  Pamir Airways  and Safi Airlines.   The country has limited rail service with Turkmenistan. There are two  railway  projects currently in progress, one is between Herat and the Iranian city  Mashad  while another is between Kandahar and  Quetta  in Pakistan. Most people who travel from one city to another use bus services. Automobiles have recently become more widely available, with  Toyota ,  Nissan  and  Hyundai  dealerships in Kabul. A large number of second-hand vehicles are also arriving from the  UAE . Nearly all highways and roads are being rebuilt in the country.     Communications and technology       Main article:  Communications in Afghanistan       Telecommunication services in the country are provided by  Afghan Wireless ,  Etisalat ,  Roshan ,  Areeba  and  Afghan Telecom . In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a  US$ 64.5 million agreement with  ZTE Corporation  for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country. [ 88 ]  Around 500,000 (1.5% of the population) had internet access by the end of 2008. [ 89 ]   Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.   The nation's post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as  FedEx ,  DHL  and others are also available.     Media       Main article:  Media of Afghanistan       The media was tightly controlled under the  Taliban  and other periods in its history, and was relatively free in others. Under the Taliban, television was shut down in 1996, and print media were forbidden to publish commentary, photos or readers letters. [ 90 ]  The only radio station broadcast religious programmes and  propaganda , and aired no music. [ 90 ]   After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified.  Freedom of expression  and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and  censorship  is banned, though  defaming  individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of  Islam  is prohibited. In 2008,  Reporters Without Borders  listed the media environment as 156 out of 173, with 1st being most free. [ 91 ]  400 publications are now registered and 60 radio stations, a major source of information, currently exist. [ 92 ]  Foreign radio stations, such as the  BBC World Service , also broadcast into the country. However,  press freedom  is threatened by the continuing  war in Afghanistan , with kidnappings of journalists, harassment and death threats.     Education       Main article:  Education in Afghanistan       As of 2006 more than four million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout the country. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. A lack of women teachers is an issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men. [ 93 ]   Literacy of the entire population is estimated (as of 1999) at 36%, the male literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. Up to now there are 9,500 schools in the country.   Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of  higher education .

clueweb09-enwp00-47-10727	"                     Civil Rights Act of 1964          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 First page of the Civil Rights Act of 1964           Civil Rights Act of 1964       Long title:   An Act to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States of America to provide relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity, and for other purposes.       The  Civil Rights Act of 1964  ( Pub.L.  88-352, 78  Stat.  241, July 2, 1964) was a landmark piece of  legislation  in the  United States  that outlawed  racial segregation  in schools, public places, and employment. Conceived to help  African Americans , the bill was amended prior to passage to protect women, and explicitly included white people for the first time. It also created the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .   In order to circumvent limitations on congressional power to enforce the  Equal Protection Clause  imposed by the Supreme Court in the  Civil Rights Cases , the law was passed under the  Commerce Clause , which had been interpreted by the courts as a broad grant of congressional power. Once the Act was implemented, its effects were far reaching and had tremendous long-term impacts on the whole country. It prohibited discrimination in public facilities, in government, and in employment, invalidating the  Jim Crow laws  in the southern U.S. It became illegal to compel segregation of the races in schools, housing, or hiring. Powers given to enforce the bill were initially weak, but were supplemented during later years.

Kennedy addresses the nation about Civil Rights on June 11, 1963       The bill was introduced by President  John F. Kennedy  in his civil rights speech of June 11, 1963, [ 1 ]  in which he asked for legislation ""giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the publichotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments,"" as well as ""greater protection for the right to vote.""   He then sent a bill to Congress on June 19. Emulating the  Civil Rights Act of 1875 , Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations, and to enable the  U.S. Attorney General  to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. But it did not include a number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Passage           Lyndon B. Johnson  signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among the guests behind him is  Martin Luther King, Jr.         [ edit ]   Passage in the House of Representatives   The bill was sent to the  House of Representatives , and referred to the  House Judiciary Committee , chaired by  Emmanuel Celler . After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee greatly strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly-owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial ""Title III"" that had been removed from the  1957  and  1960  Acts. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.   The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963, and was then referred to the  Rules Committee , whose chairman,  Howard W. Smith , a Democrat from  Virginia , indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely. It was at this point that President Kennedy was assassinated. The new president,  Lyndon Johnson , utilized his experience in legislative politics and the  bully pulpit  he wielded as president in support of the bill.   Because of Smith's stalling of the bill in the Rules Committee, Celler filed a petition to discharge the bill from the Committee. Only if a majority of members signed the  discharge petition  would the bill move directly to the House floor without consideration by Smith's committee. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, as even many congressmen who supported the civil rights bill itself were cautious about violating House procedure with the discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.   On the return from the winter recess, however, matters took a significant turn. The pressure of the civil rights movement, the  March on Washington , and the President's public advocacy of the Act had made a difference of opinion in Representatives' home districts, and soon it became apparent that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To prevent the humiliation of the success of the petition, Chairman Smith allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee. The bill was brought to a vote in the House on February 10, 1964, and passed by a vote of 290 to 130, and sent to the Senate.     [ edit ]   Passage in the Senate           Martin Luther King, Jr.  and  Malcolm X  at the  United States Capitol  on March 26, 1964. Both men had come to hear the Senate debate on the bill. This was the only time the two men ever met; their meeting lasted only one minute. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]       Johnson, who wanted the bill passed as soon as possible, ensured that the bill would be quickly considered by the  Senate . Normally, the bill would have been referred to the  Senate Judiciary Committee , chaired by Senator  James O. Eastland ,  Democrat  from  Mississippi . Under Eastland's care, it seemed impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor.  Senate Majority Leader   Mike Mansfield  took a novel approach to prevent the bill from being relegated to Judiciary Committee limbo. Having initially waived a second reading of the bill, which would have led to it being immediately referred to Judiciary, Mansfield gave the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, and then proposed, in the absence of precedent for instances when a second reading did not immediately follow the first, that the bill bypass the Judiciary Committee and immediately be sent to the Senate floor for debate. Although this parliamentary move led to a brief  filibuster , the senators eventually let it pass, preferring to concentrate their resistance on passage of the bill itself.   The bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964 and the ""Southern Bloc"" of southern Senators led by  Richard Russell  (D-GA) launched a filibuster to prevent its passage. Said Russell "" We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our (Southern) states. "" [ 5 ]   After 54 days of filibuster, Senators  Everett Dirksen  (R-IL), Thomas Kuchel (R-CA),  Hubert Humphrey  (D-MN), and Mike Mansfield (D-MT) introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would attract enough Republican votes to end the filibuster. The compromise bill was weaker than the House version in regard to government power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak as to cause the House to reconsider the legislation. [ 6 ]   On the morning of June 10, 1964, Senator  Robert Byrd  (D-W.Va.) completed an address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 57 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to cloture for any measure.

Johnson  of July 2, 1964 about the Civil Rights Act of 1964.                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Shortly thereafter, the substitute (compromise) bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73-27, and quickly passed through the House-Senate  conference committee , which adopted the Senate version of the bill. The conference bill was passed by both houses of Congress, and was signed into law by President Johnson on July 2, 1964. Legend has it that as he put down his pen Johnson told an aide, ""We have lost the South for a generation.""

Mechem  of  New Mexico ,  Milward L. Simpson  of  Wyoming , and  Norris H. Cotton  of  New Hampshire  opposed the measure)       [ edit ]   Women's rights   The prohibition on sex discrimination was added by  Howard W. Smith , a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and who had strongly opposed the Civil Rights Act. The addition of ""sex"" to title VII is commonly described as a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by inserting objectionable amendments. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  Smith knew Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would vote for the amendment along with southern Democrats and get it in the final bill. [ 12 ]  Smith thought that northern Democrats would not vote for the bill due to the inclusion of gender, because the clause was opposed by  labor unions  which the northern Democrats aligned themselves with. [ 12 ]  Representative  Carl Elliott  of Alabama later claimed, ""Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights...he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights,"" [ 13 ]  and the  Congressional Record  records that Smith was greeted by laughter when he introduced the amendment. [ 14 ]   Smith nevertheless claimed that he sincerely supported the amendment and made serious arguments in its favor. [ 14 ]  The claim was not entirely ungrounded, as Smith had long been close to  Alice Paul , a women's rights activist who urged him to include sex as a protected category. The amendment had been forcefully promoted by the National Woman's Party and its allies in Congress, who had no desire to scuttle the Civil Rights Act.

Vinson ,  The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives...the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Acts prohibition against discrimination based on sex.  [ 15 ]   However, the idea that banishing sex-based discrimination was ridiculous is undermined by the passage, just one year prior, of the  Equal Pay Act  (EPA) by the same Congress. [ citation needed ]  The EPA had, as its main objective, abolished wage differentials based on sex. It seemed unlikely that, the following year, the very same Congress would view sex-based discrimination as ridiculous or that any member of that Congress would believe that the addition of sex as a protected class would scuttle the bill. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Desegregation   One of the most ""damaging"" arguments by the bill's opponents was that once passed, the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain  racial quotas  in schools. [ 16 ]  Proponents of the bill, such as  Emanuel Celler  and  Jacob Javits , said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor  Hubert Humphrey  wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing. [ 16 ]  Humphrey said ""if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race."" [ 16 ]  While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes ""would be making a fool of himself,"" two years later the  Department of Health, Education and Welfare  said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Political repercussions          President Johnson speaks to a television camera at the signing of the Civil Rights Act.       The bill divided and engendered a long-term change in the demographics of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. As Vice President, Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration to introduce civil rights legislation, telling Kennedy aide  Ted Sorensen  that ""I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway."" [ 17 ]  Senator  Richard Russell, Jr.  warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill ""will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election."" [ 18 ]  The South indeed started to vote increasingly Republican after 1964. However, political scientists  Richard Johnston  and  Byron Schafer  have argued that this development was based more on economics than on race.  [ 19 ]   Although majorities in both parties voted for the bill, there were notable exceptions.  Republican  senator  Barry Goldwater  of Arizona voted against the bill, remarking, ""You can't legislate morality."" Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass Civil Rights legislation in 1957 and 1960. The reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which he viewed as a violation of individual liberty. Most Democrats from the Southern states opposed the bill, including Senators  Albert Gore Sr.  (D-TN),  J. William Fulbright  (D-AR), and  Robert Byrd  (D-WV).     [ edit ]   Major features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964   (The full text of the Act is available  online .)     [ edit ]   Title I   Barred unequal application of voter registration requirements.     ""It shall be the duty of the judge designated pursuant to this section to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.""'     Title I did not eliminate literacy tests, which were one of the main methods used to exclude Black voters in the South, nor did it address economic retaliation, police repression, or physical violence against nonwhite voters. While the Act did require that voting rules and procedures be applied equally to all races, it failed to challenge the fundamental concept of voter ""qualification."" That is, it accepted the idea that citizens do not have an automatic right to vote but rather might have to meet some standard beyond citizenship. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Title II   Outlawed discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; exempted private clubs without defining the term ""private.""     [ edit ]   Title III   Prohibited state and municipal governments from denying access to public facilities on grounds of race, religion, gender, or ethnicity.     [ edit ]   Title IV   Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U.S. Attorney General to file suits to enforce said act.     [ edit ]   Title V   Expanded the  Civil Rights Commission  established by the earlier  Civil Rights Act of 1957  with additional powers, rules and procedures.     [ edit ]   Title VI   Prevented discrimination by government agencies that receive federal funding. If an agency is found in violation of Title VI, that agency can lose its federal funding.   General   This title declares it to be the policy of the United States that discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin shall not occur in connection with programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance and authorizes and directs the appropriate Federal departments and agencies to take action to carry out this policy. This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs. Section 601  This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.   Section 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.   Section 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 USC 1009). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action ""committed to agency discretion,"" which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.     [ edit ]   Title VII   Title VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of  42 U.S.C.    2000e  [2] et seq., prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see  42 U.S.C.    2000e-2 [ 21 ] ).   Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. An employer cannot discriminate against a person because of his interracial association with another, such as by an interracial marriage. [ 22 ]   In very narrow defined situations an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. In order to prove the Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between sex and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the ""essence"" or ""central mission of the employer's business,"" and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.,  499 U.S. 187  (1991)  111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on sex (Dothard v. Rawlinson,  433 U.S. 321  (1977)  97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School  Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).   Title VII allows for any employer, labor organization, joint labor-management committee, or employment agency to bypass the ""unlawful employment practice"" for any person involved with the  Communist Party of the United States  or of any other organization required to register as a Communist-action or Communist-front organization by final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board pursuant to the  Subversive Activities Control Act  of 1950.   There are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:     Federal government; (Comment: The proscriptions against employment discrimination under Title VII are now applicable to the federal government under  42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-16 )   Indian Tribes   Religious groups performing work connected to the group's activities, including associated education institutions;   Bona fide nonprofit private membership organizations.     The  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC) as well as certain  state fair employment practices agencies  (FEPAs) enforce Title VII (see  42 U.S.C.    2000e-4 [ 21 ] ). The EEOC and state FEPAs investigate, mediate, and may file lawsuits on behalf of employees. Every state, except Arkansas and Alabama maintains a state FEPA (see EEOC and state FEPA  directory  ). Title VII also provides that an individual can bring a private lawsuit. An individual must file a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of learning of the discrimination or the individual may lose the right to file a lawsuit. Title VII only applies to employers who employ 15 or more employees for more than 19 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.   In the late 1970s courts began holding that  sexual harassment  is also prohibited under the Act.  Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal  is a notable Title VII case relating to sexual harassment that was decided in favor of the plaintiffs. In 1986 the  Supreme Court  held in  Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson ,  477 U.S. 57  (1986) , that sexual harassment is sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII. Same-sex sexual harassment has also been held to be prohibited by Title VII (Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,  523 U.S. 75  (1998) , 118 S.Ct. 998). Title VII has been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination ( See   Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 ,  Age Discrimination in Employment Act [ 23 ]  ,  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ).     [ edit ]   Title VIII   Required compilation of voter-registration and voting data in geographic areas specified by the Commission on Civil Rights.     [ edit ]   Title IX   Made it easier to move civil rights cases from state courts with segregationist judges and all-white juries to federal court. This was of crucial importance to civil rights activists who could not get a fair trial in state courts.     [ edit ]   Title X   Established the Community Relations Service, tasked with assisting in community disputes involving claims of discrimination to people of color.     [ edit ]   Subsequent history   In a 1971 Supreme Court case regarding the gender provisions of the Act, the Court ruled that a company could not discriminate against a potential female employee because she had a preschool-age child unless they did the same with potential male employees. [ 12 ]  A federal court overruled an  Ohio  state law that barred women from obtaining jobs which required the ability to lift 25 pounds and required women to take lunch breaks when men were not required to. [ 12 ]  A Pennsylvania state court decided that printing separate job listings for men and women was illegal, which ended that practice among the country's newspapers. [ 12 ]  The  United States Civil Service Commission  ended the practice among federal jobs which designated them ""women only"" or ""men only."" [ 12 ]   In 1975, a federal civil rights agency warned a  Phoenix, Arizona  school that its end-of-year father-son and mother-daughter baseball games were illegal according to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. [ 12 ]  President  Gerald Ford  intervened, and the games were allowed to continue. [ 12 ]  In 1977, the Supreme Court struck down state minimum height requirements for police officers as violating the Act; women usually could not meet these requirements. [ 12 ]   In 1974, the Supreme Court also ruled that the  San Francisco  school district was violating non-English speaking students' rights under the 1964 act by placing them in regular classes rather than providing some sort of accommodation for them.

The Executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold office during the term of four years, and together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows:     2. Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.  The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President.

These  unapproved  articles are subject to  a disclaimer . [ edit intro ]              The  Republic of South Africa  is a country located at the southern tip of the African continent. It borders  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique , and  Swaziland , while a sixth country,  Lesotho , is an  enclave  entirely surrounded by South African territory.  South Africa has experienced a significantly different evolution from other nations in Africa as a result of two facts. Firstly, immigration from Europe reached levels not experienced in other African communities. Secondly, the strategic importance of the Cape Sea Route, as emphasised by the closure of the Suez Canal during the Six Day War, and mineralogical wealth made the country extremely important to Western interests, particularly during the Cold War.  As a result of the former, South Africa is a very racially diverse nation. It has the largest population of people of 'coloured' (mixed race) communities in Africa.  Black South Africans account for slightly less than 80% of the population.  Racial strife between the white minority and the black majority has played a large part in the country's history and politics, culminating in apartheid, an official policy of 'separate development', which was instituted in 1948 by the National Party, although segregation existed prior to that date. The laws that defined apartheid began to be repealed or abolished by the National Party in 1990 after a long and sometimes violent struggle (including economic sanctions from the international community) by the black majority as well as many white, coloured, and Indian South Africans.  The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'tat, and regular elections have been held for almost a century; however, the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994.  The economy of South Africa is the largest and best developed on the continent, with modern infrastructure common throughout the country.  South Africa is often referred to as The Rainbow Nation - a term coined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and later elaborated upon by then-President Nelson Mandela as a metaphor to describe the country's newly-developing multicultural diversity in the wake of segregationist apartheid ideology.  South Africa will be the host nation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. It will be the first time the tournament is held in Africa.

Extensive  fossil  remains at the  Sterkfontein ,  Kromdraai  and Makapansgat caves suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including  Homo habilis ,  Homo erectus  and modern man,  Homo sapiens .  Bantu -speaking peoples (the term Bantu is a linguistic term not an ethnic one),  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen, moved south of the  Limpopo River  into modern-day South Africa by the 4th or 5th century (the  Bantu expansion ) displacing the original Khoi and San speakers. They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day  KwaZulu-Natal Province  are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the  Xhosa  people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoi and San people, reaching the  Fish River , in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These  Iron Age  populations displaced earlier  hunter-gatherer  peoples as they migrated.  The written history of South Africa begins with the accounts of European navigators passing South Africa on the  East Indies  trade routes.  Subsequent to the first circumnavigation of the Cape in  1488  by the Portuguese Explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  a number of shipwrecks occurred along the Southern African coast.  Along with the accounts of the early navigators, the accounts of shipwreck survivors provide the earliest written accounts of Southern Africa.  In the two centuries following 1488 a number of small fishing settlements were made along the coast by  Portuguese  sailors, but no written account of these settlements survives.  In  1652  a victualling station was established at the  Cape of Good Hope  by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company . For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a  Dutch  possession. The Dutch settlers eventually met the southwesterly expanding  Xhosa  people in the region of the  Fish River . A series of wars, called  Cape Frontier Wars , ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   To ease Cape labour shortages  slaves  were brought from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and  India . Furthermore, troublesome leaders, often of royal descent, were banished from Dutch colonies to South Africa. This group of slaves eventually gave rise to a population that now identifies themselves as "" Cape Malays "".  Cape Malays  have traditionally been accorded a higher social status by the European colonists - many became wealthy landowners, but became increasingly dispossessed as  Apartheid  developed. Cape Malay mosques in  District Six  were spared, and now serve as monuments for the destruction that occurred around them.   Most of the descendants of these slaves, who often married with Dutch settlers, were later classified together with the remnants of the Khoikhoi as  Cape Coloureds . Further intermingling within the  Cape Coloured  population itself, as well as with  Xhosa  and other South African people, now means that they constitute roughly 50% of the population in the  Western Cape Province .  Great Britain  seized the  Cape of Good Hope  area in 1797 during the  Fourth Anglo-Dutch War . The  Dutch East India Company  declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1805. The British continued the frontier wars against the AmaXhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging  British settlement . Due to pressure of  abolitionist  societies in Britain, the British parliament first stopped its global  slave trade  in 1806, then abolished slavery in all its colonies in 1833.       (PD) Photo: Library of Congress   British  troops during the  Second Boer War , 1900. The UK eventually won the war, and absorbed the two Boer republics into the empire.   The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1886 encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the natives. The  Boers  successfully resisted British encroachments during the  First Boer War  (1880–1881) using tactics much better suited to local conditions. For example, the Boers wore  khaki  clothing, which was the same colour as the earth, whereas the British wore bright red uniforms, making them easy targets for Boer  sharpshooters . The British returned in greater numbers without their red jackets in the  Second Boer War  (1899–1902), which was largely opposed by the  Liberal Party  in the  British Parliament . The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with German  South West Africa  provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics.  The Boers resisted fiercely, but the British eventually overwhelmed the Boer forces, using their superior numbers and external supply chains and  concentration camps  as well as the controversial  scorched earth  tactic. The  Treaty of Vereeniging  specified full British sovereignty over the South African republics, and the British government agreed to assume the   3,000,000 war debt owed by the Afrikaner governments. One of the main provisions of the treaty ending the war was that 'Blacks' would not be allowed to vote, except in the Cape Colony.  After four years of negotiations, the  Union of South Africa  was created from the  Cape  and  Natal  colonies, as well as the republics of  Orange Free State  and  Transvaal , on  May 31 ,  1910 , exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly-created Union of South Africa was a  dominion . In 1934 the  South African Party  and  National Party  merged to form the  United Party , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and  English -speaking 'Whites', but split in 1939 over the Union's entry into  World War II  as an ally of the  United Kingdom . The right-wing National Party sympathised with  Nazi Germany  during the war, and sought greater racial segregation, or apartheid, after it.  In 1948, the  National Party  was elected to power, and began  implementing a series of harsh segregationist laws  that would become known collectively as  apartheid . Not surprisingly, this segregation also applied to the wealth acquired during rapid industrialization of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. While the White minority enjoyed the highest  standard of living  in all of Africa, often comparable to "" First World "" western nations, the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy.  However, the average income and life expectancy of a black, 'Indian' or 'colored' South African compared favorably to many other African states, such as  Ghana  and  Tanzania .       (GNU) Photo: Ulrich Stelzner   Apartheid  era sign at a public beach, 1985.   Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread  sanctions  and  divestment  abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also special section on  History of South Africa in the apartheid era .) A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and resistance,  strikes , marches, protests, and  sabotage , by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the  African National Congress  (ANC), followed.  In 1987 the SADF go in Angola to help the UNITA, but in  Battle of Cuito Cuanavale  South Africa and UNITA are defeated by  Cuba  and  Angola [1] . A few months later, 1988, Cuba defeated the SADF again in  Calueque , wining the  Bush War , so called  Border War  or  Angola War [2] . Then South Africa ask for the peace and accept several conditions never accepted before [3] .  In 1989 elections are summoned in  Namibia  with every parties, included  SWAPO . In 1990 Namibia is independent.  In 1990 the National Party government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the African National Congress and other  left-wing  political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after 27 years. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and the first  multi-racial elections  were held in 1994. The ANC won by an overwhelming majority, and has been in power ever since.   Despite the end of apartheid, millions of South Africans, mostly black, continue to live in  poverty . This is attributed to the legacy of the apartheid regime and, increasingly, what many see as the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. However, the ANC's social housing policy has produced some improvement in living conditions in many areas by redirecting fiscal spending and improving the efficiency of the  tax  collection system.      Politics    South Africa has a bicameral  Parliament : the  National Council of Provinces  (or upper house) with 90 members, and a  National Assembly  (or lower house) with 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by  proportional representation : half of the members are elected from national lists and half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the  President .  Current South African politics is dominated by the  African National Congress  (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the last  2004 general election  and 66.3% of the vote in the  2006 municipal election . The main challenger to the ANC's rule is the  Democratic Alliance  party, which received  12.4% of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8% in the 2006 election. The leader of this party is  Tony Leon . The formerly dominant  New National Party , which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the  National Party , has suffered increasing humiliation at election polls since 1994, and finally voted to disband.  It chose to merge with the ANC on  9 April   2005 . Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the  Inkatha Freedom Party , which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the  Independent Democrats , who took 6.97% and 1.7% of the vote respectively in the 2004 election.      Administrative divisions    When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent  Bantustans  into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa ( Cape Province ,  Natal ,  Orange Free State , and  Transvaal ) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically is in order to give local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further sub-divided into 52  districts , six of which are  metropolitan  and 46  district municipalities . The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into 231 local  municipalities . The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) which are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.      Geography       (CC) Photo: Paul Watson   Dawn on  Robben Island  looking towards  Cape Town .   South Africa is located at the extreme south of Africa, with a long  coastline  that stretches more than 2,500  kilometres  (1,550  mi ) and across two  oceans  (the  Atlantic  and the  Indian ). At 470,979  mi  (1,219,912  km [1] ), South Africa is the world's 25th-largest country (after  Mali ). It is comparable in size to  Colombia , and is nearly twice the size of the US state of  Texas .   South Africa has a great variety of climate zones, from the extreme  desert  of the  Kalahari  near  Namibia  to lush  subtropical  climate along the border with  Mozambique . It quickly rises over a  mountainous   escarpment  towards the interior  plateau  known as the  Highveld . Even though South Africa is classified as  semi-arid , there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as  topography .  The interior of South Africa is a giant, mountainous, and sparsely populated  scrubland   Karoo  plateau, which is drier towards the northwest along the Kalahari desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered, which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the  Mediterranean  with wet winters and hot, dry summers. This area also produces much of South Africa's  wine . This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the  Cape of Good Hope  particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many  shipwrecks . Further east on the country's south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the  Garden Route .  The  Free State  is particularly flat due to the fact that the eastern region of the Highveld does not extend as far north as the western region. North of the  Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740  metres  (5,709  ft ) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30  in ). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare.  To the north and east of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the Highveld's escarpment, and turns into the  Lowveld . The Lowveld has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of traditional South African  Bushveld . The high  Drakensberg mountains , which form the eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited  skiing  opportunities in winter. Many people think that the coldest place in South Africa is  Sutherland  in the western  Roggeveld Mountains , where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as –15 degrees  Celsius  (5  F ). In fact, the coldest place is actually Buffelsfontein, which is in the Molteno district of the Eastern Cape. Buffelsfontein  recorded  a low of –18.6 degrees  Celsius . The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 C (125 F) was recorded in 1948 in the  Northern Cape  Kalahari near  Upington . [4]   South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-antarctic archipelago of the  Prince Edward Islands , consisting of Marion Island (290 km/112 mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km/17.3 mi) (not to be confused with the  Canadian province of the same name ).      Flora and fauna    South Africa has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity.   South Africa's most prevalent biome is  grassland , particularly on the  Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different  grasses , low  shrubs , and  acacia trees , mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low  rainfall . There are several species of water-storing  succulents  like  aloes  and euphorbias in the very hot and dry  Namaqualand  area. The grass and thorn  savannah  turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the northeast of the country, with more dense growth. There are significant numbers of  baobab  trees in this area, near the northern end of  Kruger National Park . [5]   The  Fynbos   Biome , one of the six  floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the  Western Cape  and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are  evergreen  hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the  sclerophyllous  plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the  protea  genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa.  While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the  humid   coastal plain  along the  Indian Ocean  in  KwaZulu-Natal . There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of  fire , known as montane forests.  Plantations  of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native  eucalyptus  and  pine . South Africa has lost extensive acreage of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to  overpopulation  and sprawling development patterns.  South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many e.g. Black Wattle, Port Jackson,  Hakea ,  Lantana  and  Jacaranda  posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original  temperate forest  that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African  hardwood  trees like  Real Yellowwood   (Podocarpus latifolius) ,  stinkwood   (Ocotea bullata) , and South African  Black Ironwood   (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection.  Numerous mammals are found in the  bushveld  habitats including  lion ,  leopard ,  White Rhino ,  Blue Wildebeest ,  kudu ,  impala  and  giraffe .  There is a significant extent of the bushveld habitat in the northeast including Kruger National Park and the  Mala Mala  Reserve, as well as in the far north in the  Waterberg Biosphere .   "

For the region, see  Southern Africa . For the former country in the Transvaal, see   South African Republic.         The  Republic of South Africa  is a country located at the southern tip of the  African  continent. It borders the countries of  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique , and  Swaziland .  Lesotho  is an   enclave entirely surrounded by South African territory. South Africa has experienced a significantly different evolution than other nations in Africa arising primarily from two facts: immigration from  Europe  reached levels not experienced in other African communities and a level of mineralogical wealth that made the country extremely important to Western interests particularly during the   Cold War. As a result of the former, South Africa is a very racially diverse nation. It has the largest population of people of   Coloured (i.e., mixed racial background),  European , and   Indian communities in Africa. Black South Africans account for roughly 75% of the population. Racial strife between the white minority and the black majority have played a large part in the country's   history and   politics, culminating in   apartheid which was instituted in 1948 by the   National Party. The laws that defined apartheid began to be repealed or abolished in 1990 after a long and violent struggle by the black majority, as well as some White, Coloured, and Indian South Africans. The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a   coup d'état, and regular elections - albeit, for a small minority of the population -have been held for almost a century; black South Africans were only   enfranchised in 1994. The   economy of South Africa is the largest and best developed on the continent, with modern   infrastructure common throughout the country. South Africa is often referred to as   The Rainbow Nation - a term coined by   Archbishop  Desmond Tutu  and later elaborated upon by then-President  Nelson Mandela  as a metaphor to describe the country's newly-developing multicultural diversity in the wake of separatist   Apartheidist ideology.                  History                             Painting of an account of the arrival of   Jan van Riebeeck.                                                         Boer women and children in British   concentration camps.                          South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological sites in Africa. Extensive  fossil  remains at the   Sterkfontein,   Kromdraai and Makapansgat caves suggest that various   australopithecines existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. These were succeeded by various species of  Homo , including   Homo habilis ,   Homo erectus  and modern man,   Homo sapiens .  Bantu   iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen moved south of the   Limpopo River into modern-day South Africa by the   4th or 5th century (the   Bantu expansion). They slowly moved south and the earliest ironworks in modern-day   KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southermost group was the   Xhosa people, reaching the   Fish River, in today's  Eastern Cape Province . These   Iron Age populations displaced earlier  hunter-gatherer  peoples as they migrated. The written history of South Africa began on   April 6,   1652, when a victualing station was established at the   Cape of Good Hope by   Jan van Riebeeck on behalf of the   Dutch East India Company. For most of the   17th and   18th centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a  Dutch  possession. The Dutch settlers eventually met the South-Westerly expanding   Xhosa people in the region of the Fish River. A series of wars, called   Cape Frontier Wars, ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and live-stock interests. To ease Cape labour shortages   slaves were imported from  Indonesia ,  Madagascar , and  India . Descendants of these slaves, who often married with Dutch settlers, were later classified together with the remnants of the Khoikhoi as   Cape Coloureds and ""  Cape Malays"", constituting roughly 50% of the population in the   Western Cape Province.           Great Britain seized the   Cape of Good Hope area in 1797 during the   Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The Dutch declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1805. The British continued the frontier wars against the AmaXhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging   British settlement. Due to pressure of abolitionist societies in Britain, the British parliament first stopped its global slave trade in 1806, then abolished slavery in all its colonies in 1833. The discovery of  diamonds  in 1867 and  gold  in 1886 encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the natives. The   Boers successfully resisted British encroachments during the   First Boer War (1880–1881) basing their tactics much better on local conditions. For example, the Boers wore   khaki clothing, which was the same colour as the earth, whereas the British wore bright red uniforms, making them easy targets for Boer sharpshooters. The British returned in greater numbers without their red jackets in the  Second Boer War  (1899–1902), which was largely opposed by the   Liberal Party in the   British Parliament. The Boers' attempt to ally themselves with German   South West Africa provided the British with yet another excuse to take control of the Boer Republics. The Boers resisted fiercely, but the British eventually overwhelmed the Boer forces, using their superior numbers and external supply chains, as well as the controversial   scorched earth tactic. The   Treaty of Vereeniging specified full British sovereignty over the South African republics, and the British government agreed to assume the   £3,000,000 war debt owed by the Afrikaner governments. One of the main provisions of the treaty ending the war was that blacks would not be allowed to vote, except in the Cape Colony. After four years of negotiations, the   Union of South Africa was created from the colonies of   Cape Colony,   Natal Colony, and the republics of   Orange Free State, and   Transvaal on   May 31,   1910, exactly eight years after the end of the Second Boer War. The newly-created Union of South Africa was a   dominion. In 1934 the   South African Party and   National Parties merged to form the   United Party, seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and  English -speaking whites, but split in 1939 over the Union's entry in  World War II  as an ally of the  United Kingdom . The right-wing National Party sympathised with   Nazi Germany during the war, and sought greater racial segregation, or apartheid after it. After World War II, by the   National Party's takeover in 1948, the white minority were able to maintain their powergrip by implementing the policies that would become known collectively as   apartheid, a series of harsh racist laws segregating the country along racial lines. Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread   sanctions and   divestment abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. (See also special section on   History of South Africa in the apartheid era.) A long period of harsh supression by the government, and resistance,   strikes, marches, protests, and   sabotage, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the   African National Congress(ANC) followed. In 1990 National Party government took the first step towards negotiating itself out of power when it lifted the ban on the African National Congress and other   left-wing political organisations, and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after 27 years. Apartheid legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and the first   multi-racial elections were held in 1994. The ANC won by an overwhelming majority, and has been in power ever since. South Africa is the first, and to date only, country to build   nuclear weapons and then voluntarily dismantle its entire nuclear weapons programme. Despite the end of apartheid, millions of South Africans, mostly black, continue to live in  poverty . The reason for this is attributed to the legacy of the apartheid regime and increasingly, what many see as the failure of the current government to tackle social issues. However, the ANC's social housing policy has produced some improvement in living conditions in many areas. Politics                             The central area of  Pretoria , the administrative capital of South Africa.                          South Africa has a bicameral   Parliament, comprising the   National Council of Provinces (or upper house) with 90 members, and a   National Assembly (or lower house) with 400 members. Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by   proportional representation: half of the members are elected from national lists and half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the   President. Current South African politics is dominated by the   African National Congress (ANC), which received 69.7% of the vote during the   2004 general election. The main challenger to the ANC's rule is the   Democratic Alliance party, which received only 12.4% of the vote. The formerly dominant   New National Party, who introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the   National Party, has suffered increasing humiliation at election polls since 1994, and finally voted to disband on   9 April   2005. Provinces         When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent   Bantustans into the political structure of South Africa. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa (  Cape Province,   Natal,   Orange Free State, and   Transvaal) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are usually much smaller than the former provinces, which theoretically is in order to give local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas. The new provinces are:                                     Province           Former Homelands and Provinces           Capital           Area (km²)           Area (mi²)           Population (2001)                             Eastern Cape                       Cape Province,   Transkei,   Ciskei                       Bisho           169,580           65,475           6,436,761                                         Free State                       Orange Free State.

South Africa has a great variety of climate zones, from the extreme   desert of the   Kalahari near  Namibia  to lush   subtropical climate along the border with  Mozambique . It quickly rises over a   mountainous   escarpment towards the interior   plateau known as the   Highveld. Even though South Africa is classified as   semi-arid, there is considerable variation in  climate  as well as   topography. The interior of South Africa is a giant, mountainous, and sparsely populated   scrubland   Karoo plateau, which is drier towards the north-west along the Kalahari desert. In contrast, the eastern coastline is lush and well-watered which produces a climate similar to the tropics. The extreme south west has a climate remarkably similar to that of the   Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers. This area also produces much of South Africa's   wine. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the   Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many   shipwrecks. Further east on the country's south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the   Garden Route. The   Free State is particularly flat due to the fact that the eastern region of the Highveld does not extend as far north as the western region. North the   Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat.  Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740   metres (5,709   ft) and receives an annual rainfall of 760 millimetres (30   in). Winters in this region are cold, although  snow  is rare. To the north and east of Johannesburg, the altitude drops beyond the Highveld's escarpment, and turns into the   Lowveld. The Lowveld has particularly high temperatures, and is also the location of traditional South African   Bushveld. The high   Drakensberg mountains, which form the eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited   skiing opportunities in winter. The coldest place in South Africa is   Sutherland in the western   Roggeveld Mountains, where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as –15 degrees   Celsius (5 °  F). The deep interior has the hottest temperatures: A temperature of 51.7 °C (125 °F) was recorded in 1948 in the   Northern Cape Kalahari near   Upington.  [1] South Africa also has one possession, the small sub-antarctic archipelago of the   Prince Edward Islands, consisting of Marion Island (290 km²/112 mi²) and Prince Edward Island (45 km²/17.3 mi²; not to be confused with the   Canadian province of the same name). Flora and fauna                                        Fynbos, a   floral kingdom unique to South Africa, is found near  Cape Town .                          South Africa has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10% of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity. South Africa's most prevalent biome is   grassland, particularly on the   Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different   grasses, low   shrubs, and   acacia trees, mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn.  Vegetation  becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low   rainfall. There are several species of water-storing   succulents like   aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry   Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn   savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the northeast of the country, with more dense growth. There are significant numbers of   baobab trees in this area, near the northern end of   Kruger National Park.   [2] The   Fynbos   Biome, one of the six   floral kingdoms, is located in a small region of the   Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity. The majority of the plants are   evergreen hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like  leaves , such as the   sclerophyllous plants. Another uniquely South African plant is the   protea genus of flowering plants. There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa. While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the   humid   coastal plain along the  Indian Ocean  in   KwaZulu-Natal. There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of   fire, known as montane forests.   Plantations of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native   eucalyptus and   pine. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many e.g. Black Wattle, Port Jackson,   Hakea,   Lantana and   Jacaranda posing a significant threat to the native  biodiversity  and the already scarce water resources. The original   temperate forest that met the first European settlers to South Africa was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African   hardwood trees like   Real Yellowwood  (Podocarpus latifolius) ,   stinkwood  (Ocotea bullata) , and South African   Black Ironwood  (Olea laurifolia)  are under government protection. Wildlife         South Africa has many thousands of species of   Wildlife. The Kruger National Park is South Africa's largest game reserve and contains a checklist for the following (indigenous) mammals Aardvark ,   Aardwolf,  Antelope (Roan) ,   Antelope (Sable),   Baboon (Chacma),   Badger Honey,   Buffalo,   Bushbaby,  Bushbuck ,  Bushpig ,   Caracal,  Cat (African Wild) ,  Cheetah ,   Civet,   Dassie,   Dog Wild,   Duiker (Common and Red),   Eland,   Elephant (African),   Fox (Bat-earer Genet),  Giraffe ,   Grysbok Sharpe's,   Hartebeest,   Hyena (Spotted),  Hippopotamus ,  Jackal ,  Impala ,   Klipspringer,   Kudu,  Leopard ,  Lion ,  Mongoose (various) ,   Monkey (Samango),   Nyala,   Reedbuck,  Rhinoceros ,  Wildebeest ,   Waterbuck,  Warthog ,  Zebra Economy                                        Durban, a famous resort city on the  Indian Ocean  coast and site of Africa's largest commercial port.                                              The   Victoria & Alfred Waterfront in  Cape Town  with   Table Mountain in the background. Cape Town has become an important   retail and  tourism  centre for the country, and attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa.                          South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors, a  stock exchange  (the   JSE Securities Exchange), that ranks among the 10 largest in the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centres throughout the region. South Africa's per capita   GDP, corrected for   purchasing power parity, positions the country as one of the 50 wealthiest in the world. In many respects, South Africa is developed; however, this development is significantly localised around 4 areas, namely: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria-Johannesburg. Beyond these 4 economic centres, development is marginal and poverty still reigns despite Government strategies. Large income gaps and a   dual economy designate South Africa as developing. Only Brazil and India show a greater divide between its country's wealthy and poor residents. Consecutive growth rates in the last ten years are helping lower unemployment, however, the economy still has ways to go, and daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty and lack of   economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups. Other problems are crime, corruption, and HIV/AIDS. At the start of 2000, President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of privatisation, and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organised labour. It is estimated that South Africa accounts for up to 30% of the   gross domestic product of the entire African continent. South Africa is also the continent's largest energy producer and consumer. The   rand, the world's most actively traded emerging   market currency, has joined an elite club of 15 currencies - the   Continuous linked settlement (CLS) - where forex transactions are settled immediately, lowering the risks of transacting across   time zone. The South African Rand (ZAR) was the best performing currency against the US Dollar between 2002 and 2005, according to the   Bloomberg Currency Scorecard. The volatility of the   rand has affected economic activity, with the rand falling sharply during 2001, hitting an historic low of R13.85 to the   United States dollar, raising fears of inflation, and causing the Reserve Bank to increase   interest rates. The rand has since dramatically recovered, trading at R5.99 to the dollar as of January 2006 while the South African Reserve Bank's policy of inflation targeting has brought inflation under control. The stronger rand has however put exporters under considerable pressure, with many calling for government to intervene in the exchange rate to help soften the rand, and many others dismissing staff. 21.5% of the adult South African population have been estimated to be HIV positive in 2004. The government has recently, after much delay, devoted substantial resources to fighting the epidemic. A recent study from the African Journal of AIDS Research by Thomas Rehle and Olive Shisana showed the infection rate starting to level off, from 4.2% to 1.7% infection rate for 15-49 year olds, and AIDS deaths peaking at 487,320 in 2008. Refugees from poorer neighbouring countries abound with immigrants from the DRC, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi and many others representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels amongst poorer South Africans,   xenophobia is a very real fear and many people born in South Africa feel resentful of immigrants who are seen to be depriving the native population of jobs, a feeling which has been given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the   construction,  tourism ,  agriculture  and   domestic service industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading.   [3] However, many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the South African immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994   [4]. Agriculture                             Women agricultural workers, 1989                          South Africa has a large agricultural sector, and is a net exporter of farming products. There are almost a thousand   agricultural cooperatives and   agribusinesses throughout the country, and agricultural exports constitute eight per cent of South Africa's total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes to around 30% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing towards around 2.6% of   GDP for the nation. However, due to the aridity of the land, only 15% can be used for crop production.           [5] Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well developed, people in some rural areas still survive on   subsistence farming. It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,   citrus,   nectarines,   wine and   deciduous fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize , and it has been estimated that 9 million tons is produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.   Livestock are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85% of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4300 milk producers providing employment for 60 000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around 40 000 others. In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as   land reform and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticised both by farmers' groups and by landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough,   [6] and the former alleging racist treatment (many commercial farmers are white) and expressing concerns that a similar situation to   Robert Mugabe's land reform policy may develop, a fear exacerbated by comments made by the country's   deputy president   [7]. The sector continues to face problems with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. Crime against commercial farmers is often, although not always, racially motivated as many South African commercial farmers are white. The rural farmer population has shouldered a great increase in attacks and harassment and has suffered as many as 1,700   farm murders since the end of apartheid in 1994, and this has caused many commercial farmers, who are often white, to flee the countryside for the protection of the gated communities of the cities and that offered by other nations. The government has been accused of not devoting enough time and money to tackle the problem as opposed to other forms of violent crime, or simply inefficiency and incompetence. Another issue which continues to affect South African agriculture is environmental damage caused by misuse of the land. To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement, the government have supported a scheme which promotes   sustainable development and the use of natural resources.   [8] Demographics                  Main article:  Demographics of South Africa         South Africa is a nation of 44.8 million people of diverse origins,  cultures ,  languages , and   beliefs. The 2001   Statistics South Africa   census   [9] provided five   racial categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, ""unspecified/other"" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted. Results for the other categories were:                     Black—75%            White—14%            Coloured—9% Indian/Asian —3%         By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, but it is not culturally or linguistically homogenous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu ,   Xhosa,   Basotho (South Sotho),   Bapedi (North Sotho),   Venda,   Tswana,   Tsonga,   Swazi and   Ndebele. Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with South Africa's neighbours: The   Basotho group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The   Tswana ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The   Swazi ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The   Ndebele ethnic group is also found in   Matabeleland in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the   Matabele. These Ndebele people are however in effect Zulu people because the language they speak is Zulu and they are the descendants of the Warrior   Mzilikazi who escaped persecution from Shaka to settle in that part of the World. The   Tsonga ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan. The white population descends largely from colonial immigrants:  Dutch ,  German ,  French  Huguenot, and  British . Linguistically, it is divided into   Afrikaans- and  English -speaking groups, although many small communities immigrating over the last century retain the use of other languages. The white population is on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high crime rate and the government's   affirmative action policies. The term ""  Coloured"" is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous   Khoisan who lived in the   Cape at the time, indigenous African Blacks, Whites (mostly the   Dutch/  Afrikaner settlers and the English) as well as an admixture of   Javanese,   Malay,  Indian ,   Malagasy and other European and Asian blood (such as  Portuguese  and   Burmese). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar in that they were light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were effectively annihilated; the San, called  Bushmen  by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. Within what is known as the Coloured community, you will also find some more recent immigrants - Coloureds from the old   Rhodesia (now  Zimbabwe ) and  Namibia , as well as immigrants of mixed descent from  India  and   Burma (  Anglo-Indians/  Anglo-Burmese) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence. The major part of the   Asian population of the country is  Indian  in origin, many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the 19th century to work on the  sugar  plantations of the eastern coastal area then known as   Natal. There is also a significant group of   Chinese South Africans (approximately 100 000 individuals). Education         Education is in a state of flux. Under the apartheid system schools were segregated, and the quantity and quality of education varied significantly across racial groups. Although the laws governing this segregation have been abolished, the long and arduous process of restructuring the country's educational system is just beginning. The challenge is to create a single nondiscriminatory, nonracial system that offers the same standards of education to all people. Culture                                        Prison Buildings on   Robben Island, the holding place of several   anti-apartheid fighters including  Nelson Mandela , who was imprisoned there for 27 years. Robben Island is now a   UNESCO   World Heritage Site.                                              Decorated houses, Drakensberg Mountains                          It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures are enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to  food ,  music  and  dance  feature prominently.           South African cuisine is heavily   meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a   braai . South Africa has also developed into a major   wine producer, with some of the best   vineyards in the world lying in valleys around   Stellenbosch,   Franschoek,   Paarl and   Barrydale. There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed a unique style called   Kwaito. Of note is   Brenda Fassie, who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special"", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include   Ladysmith Black Mambazo, while the   Soweto String Quartet performs classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers tend to avoid traditional African musical themes, instead preferring more European musical styles. There is a thriving market for   Afrikaans music, covering all the   genres of Western music. The country's black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that traditional dance and music survive; as blacks have become increasingly   urbanised and  westernised , aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban blacks usually speak  English  or   Afrikaans in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of   Khoisan languages which are not official languages, but are one of the eight officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of   endangered languages, most of which are from the Khoi-San family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival. The white minority lead lifestyles similar in many respects to whites found in   Western Europe,   North America and  Australasia . Despite considerable discrimination under apartheid, Coloureds tend to relate more to white South African culture rather than black South African culture, especially   Afrikaans-speaking Coloured people whose  language  and   religious beliefs are similar or identical to white   Afrikaners. A small minority of Coloureds, known as   Cape Malays, are   Muslim.           Asians, predominantly of  Indian  origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages and religious beliefs, being either  Hindu  or   Sunni Muslim, and speaking English, with Indian languages like   Tamil or   Gujarati being spoken less frequently. Most Indians arrived on the famous   Truro ship as   indentured labourers in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields. There is a much smaller   Chinese community in South Africa, although its numbers have increased due to immigration from  Taiwan . Since the Taiwanese were classified as White, rather than Asian, under apartheid, they tend to be more culturally similar to whites in many ways than they are to other Asians. Languages         South Africa has 11   official languages:  English ,   Afrikaans,   Zulu,   Swati,   Ndebele,   Southern Sotho,   Northern Sotho,   Tsonga,   Tswana,   Venda and   Xhosa. In this regard it is   second only to India in number. As a result, there are many official names for the country. The country also recognises eight non-official languages:   Fanagalo,   Lobedu,   Northern Ndebele,   Phuthi,   South African Sign Language,   Khoe,   Nama and   San. These non-official languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition. Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the  San  and  Khoikhoi  people contain regional   dialects stretching northward into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their  hunter-gatherer  societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming   extinct. Many white South Africans also speak other  European  languages, such as   Portuguese,   German, and   Greek, while many   Asians and  Indians  in South Africa speak   South Asian languages, such as   Hindi,   Gujarati and   Tamil. There are   11 official names for South Africa, one for each of the official national languages. While each language is technically equal to every other, English has emerged recently as the chief-among-peers as it is the most widely spoken language across racial barriers as well as globally, even though it is not the most widely spoken language by population. Afrikaans has been downgraded in order to accommodate other official languages. The South African passport currently has only French and English on the front cover and lists the other official names of South Africa on an inner page. Crime         Crime has been a major problem in South Africa since the end of the Apartheid. According to a   survey for the period 1998 - 2000 compiled by the  United Nations , South Africa was ranked first for   murder by   firearm (both absolute and per capita) and   rape per capita. It was also number two for   assault and murder (by all means) per capita. On the positive side, total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set. Nevertheless, crime has had a pronounced effect on society: many wealthier South Africans moved into   gated communities, abandoning the central business districts of some cities for the relative security of suburbs. This effect is most pronounced in Johannesburg, although the trend is noticeable in other cities as well. Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave. Crime against commercial   farmers has continued to be a major problem in the country, and has resulted in thousands either emigrating or giving up the profession. South Africa also has a bad record for   car hijackings. However, violent crimes such as   murder and   robberies have decreased in recent years, with the year 2004 seeing a drop of 4.6% and 5.3% respectively for these two offences. The rape rate, however, showed no signs of such a slowdown.   [10] Recently the government has had a widely-publicised   gun   amnesty programme to recall the many weapons still in circulation from the apartheid era violence and wars in neighbouring countries like  Mozambique . In addition, it adopted the   National Crime Prevention Strategy in 1996, which aimed to prevent crime through reinforcing community structures and helping individuals back into work.   [11] The government is criticised for doing too little to stop crime. Some question the effectiveness of the South African Police Service, which is known to make use of private security firms to protect its police stations. It must be pointed out, however, that due to the high crime rate in South Africa, many private individuals also make use of these systems. Military         South Africa's   armed forces, known as the  South African National Defence Force (SANDF) , was created in 1994 following South Africa's first post-apartheid national elections and the adoption of a new constitution. Previously known simply as the  South African Defence Force (SADF) , the new force consists of the old SADF,   Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK),   APLA and the TBVC state's defence forces. The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, namely:          The   South African Army The   South African Air Force The   South African Navy The   South African Military Health Services         In recent years the SANDF has become a major stabilising force in Africa, involved in peacekeeping operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo  and  Burundi  amongst others, and participating as part of multi-national  UN  peacekeeping forces. South Africa spent an estimated US$3.172bn (or 1.5% of GDP) in 2004, according to the   CIA World Factbook, placing the country 108th in the world in military spending as percentage of GDP. According to   Nation Master, an Internet based statistics site, the SANDF had roughly 73,440 personnel in 2001, distributed as follows:          Army - 54,300 Air force - 11,140 Navy - 8,000         Though the numbers are bound to be inaccurate as they come from a variety of sources and do not account for medical personnel. South Africa is the only country ever to develop nuclear weapons and then give them up. See   South Africa and weapons of mass destruction. Media         South Africa also has a large, free, and active press that regularly challenges the government, a habit formed during the apartheid era when the press was the media least controlled by the government. Major   scandals have erupted when the press reported charges of   corruption that were proven to be true in cases such as that of   Schabir Shaik, in which deputy president   Jacob Zuma was implicated, and the corruption allegations that led to the dismissal of   Winnie Mandela from parliament. The government's stance on the   2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections and  AIDS  have also attracted plenty of coverage. Even though South Africa now has the most sophisticated media network in Africa, it was one of the last countries in the world to allow   television, with colour TV broadcasts commencing in 1975. By the end of   apartheid in 1994, television networks covered all   urban areas and some less populated areas, while radio networks covered almost all of the country. During the Apartheid era the majority of commercial and all public-service radio stations and all of the television channels were operated by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), and were subject to strict control and censorship by the government, with a few independent regional stations allowed. The creation of the independent black homelands (or Bantustans) in the 1970's allowed for the establishment of TV and radio stations outside of the control of the apartheid Government. Following the demise of Apartheid, the broadcasting industry was de-regulated with many of the commercial regional SABC stations and former Bantustan stations privatised and sold to companies and consortiums that were majority owned by blacks. An African language channel was introduced to the   SABC in 1981 with a second African language channel added later in the decade. The SABC's television monopoly was eventually challenged in 1986 when a new privately owned subscription television network,   M-Net, was launched. M-Net was forbidden to operate a news service. South Africa currently has two terrestrial free-to-air television networks (SABC and   e.tv), one subscription based terrestrial network (M-Net), as well as has access to satellite television (  DStv) which is operated by M-Net's owners, Multichoice. e. TV is allowed to operate an independent television news service. The SABC broadcasts news and entertainment channels Africa-wide via satellite.

Racially discriminative and  segregationist  principles were not novelties to the country. Since unionisation in 1910, the state had stood only for the white minority and pursued segregation. Apartheid was a certified, lawful and inflexible type of separation that was methodically entrenched through a battery of legislation. As it was not completely new to the country, and because many Western countries still exercised their own forms of prejudice in their assorted colonies, there was minimal rejoinder and indignation. Another issue, apparently graver, dwelled in the most prominent part of the Western world's (and, together with it, the UN's) agenda. The conclusion of the Second World War signified the commencement of the Cold War, and South Africa, with its anti-red stance, was considered a possible assistant in the passive battle against the Soviet Union.   The world did not, however, condone South Africa's discriminatory policies. At the first UN gathering in 1946, South Africa was placed on the programme. The primary subject in question was the handling of South African Indians, a great cause of divergence between South Africa and India. In 1952, apartheid was thrashed out again in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign. The UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although racial variance in South Africa was a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was one of South Africa's in-house issues, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction. The UN only became resolute in challenging South Africa later.     [ edit ]   South-West Africa       Main article:  Namibia under South African occupation                 This section does not  cite  any  references or sources .   Please help  improve this section  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2008)       The apartheid issue aside, there was also a major quarrel between the UN and South Africa about the management of  South West Africa . After  World War I , all German colonies were made mandates of the  League of Nations , the  UN's  forbearer. Direction of these mandates was allotted to certain countries. The  Treaty of Versailles  declared German West Africa a  League of Nations Mandate  under South African administration, and it then became known as South West Africa. Walvis Bay was annexed by Britain in 1878 and incorporated into the Cape Colony in 1884. [ 1 ]  It thus became part of the Union of South Africa in 1910. In 1915 the Union occupied German South West Africa at the request of the Allied powers. South Africa was granted a ""C"" Class mandate by the League of Nations to administer SWA as an integral part of South Africa. The South African government transferred administration of Walvis Bay to SWA in 1922 and then transferred it back to the Cape Province again in 1977. After the configuration of the UN in 1945, and the transferral of mandates from the League of Nations to the new body, the arrangement changed: former obligatory powers (vis--vis those in charge of ex-German colonies) were now obliged to form new concurrences with the UN over their management of the mandates. South Africa, however, refused to play ball, declining to allow the territory to move towards independence. The NP government argued that, for a quarter of a century, South-West Africa had been directed as a piece of South Africa, and the preponderance of South-West Africans wanted to become South Africans anyway. Instead, South-West Africa was treated as a  de facto  ""fifth province"" of the Union. The South African government turned this mandate arrangement into a military occupation, and extended apartheid to South-West Africa.   The UN attempted to compel South Africa to let go of the mandate, and, in 1960,  Liberia  and  Ethiopia  requested that the  International Court of Justice  announce that South Africa's management of South West Africa was illegitimate. They argued that South Africa was bringing apartheid to South-West Africa, too. South Africa was formally accused of maladministration, and the lawsuit, commencing in November 1960, lasted almost six years. The International Court's verdict astonished the UN: it ruled that Liberia and Ethiopia had no right to take issue with South Africa's deeds in South-West Africa. The Court did not, however, pass judgement on whether or not South Africa still had a mandate over the region. The UN declared that the mandate was indeed concluded, and a council of the UN was to run the state until its independence in 1968. South Africa rebuffed the resolution, but declared its ostensible intention to ready South-West Africa for independence.   Anxiety increased when the UN Council for South-West Africa was declined admission, and steepened still further when South Africa indicted 35 South-West Africans and then found them guilty of terror campaigns. The UN reproached South Africa and declared that South-West Africa would thenceforth be known as  Namibia . At the  New York Accords  in 1988, South Africa finally signed the agreement that granted the country its independence.     [ edit ]   Sharpeville and the severing of British ties   South Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when  British Prime Minister   Harold Macmillan  criticised them during his celebrated  Wind of Change speech  in  Cape Town . Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the  Sharpeville Massacre , resulting in more international condemnation. Soon thereafter, Verwoerd announced a  referendum  on whether the country should sever links with the  British monarchy  and become a  republic  instead. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for whites to eighteen and included whites in  South West Africa  on the voter's roll. The referendum on  5 October  that year asked whites, ""Do you support a republic for the Union?"", and 52 per cent voted ""Yes"".   As a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the  Commonwealth , with which it had privileged trade links. Even though  India  became a  republic within the Commonwealth  in 1947 it became clear that  African  and  Asian  member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on  31 May   1961 , the day that the Republic came into existence.   In 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed. The Sharpeville massacre had jolted the global neighbourhood, with the apartheid regime showing that it would use violent behaviour to repress opposition to racial inequity. Many Western states began to see apartheid as a possible danger to global harmony, as the policy caused much intercontinental abrasion over human-rights violation.   In April 1960, the Security Council of the UN settled for the first time on concerted action against the apartheid regime, demanding that the NP bring an end to racial separation and discrimination; but, instead, the South African administration merely employed further suppressive instruments. The ANC and PAC were forbidden from continued existence, and political assemblies were prohibited. From then on, the UN placed the South African issue high on its list of priorities.   In 1961, UN Secretary-General  Dag Hammarskjld  stopped over in South Africa and subsequently stated that he had been powerless to effect a concurrence Prime Minister Verwoerd. That same year, Verwoerd proclaimed South Africa's extraction from the Commonwealth as a result of its censure of his government.     [ edit ]   Sanctions   On  6 November   1962 , the  United Nations General Assembly  passed  Resolution 1761 , condemning South African apartheid policies. On  7 August   1963  the  United Nations Security Council  passed  Resolution 181  calling for a voluntary  arms embargo  against South Africa, and that very year, a Special Committee Against Apartheid was established to encourage and oversee plans of action against the regime.   In 1966, the United Nations held the first (of many) colloquiums on apartheid. The General Assembly announced 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in memory of the Sharpeville bloodbath. In 1971, the UN General Assembly formally denounced the institution of homelands, and a motion was passed in 1974 to eject South Africa from the UN, but this was discarded by France, Britain and the United States of America, all of them key trade associates of South Africa.   One probable type of action against South Africa was economic sanction. If UN affiliates broke fiscal and trading links with the country, it would make it all the trickier for the apartheid government to uphold itself and its policies. Such sanctions were argued frequently within the UN, and many recognised and backed it as an effectual and non-violent way of applying force, but South Africa's major trading partners once more voted against mandatory sanctions. In 1962, the UN General Assembly requested that its members split political, fiscal and transportation connections with South Africa. In 1968, it suggested the deferral of all cultural, didactic and sporting commerce as well. From 1964, the US and Britain discontinued their dealings of armaments to South Africa. In spite of the many cries for sanctions, however, none were made obligatory, because South Africa's main trading partners were again primarily concerned for their own financial security.   In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 .     [ edit ]   Aid to apartheid casualties   Another way in which the UN could do something to combat apartheid was to lend support and aid to its victims. In 1963, the General Assembly passed a decree requesting that members contribute financially towards assisting apartheid sufferers. Many states [ who? ]  took note of the call and carried out the necessary action.     [ edit ]   Lusaka Manifesto             This section does not  cite  any  references or sources .   Please help  improve this section  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2008)       The  Organisation for African Unity  (OAU) was created in 1963. Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa. It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa. African states swore to aid the freedom movements in their fights against apartheid. In April 1969, fourteen autonomous nations from Central and East Africa gathered in  Lusaka ,  Zambia , to argue about various African matters. The assembly formulated the 'Lusaka Manifesto', which was signed on  13 April  by all of the countries in attendance, except for  Malawi . This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations.   The Lusaka Manifesto summarised the political situations of self-governing African countries, snubbing racism and inequity, and calling for black majority rule in all African nations. It did not rebuff South Africa entirely, though, adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government, and even recognising its autonomy. Although African principals desired the emancipation of black South Africans, they trusted in their abilities to attain this in peaceable ways, intercession instead of militancy. The manifesto's signatories did not want to engage in a military war by supporting the liberation pugilists, because, for one thing, they could ill afford it and, for another, they dreaded retaliation. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Morogoro Conference   Neither the ANC nor the PAC was content with the Lusaka Manifesto. The signatories had not checked with them before laying out the document, and they foresaw the fact that African backing for the struggle would taper. The Manifesto did not truly recognise the significance of the liberation groups in the answer to South Africa's problems and even proposed dissuading them from an armed struggle. Both the ANC and the PAC had started using violent means in the 1960s, with the formation of their military wings.   Disinclined to destroy the support that they did have, however, the ANC and PAC did not explicitly condemn the Manifesto. In 1969, though, the ANC held the inaugural National Consultative Conference in  Morogoro [,  Tanzania , where it ironed out its troubles and anxieties. The result was a decision not to end the armed struggle but, rather, to advance it. Oliver Tambo summed up thus: ""Close Ranks! This is the order to our people, our youth, the army, to each Umkhonto we Sizwe militant, to all our many supporters the world over. This is the order to our leaders, to all of us. The order that comes from this conference is 'Close Ranks and Intensify the Armed Struggle!'""   Unlike the independence factions, the South African administration hailed the Lusaka Manifesto's plans for arbitration and dtente. This tied in nicely with Prime Minister Vorster's own plan for the reduction of South Africa's seclusion from the rest of the world. He called his ""Outward looking"" policy. The state also maintained that the preservation of separate development through homelands carried out the Manifesto's insistence on human equality and dignity. The homelands, it argued, were meant eventually to be self-governing, decolonised nations where black people could take part in ballots and be free to live how they wished.   That is not to say that the NP government  agreed  to the Lusaka Manifesto, however. It rejected the manifesto's backing of liberation movements, in spite of the fact that the movements themselves felt the Manifesto was showing a  lack  of support.     [ edit ]   Mogadishu Declaration   South Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to her policies brought about another OAU announcement in 1971. The Mogadishu Declaration declared that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that her black people could only be freed through fighting, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government. Henceforth, it would be up to South Africa to keep contact with other African states.     [ edit ]   Outward-Looking Policy   In 1966, BJ Vorster was made South African Prime Minister. He was not about to eliminate apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's seclusion and the purported larger mentality. He wanted to perk up the country's global reputation and overseas dealings, even those with black-ruled nations in Africa. This he called his ""Outward-Looking"" policy: South Africa would look outwards, towards the global neighbourhood, rather than adopting a siege mentality and estranging it. The buzzwords for his strategy were ""dialogue"" and ""dtente"", signifying arbitration and reduction of pressure.     [ edit ]   Effect of the Soweto Uprising   Following the  Soweto Uprising  in 1976 and its brutal suppression by the apartheid regime, the arms embargo was made mandatory by the UN Security Council on  4 November   1977  and South Africa became increasingly isolated internationally, with tough economic sanctions weighing heavily. Not all countries imposed or fully supported the sanctions, however; instead, they continued to benefit from trade with apartheid South Africa. During the 1980s, though, the number of countries opposing South Africa increased, and the economy came under tremendous strain.     [ edit ]   Other African states   Vorster's attitude towards other African countries was not so much a modification of strategy as a continuance of Verwoerd's approach. Vorster's forerunner had already become aware of the fact that cordial dealings with as many black states as possible was of paramount importance. As more and more African states acquired freedom from their colonial dictatorships, bitterness towards a repressively racialist South Africa increased. If South Africa did not wish to become completely cut off from the rest of the African continent, she had to sustain gracious associations with it, starting, of course, with mutual economic support. Vorster persisted with this strategy and built good relationships with a number of independent African states.   In 1967, Vorster proffered technological and fiscal counsel gratis to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that absolutely no political strings were attached. He gave great attention to financial facets, aware of the fact that many African states were very run-down and would require financial aid in spite of their rebuffing of South Africa's racial principles.  Malawi  and  Lesotho  were the first countries to enter discussions with the NP government.  Angola  and  Mozambique  soon followed.   One of the first steps to take in initiating dealings was to convene with the heads of these African countries. Here Vorster worked decidedly contrary to Verwoerd's policies. Where Verwoerd had declined to get together and engage in dialogue with such leaders as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of  Nigeria  in 1962 and  Kenneth Kaunda  of  Zambia  in 1964, Vorster, in 1966, met with the heads of the states of Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. There was still mutual suspiciousness, however, particularly after Vorster's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto in 1969. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland stayed candid critics of apartheid, but they hinged on South Africa's economic aid. This was inclusive of pecuniary credit and the fact that many natives from these states worked the South African mines.   Malawi was the first country not on South African borders to accept South African aid. She identified the monetary benefits of such a deal, for there were also many Malawians working in South African mines. In 1967, the two states delineated their political and economic relations, and, in 1969, Malawi became the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto. In 1970, Malawian President Hastings Banda made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa.   Associations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were  Liberia ,  the Ivory Coast ,  Madagascar ,  Mauritius ,  Gabon ,  Zaire  (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo),  Ghana  and the  Central African Republic . These African states slammed apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), but fiscal reliance on South Africa, together with fear of her armed potency, resulted in their forming the aforementioned ties.     [ edit ]   Western ties   The ""Outward Looking"" principle had a significant consequence for South Africa's relationships with Western nations. When Vorster brought forth his strategy, it appeared to them that South Africa might be loosening her racist grip. At the same time, the West regarded the apartheid administration as a significant friend in the  Cold War  of ideologies. Economically, such nations as Britain and America had numerous concerns in South Africa, and, although they did not endorse apartheid, these concerns led them to a more moderate stance on the country and to vote against financial sanctions against her at UN conferences.     [ edit ]   Britain   When South Africa pulled out of the  Commonwealth  in 1961, some members [ who? ]  felt that the only way to sort her out was to enforce monetary  sanctions  and forbid the sale of armaments to her. Other members, most notably Britain, resisted this. She had many key trade links and, in particular, needed South Africa's  gold .   There were also tactical motives for not severing all ties with the apartheid government. As the southernmost nation in Africa, and the juncture at which the Indian and Atlantic Oceans collided, South Africa was still a vital point in sea-trade routes. In 1969, the Commandant General of the  South African Defence Force  (SADF) confirmed that, ""[i]n the entire ocean expanse from Australia to South America, South Africa is the only fixed point offering modern naval bases, harbours and airfield facilities, a modern developed industry and stable government."" [ cite this quote ]  South Africa was also a pivotal partner to the West in the years of the  Cold War . If the West ever required martial, maritime or air-force services on the African continent, it would have to rely on South Africa's assistance.   From 1960 to 1961, the relationship between South Africa and Britain started to change. In his "" Winds of Change "" speech in  Cape Town ,  Harold Macmillan  spoke of the changes in Africa and how South Africa's racist policies were swimming upstream. Even as more countries added to the call for sanctions, Britain remained unwilling to sever her ties with the apartheid administration. Possible reasons were her copious assets in the state, an unwillingness to hazard turbulence brought on by intercontinental meddling, and the fact that many British people had kith and kin living in South Africa or, indeed, were living there themselves. Along with America, Britain would persistently vote against certain sanctions against South Africa.   South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth in 1994.     [ edit ]   USA   At the outset of apartheid, the  United States  avoided serious criticism of South Africa's racial policies. Following the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, however, the country voted at the UN conference against it. The US impressed a severe armament embargo on South Africa from 1964, and, from 1967, the American navy avoided the South African harbours. Unlike Britain, the USA did not see much importance in the Cape route, but they did see the economic opportunities for South African investment. Imports and exports between the two nations came to many millions of dollars. Financial ties aside, there were also numerous cultural links between South Africa and America. South Africans of all creeds were given the chance to study in America with scholarships. The US even utilised South Africa for her exploration of outer space, setting up a satellite tracking post near  Krugersdorp , and building numerous telescopes for lunar probes. This picked up ailing ties between the two countries, but, in the 1970s, America withdrew from the tracking station.   As fiscal ties between South Africa, America and Britain were reinforced, however, sporting and cultural boycotts became important gadgets in South Africa's isolation from international society. The arms prohibition obliged South Africa to look elsewhere (particularly France) for its artillery, build up its own technology and manufacture weapons itself. At first, the Cold War had little influence on the connection between the West and South Africa: America believed that the armament embargo would not put up a barrier between them. If a major quarrel broke out in Africa, South Africa would be forced to work with America anyway.     [ edit ]   Isolation   One of the primary means for the international community to show its aversion to apartheid was to  boycott  South Africa in a variety of spheres of multinational life. Economic and military sanctions were among these, but cultural and sporting boycotts also found their way in. South Africa, in this way, was cut off from the rest of the globe. It also awoke the South African community to the opinions of other countries. Despite financial shunning causing significant harm to black South Africans, the ANC proclaimed it as an essential means of achieving liberty. Cultural and sporting boycotts, on the other hand, did not have a negative effect on the lives of  blacks , as they were already barred from these by their own government. Not being able to partake in global sporting and cultural affairs was most trying to the whites, however, who thought themselves equal to the best in the world.   Sporting seclusion commenced in the mid-1950s and increased through the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the  International Table Tennis Federation  severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board in its stead. The apartheid government came back by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games. Other global sports unions followed the example, but they were sluggish in doing so.   In 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was shaped to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with white establishments, SASA went to the  International Olympic Committee  (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's eviction form the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, she would be barred from the 1964. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the  1964 Games in Tokyo . South Africa selected a multi-racial side for the next Games, and the IOC opted to incorporate her in the  1968 Games in Mexico . Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation.   Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960,  Verwoerd  barred a  Mori   rugby  player from touring South Africa with the  All Blacks , and the tour was cancelled.  New Zealand  made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again. [ citation needed ]   B. J. Vorster  took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit  Basil D'Oliveira , a  Coloured  South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, ""Dolly"" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.   As sporting segregation persisted, it became obvious that that South Africa would have to make further changes to its sporting policies if it was to be recognised on the international stage. More and more careers were impinged upon by segregation, and they began to stand up against apartheid. In 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations.   International censure of segregated sport and calls for sporting sanctions persisted. The UN would continue to hold them against South Africa until the end of apartheid. These measures did not bring an end to international sport for South African teams, but they add very much to the country's seclusion. The bans were revoked in 1993, when conciliations for a democratic South Africa were well under way.   In the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for  cultural  boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor  Marlon Brando  called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the  Writers' Guild of Great Britain  called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in Britain and America was also vetoed. After the arrival of  television  in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union,  Equity , boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions, but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid.   These facets of social remoteness from the worldwide hamlet made apartheid a discomfiture and were most trying for sports and culture fans. These boycotts effectively egged on little changes to apartheid policy, and corroded white South Africans' dedication to it.   Numerous conferences were held and the  United Nations  passed  resolutions  condemning South Africa, including the  World Conference Against Racism  in 1978 and 1983. A significant  divestment movement  started, pressuring investors to refuse to invest in South African companies or companies that did business with South Africa. South African sports teams were barred from participation in international events, and South African culture and tourism were  boycotted .   Countries such as Zambia, Tanzania and the Soviet Union provided military support for the ANC and PAC. It was more difficult, though, for neighbouring states such as Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, because they were economically dependent on South Africa. Still, they did feed the struggle underground.   Ordinary people in foreign countries did much in protest against the apartheid government, too. The British Anti-Apartheid Movement was one of these, organising boycotts against South African sports teams, South African products such as wine and fruit, and British companies that dared trade with or in South Africa. Other organisations were formed to prevent musicians and the like from coming into the country, and others raised funds for the ANC and PAC.   After much debate, by the late 1980s the  United States , the  United Kingdom , and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. [ 2 ]  A  divestment  movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks. [ 3 ]   In an analysis of the effect of sanctions on South Africa by the  FW de Klerk Foundation , it was argued that they were not a leading contributor to the political reforms leading to the end of Apartheid. [ 4 ]  The analysis concluded that in many instances sanctions undermined effective reform forces, such as the changing economic and social order within South Africa. Furthermore, it was argued that forces encouraging economic growth and development resulted in a more international and liberal outlook amongst South Africans, and were far more powerful agents of reform than sanctions.     [ edit ]   Western influence   While international opposition to apartheid grew, the  Nordic countries  in particular provided both moral and financial support for the ANC. [ citation needed ]  On  21 February   1986   a week before he was murdered   Sweden 's prime minister  Olof Palme  made the  keynote  address to the  Swedish People's Parliament Against Apartheid  held in  Stockholm . In addressing the hundreds of anti-apartheid sympathizers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the  Anti-Apartheid Movement  such as  Oliver Tambo , Palme declared:     ""Apartheid cannot be reformed; it has to be eliminated."" [ cite this quote ]     Other Western countries adopted a more ambivalent position. In the 1980s, both the  Reagan  and  Thatcher  administrations in the USA and UK followed a ' constructive engagement ' policy with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions on South Africa, as they both fiercely believed in free trade, saw South Africa as a bastion against  Marxist  forces in Southern Africa, and approved of the apartheid policy anyway. Thatcher declared the ANC a terrorist organisation, [ 5 ] , and in 1987 her spokesman,  Bernard Ingham , famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was ""living in cloud cuckoo land"". [ 6 ]   By the late 1980s, however, with the tide of the  Cold War  turning and no sign of a political resolution in South Africa, Western patience with the apartheid government began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan  Republican / Democratic  initiative in the US favoured  economic sanctions  (realized as the  Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act ), the release of  Nelson Mandela  and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC. Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle. [ 7 ]   Some might argue [ who? ]  that Britain's significant economic involvement in South Africa provided some  leverage  with the South Africa government, with both the UK and the US applying pressure on the government, and pushing for negotiations. However, neither Britain nor the US were willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa, such as the mining company  Anglo American . A high-profile case claiming compensation from these companies was thrown out of court in 2004. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Border War       Main article:  South African Border War       By 1966,  SWAPO  launched guerilla raids from neighbouring countries against South Africa's occupation of  South-West Africa / Namibia . Initially South Africa fought a counter-insurgency war against SWAPO. But this conflict deepened after  Angola  gained its independence in 1975 under  Communist  leadership, the  MPLA , and  South Africa  promptly challenged them, allying with the Angolan rival party,  UNITA . By the end of the 1970s,  Cuba  had joined the fray, in one of several late  Cold War  flashpoints throughout  Southern Africa . [ 9 ]  This developed into a conventional war between South Africa and UNITA on one side against the Angolan government, the Cubans, the Soviets and SWAPO on the other side.     [ edit ]   Total onslaught   By 1980, as international opinion turned decisively against the apartheid regime, the government and much of the white population increasingly looked upon the country as a  bastion  besieged by  communism  and radical black nationalists. Considerable effort was put into circumventing  sanctions , and the government even went so far as to develop  nuclear weapons , allegedly with the help of  Israel . [ 10 ]  South Africa is the only country to date to have developed and voluntarily relinquished a nuclear arsenal.   Negotiating majority rule with the ANC was not considered an option (at least publicly), and it left the government to defend the country against external and internal threats through sheer military might. A siege mentality developed among whites, and, although many believed that a  civil war  against the black majority could not possibly be won, they preferred this to ""giving in"" to political reform. Brutal police and military actions seemed entirely justifiable. Paradoxically, the international sanctions that cut whites off from the rest of the world enabled black leaders to develop sophisticated political skills as those in exile forged ties with both regional and world leaders.   P. W. Botha initiated a policy of ""Total Onslaught, Total Strategy"", whereby reform was mixed with repression. With big businesses (affected by apartheid policies) ardently desirous of change, the government established two important commissions of enquiry. The Riekert Commission concluded that blacks ought to be allowed to buy their own homes in urban areas, while the Wiehahn Commission dictated that black trade unions be given more freedom, more money be spent on black education and some apartheid legislation be abolished. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act most certainly was, while the pass laws and employment colour bar were relaxed. Fewer people were arrested for offences pertaining to the latter as segregation in everyday life was gradually lessened. The government also gave so-called ""independence"" to a number of the homelands, but this seems to have been in part due to the fact that, as foreign citizens, their people could no longer expect anything from the South African government. Indeed, none of these reforms lessened the power of the white minority.   The term "" front-line states "" referred to countries in  Southern Africa  geographically near South Africa. Although these front-line states were all opposed to apartheid, many were economically dependent on South Africa. In 1980, they formed the  Southern African Development Coordination Conference  (SADCC), the aim of which was to promote economic development in the region and hence reduce dependence on South Africa. Furthermore, many SADCC members also allowed the exiled ANC and  PAC  to establish bases in their countries.   Other African countries also contributed to the fall of apartheid. In  1978 ,  Nigeria   boycotted  the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977  Gleneagles Agreement . Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the  1986 Commonwealth Games  because of British prime minister  Margaret Thatcher 's ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight. [ 11 ]   A number of African countries [ who? ]  contributed to the ANC's guerilla-insurgency campaign within South Africa. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Cross-border raids   South Africa had a policy to attack terrorist bases in neighbouring countries. These attacks were mainly aimed at ANC, PAC and SWAPO guerrilla-bases and safe houses in retaliation for acts of terror - like bomb explosions, massacres and guerrilla actions (like sabotage) by ANC, PAC and Swapo guerrillas in South Africa and Namibia. The country also aided organisations in surrounding countries who were actively combatting the spread of communism in Southern Africa. The results of these policies included:     Support for anti-government guerrilla groups  such as  UNITA  in  Angola  and  RENAMO  in  Mozambique   South African Defence Force  (SADF; now the  South African National Defence Force ; SANDF) hit-squad raids into front-line states. Bombing raids were also conducted into neighbouring states.   A full-scale invasion of Angola:  this was partly in support of UNITA, but was also an attempt to strike at  SWAPO  bases.   Targeting of exiled ANC leaders abroad:  Joe Slovo's wife  Ruth First  was killed by a parcel bomb in Maputo, and 'death squads' of the  Civil Co-operation Bureau  and the Directorate of Military Intelligence attempted to carry out assassinations on ANC targets in  Brussels ,  Paris  and Stockholm, as well as burglaries and bombings in  London .     In 1984, Mozambican president  Samora Machel  signed the  Nkomati Accord  with South Africa's president  P.W. Botha , in an attempt to rebuild Mozambique's economy. South Africa agreed to cease supporting anti-government forces, while the MK was prohibited from operating in Mozambique. This was an awful setback for the ANC.   In 1986 President Machel himself was killed in  an air crash  in mountainous terrain near the South African border after returning from a meeting in Zambia. South Africa was accused of continuing its aid to RENAMO and having caused the crash using a new advanced electronic beacon capable of luring aircraft into crashing. This was never proven and is still a subject of great controversy. The  South African Margo Commission  found that the crash was an accident while a Soviet delegation issued a  minority report  implicating South Africa. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Israel       Main article:  Israel-South Africa relations       Relations between Israel and the Union of South Africa were established as early as 1948, the Nationalist Prime Minister  Daniel Franois Malan  paying a visit to Israel and ""forgetting"" about the clearly antisemitic profile his own party's earned during the 1930s and by its opposition to joining in the Anti-Hitlerite coalition in World War II. After the  Sharpeville massacre  of 1960, Israel became one of the loudest critics of South African apartheid regime, which, along with Israel's intensive cooperation with the newly independent Sub-Saharan states, brought about a break in relations with  Pretoria . After 1967, however, and particularly in the 1970s, Israel became Pretoria's strategic partner. Israel joined the West only in the late 1980s in boycotting South Africa before the collapse of apartheid. Relations between modern-day Israel and South Africa are increasingly warm.     [ edit ]   End of Apartheid   In 1990, as part of the reformist policies undertaken by president  F.W. de Klerk  in South Africa, Namibia was granted independence, with the exception of the  enclave  of  Walvis Bay , which was reintegrated into Namibia in March 1994. After South Africa held its first multiracial election in April 1994, most sanctions imposed by the international community in opposition to the system of apartheid were lifted. On  June 1 ,  1994 , South Africa rejoined the  Commonwealth of Nations , and on  June 23 ,  1994 , it was readmitted to the  UN General Assembly . South Africa also joined the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU), now known as the  African Union ; the change from the OAU to the Union was initiated by  South African President   Thabo Mbeki  in 2002.

It is variously designated as geographically located within  Central Asia , [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   South Asia , [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  and the  Middle East . [ 9 ]  It is bordered by  Pakistan  in the south and east,  Iran  in the south and west,  Turkmenistan ,  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  in the north, and  China  in the far northeast. The name  Afghanistan  means the  Land of  Afghans .   Afghanistan is a crossroads between the  East  and the  West , and has been an ancient focal point of  trade  and  migration . It has an important  geostrategical  location, connecting South and Central Asia and Middle East. During its long history, the land has seen various invaders and conquerors, while on the other hand, local entities invaded the surrounding vast regions to form their own empires.  Ahmad Shah Durrani  created the  Durrani Empire  in 1747, which is considered the beginning of modern Afghanistan. [ 10 ]  Subsequently, the capital was shifted to  Kabul  and most of its territories ceded to former neighboring countries. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a  buffer state  in "" The Great Game "" played between the  British Indian Empire  and  Russian Empire . [ 11 ]  On August 19, 1919, following the  third Anglo-Afghan war , the country regained full independence from the United Kingdom over its  foreign affairs .   Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous and brutal  civil war  in addition to foreign interventions in the form of the 1979  Soviet invasion  and the recent 2001  U.S.-led invasion  that toppled the  Taliban  government. In late 2001 the  United Nations Security Council  authorized the creation of an  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) . This force is composed of  NATO  troops that are involved in assisting the government of President  Hamid Karzai  in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key  infrastructures  in the nation. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion  US dollars  have also been provided by the international community for the  reconstruction  of the country.

Its modern usage derives from the word  Afghan .     Origin of the name   The first part of the name, ""Afghan"", is an alternative name for the  Pashtuns  who are the founders and the largest ethnic group of the country. They probably began using the term  Afghan  as a name for themselves since at least the  Islamic  period and onwards. According to W. K. Frazier Tyler, M. C. Gillet and several other scholars,  ""The word Afghan first appears in history in the  udd al-lam  in 982 AD.""   Al-Biruni  referred to Afghans as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the  Indus River , which would be the  Sulaiman Mountains . [ 12 ]   A  Moroccan  traveller,  Ibn Battuta , visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: [ 13 ]       We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of  Persians  called Afghans.       In this regard the  Encyclopdia Iranica  states: [ 14 ]       From a more limited, ethnological point of view, ""Af gh n"" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Pat-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Patn. The equation [of]  Afghan  [and]  Patn  has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Patn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically.       It further explains:       The term ""Af gh n"" has probably designated the Patn since ancient times. Under the form  Avagn , this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer  Varha Mihira  in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his  Brihat-samhita .       This information is supported by traditional  Pashto literature , for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet  Khushal Khan Khattak : [ 15 ]       Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!       The last part of the name,  -stn  is an ancient  Indo-Iranian  suffix for ""place"", prominent in many languages of the region.   The term "" Afghanistan ,"" meaning the "" Land of Afghans ,"" was mentioned by the sixteenth century  Mughal Emperor  Babur in his  memoirs , referring to the territories south of  Kabul  that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called  ""Afghans""  by Babur). [ 16 ]   Until the 19th century the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the  Kingdom of Kabul , as mentioned by the  British  statesman and historian  Mountstuart Elphinstone . [ 17 ]  Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the  Kingdom of Balkh  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [ 18 ]   With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name ""Afghanistan"" to the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties between the  British Raj  and  Qajarid Persia , referring to the lands subject to the  Pashtun   Barakzai Dynasty  of Kabul. [ 19 ]  ""Afghanistan"" as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in 1857 by  Friedrich Engels . [ 20 ]  It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in 1919, after regaining full independence over its  foreign affairs  from the British, [ 21 ]  and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 constitution. [ 22 ]     Geography       Main article:  Geography of Afghanistan              Topography       Afghanistan is a landlocked and  mountainous  country in South- Central Asia , with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point is  Nowshak , at 7,485 m (24,557 ft) above sea level. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. The  endorheic   Sistan Basin  is one of the driest regions in the world. [ 23 ]  Afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to minor  earthquakes , mainly in the northeast of  Hindu Kush  mountain areas. Some 125 villages were damaged and 4000 people killed by the May 30, 1998 earthquake.   At 249,984 sq mi (647,500 km), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after  Myanmar ).   Tajikistan ,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  border Afghanistan to the north,  Iran  to the west,  Pakistan  to the south and the  People's Republic of China  to the east.   The country's natural resources include  gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  zinc  and  iron ore  in southeastern areas; precious and  semi-precious stones  such as  lapis ,  emerald  and  azure  in the north-east; and potentially significant  petroleum  and  natural gas  reserves in the north. The country also has  uranium ,  coal ,  chromite ,  talc ,  barites ,  sulfur ,  lead , and  salt . [ 1 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  However, these significant mineral and energy resources remain largely untapped due to the effects of the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. Plans are underway to begin extracting them in the near future. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]     History       Main article:  History of Afghanistan              For many centuries, the region that is now  Afghanistan  was the eastern part of the  Persian Empire . Ever since, it forms the eastern periphery to the  Iranian Cultural Continent .       Though the modern state of Afghanistan was founded or created in 1747 by  Ahmad Shah Durrani [ 10 ] , the land has an ancient history and various timelines of different civilizations. Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the area were among the earliest in the world. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Afghanistan is a country at a unique nexus point where numerous  Indo-European  civilizations have interacted and often fought, and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region has been home to various people, among them the  Aryan  ( Indo-Iranian ) tribes, such as the  Kambojas ,  Bactrians ,  Pashtuns , etc. It also has been conquered by a host of people, including the  Median  and  Persian Empires ,  Alexander the Great ,  Turks , and  Mongols . In recent times, invasions from the  British ,  Soviets , and most recently by the  United States and their allies  have taken place. On the other hand, native entities have invaded surrounding regions in  Iranian plateau ,  Central Asia  and  Indian subcontinent  to form empires of their own.   In 2000 BC,  Indo-European -speaking  Aryans  are thought to have been in the region of Afghanistan. It is unlikely [ 31 ]  that the  Aryans  themselves originated in Afghanistan although they did migrate from there south towards India and west towards  Persia , but they also migrated into Europe via north of the Caspian. These Aryans set up a nation which became known as  Airynem Vejah . Original homelands of the  Aryans  have been proposed as Anatolia, Kurdistan, Central Asia, Iran, or Northern India, with the directions of the historical migration varying accordingly. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Later, during the rule of  Ashkanian ,  Sasanian  and after, it was called Ernshahr ( Persian :    -  rnahr ) meaning Dominion of the Aryans.   It has been speculated that  Zoroastrianism  might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BC, as  Zoroaster  lived and died in  Balkh . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]  Ancient  Eastern Iranian languages , such as  Avestan , may have been spoken in this region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the sixth century BC, the  Persian Empire  of the  Achaemenid  Persians overthrew the  Median Empire  and incorporated Afghanistan (known as  Arachosia  to the Greeks) within its boundaries.  Alexander the Great  conquered Afghanistan after 330 BCE. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the  Seleucid Empire  controlled the area until 305 BCE, when they gave most of the area to the  Mauryan Empire  as part of an alliance treaty. During Mauryan rule,  Buddhism  became the dominant religion in the region. The Mauryans were overthrown by the  Sunga Dynasty  in 185 BCE, leading to the  Hellenistic  reconquest of Afghanistan by the  Greco-Bactrians  by 180 BCE. Much of Afghanistan soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the  Indo-Greek Kingdom . The Indo-Greeks were defeated by the  Indo-Scythians  and expelled from most of Afghanistan by the end of the 2nd century BCE.          The  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom  at its maximum extent, circa 180 BCE       During the first century, the  Parthian Empire  subjugated Afghanistan, but lost it to their  Indo-Parthian  vassals. In the mid to late 1st century AD the vast  Kushan Empire , centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the  Sassanids  in the third century. Although various rulers calling themselves  Kushanshas  (generally known as  Indo-Sassanids ) continued to rule at least parts of the region, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids. [ 36 ]  The late Kushans were followed by the  Kidarite  Huns [ 37 ]  who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful  Hephthalites , as rulers of the region in the first half of the fifth century. [ 38 ]  The Hephthalites were defeated by the Sasanian king  Khosrau I  in AD 557, who re-established Sassanid power in Persia. However, the successors of Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in  Kabulistan  called  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Kabul-Shahan / Shahi , who were later defeated by the Muslim  Arab  armies and finally conquered by Muslim Turkish armies led by the  Ghaznavids .     Islamic and Mongol conquests of the region          Afghanistan was the eastern frontier of the Islamic Caliphate by 750.           Main articles:  Islamic conquest of Afghanistan  and  Mongol invasion of Central Asia       In the  Middle Ages , up to the nineteenth century, Afghanistan was part of a larger region known as  Greater Khorasan . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  Several important centers of Khorsn are thus located in modern Afghanistan, such as  Balkh ,  Herat ,  Ghazni  and  Kabul . It was during this period of time when  Islam  was introduced and spread in the area.   The region of Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including that of the  Samanids  (875999),  Ghaznavids  (9771187),  Seljukids  (10371194),  Ghurids  (11491212),  Mongol Empire ,  Ilkhanate  (12251335), and  Timurids  (13701506). Among them, the periods of the Ghaznavids [ 42 ]  and Timurids [ 43 ]  are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of the region's history.   In 1219 the region was overrun by the  Mongols  under  Genghis Khan , who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the  Ilkhanate  [one of 4 Subordinate Mongolian Khanates], and was extended further following the  invasion  of  Timur Lang  (Tamerlane), a ruler from Central Asia. In 1504,  Babur , a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the  Mughal Empire  with its capital at  Kabul . By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups:  Uzbeks  to the north,  Safavids  to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self-ruled by local tribes.     Hotaki dynasty       Main article:  Hotaki dynasty       In 1709,  Mir Wais Hotak , a local Afghan ( Pashtun ) from the  Ghilzai  clan, overthrew and killed  Gurgin Khan , the Safavid governor of  Kandahar . Mir Wais successfully defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the local population of Kandahar from  Sunni  to the  Shia  sect of  Islam . Mir Wais held the region of Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki . In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an Afghan army to  Isfahan  ( Iran ), sacked the city and proclaimed himself  King of Persia . However, the great majority still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan by the Afghans  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the  Hotaki dynasty  was eventually removed from power by a new ruler,  Nadir Shah  of Persia. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]          Conquest of the Afghan Durrani Empire at its greatest extent         Durrani Empire: beginnings of the Afghan state       Main article:  Durrani Empire       In 1738 Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns of the  Abdali  clan [ 46 ] , conquered the region of Kandahar; in the same year he occupied Ghazni, Kabul and  Lahore . On June 19, 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated, possibly planned by his nephew  Ali Qoli . In the same year, one of Nadir's military commanders and personal bodyguard,  Ahmad Shah Abdali , a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a  loya jirga  following Nadir's death. The Afghans gathered at  Kandahar  and chose Ahmad Shah as their King. Since then, he is often regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. [ 1 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  After the inauguration, he changed his title or clans' name to  Durrani , which derives from the Persian word  Durr , meaning  Pearl . [ 46 ]   By 1751 Ahmad Shah Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with  Delhi  in India. [ 20 ]  In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in  Maruf , Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He was succeeded by his son,  Timur Shah Durrani , who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was finally succeeded by his son  Zaman Shah Durrani .     European influence and the creation of the state of Afghanistan       Main article:  European influence in Afghanistan              King Amanullah on a royal trip to Berlin. This trip initiated a great alliance between Afghanistan and Germany that continues to this day.       During the nineteenth century, following the  Anglo-Afghan wars  (fought 183942, 187880, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the  Barakzai dynasty , Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the United Kingdom. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King  Amanullah Khan  acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its foreign affairs (see  The Great Game ). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the  Durand Line . This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India  and later the new state of Pakistan  over what came to be known as the  Pashtunistan  debate.     The Kingdom of Afghanistan   King  Amanullah  (1919-1929) moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the Third Anglo-Afghan war. He established diplomatic relations with most major countries and, following a 1927 tour of  Europe  and  Turkey  (during which he noted the modernization and secularization advanced by  Atatrk ), introduced several reforms intended to modernize Afghanistan. A key force behind these reforms was  Mahmud Tarzi ,  Amanullah Khan 's Foreign Minister and father-in-law - and an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a  Loya Jirga ), which made elementary education compulsory. [ 49 ]  Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional  Muslim   veil  for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after  Kabul  fell to forces led by  Habibullah Kalakani .          Afghan King Zahir Shah and his wife with then-US  President John F. Kennedy  and Caroline Kennedy       .   Prince Mohammed Nadir Khan, a cousin of Amanullah's, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October of the same year, and with considerable Pashtun tribal support he was declared King Nadir Shah. He began consolidating power and regenerating the country. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a Kabul student.   Mohammad Zahir Shah, Nadir Khan's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was when the country was under the rule of  King Zahir Shah . Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. In 1946, another of Zahir Shah's uncles,  Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan , became Prime Minister and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced as Prime Minister by  Mohammed Daoud Khan , the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the  Soviet Union  and a more distant one towards  Pakistan .     Republic of Afghanistan       Main article:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan       However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law,  Mohammed Daoud Khan , launched a bloodless coup and became the first  President of Afghanistan  while Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit. Mohammed Daoud Khan jammed Afghan radio's with anti-Pakistani broadcasts and looked to the Soviet Union and the United States for aid for development.   In 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or Kaibar), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA managed to remain at large and organised an uprising.   The PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' means 'April' in Pashto). On May 1, Taraki became  President ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Some are of the opinion that the 1978  Khalq  uprising against the government of Daoud Khan was essentially a resurgence by the  Ghilzai  tribe of the  Pashtun  against the  Durrani  (the tribe of Daoud Khan and the previous monarchy). [ 50 ]          Kabul's Queens Palace before the Soviet invasion, as the headquarters of the PDPA.       Once in power, the PDPA moved to permit  freedom of religion  and carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide. They also made a number of statements on  womens rights  and introduced women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous May 28, 1978  New Kabul Times  editorial which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country  Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention. [ 51 ]   Many people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with religiously conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' law.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter ) began to covertly fund forces ranged against the pro-Soviet government, although warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention, (according to National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ). [ 52 ]  The  Mujahideen  belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On September 14, Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     Soviet invasion and civil war       Main articles:  Soviet war in Afghanistan  and  Civil war in Afghanistan       In order to bolster the  Parcham  faction, the Soviet Unionciting the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countriesintervened on December 24, 1979. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100,000 plus and by members of the Parcham faction. Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and part of its overall  Cold War  strategy, the  United States  responded by arming and otherwise supporting the Afghan  mujahideen , which had taken up arms against the Soviet occupiers. U.S. support began during the  Carter  administration, but increased substantially during the  Reagan administration , in which it became a centerpiece of the so-called  Reagan Doctrine  under which the U.S. provided support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan and also in  Angola ,  Nicaragua , and other nations. In addition to U.S. support, the mujahideen received support from  Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and other nations.   The Soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians. Over five million  Afghans  fled their country to Pakistan, Iran and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989.    The Soviet withdrawal from the DRA was seen as an ideological victory in the U.S., which had backed the Mujahideen through three U.S. presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich  Persian Gulf .   Following the removal of the Soviet forces, the U.S. and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. [ citation needed ]  The  USSR  continued to support President  Najibullah  (former head of the Afghan secret service,  KHAD ) until 1992 when the new Russian government refused to sell oil products to the Najibullah regime. [ 53 ]   Because of the fighting, a number of elites and intellectuals fled to take refuge abroad. This led to a leadership imbalance in Afghanistan. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, which gave rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. It was at this time that the  Taliban  developed as a politico-religious force, eventually seizing Kabul in 1996 and establishing the  Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . By the end of 2000 the Taliban had captured 95% of the country.   During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. [ 54 ]  Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. [ 55 ]  The majority of the opium production was eradicated by 2001.

Current President Hamid Karzai reviewing the Presidential Guard in Kabul.       Following the  September 11 attacks  the United States launched  Operation Enduring Freedom , a military campaign to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The U.S. military also threatened to overthrow the Taliban government for refusing to hand over  Osama bin Laden  and several al-Qaida members. The U.S. made a common cause with the former Afghan Mujahideen to achieve its ends, including the  Northern Alliance , a militia still recognized by the  UN  as the Afghan government.   In late 2001, the United States sent teams of CIA Paramilitary Officers from their  Special Activities Division  and U.S. Army Special Forces to invade Afghanistan to aid anti-Taliban militias, backed by U.S. air strikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda targets, culminating in the seizure of Kabul by the Northern Alliance and the overthrow of the Taliban, with many local warlords switching allegiance from the Taliban to the Northern Alliance. [ 57 ]   In December of the same year, leaders of the former Afghan mujahideen and diaspora met in Germany, and agreed on a  plan  for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of  Hamid Karzai , an ethnic Pashtun of the Durrani clan (from which the royal family was drawn) from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the  Afghan Interim Authority .   After a nationwide  Loya Jirga  in 2002, Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim President of Afghanistan. The country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) in 2003 and a new  constitution  was ratified in January 2004. Following an election in October 2004, Hamid Karzai won and became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly  the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973  sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.   As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor  infrastructure , large concentration of  land mines  and other unexploded ordnance, as well as a huge illegal  poppy  cultivation and  opium  trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the  Taliban insurgency  and the threat of attacks from a few remaining al Qaeda.   At the start of 2007 reports of the Taliban's increasing presence in Afghanistan led the U.S. to consider longer tours of duty and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007, U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions. Also, The number of insurgent attacks is up 300 percent since September, 2006, when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters.     See also:  Timeline of the history of Afghanistan  and  Invasions of Afghanistan       Government and politics       Main article:  Politics of Afghanistan       Politics in Afghanistan has historically consisted of power struggles, bloody  coups  and unstable transfers of power. With the exception of a  military junta , the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a  monarchy ,  republic ,  theocracy  and  communist state . The constitution ratified by the  2003 Loya jirga  restructured the government as an  Islamic republic  consisting of three branches, ( executive ,  legislature  and  judiciary ).   Afghanistan is currently led by President  Hamid Karzai , who was elected in October 2004. The current  parliament  was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members, communists,  reformists , and  Islamic fundamentalists . 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3 points more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, long known under the Taliban for its  oppression of women , one of the leading countries in terms of female representation. Construction for a new parliament building began on August 29, 2005.   The  Supreme Court of Afghanistan  is currently led by Chief Justice  Abdul Salam Azimi , a former university professor who had been legal advisor to the president. [ 58 ]  The previous court, appointed during the time of the interim government, had been dominated by fundamentalist religious figures, including Chief Justice  Faisal Ahmad Shinwari . The court issued several rulings, such as banning  cable television , seeking to ban a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and limiting the rights of women, as well as overstepping its constitutional authority by issuing rulings on subjects not yet brought before the court. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more  technocrats  than the previous court, although it has yet to issue any rulings.

They are being trained by and through the  Afghanistan Police Program . Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, sometimes local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners. In 2003 the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, now under command of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) was extended and expanded beyond the  Kabul  area. However, in some areas unoccupied by those forces, local militias maintain control. In many areas, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police and/or communications. Troops of the  Afghan National Army  have been sent to quell fighting in some regions lacking police protection. [ 59 ]   The  Afghan National Army  currently has 80,000 troops, with plans to nearly double in the next few years. The Afghan Army is not affected by corruption as the National Police due to international oversight.     Administrative divisions       Main articles:  Provinces of Afghanistan  and  Districts of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is administratively divided into thirty-four (34)  provinces  ( welayats ), and for each province there is a capital. Each province is then divided into many provincial  districts , and each district normally covers a city or several  townships .   The  Governor  of the province is appointed by the  Ministry of Interior , and the  Prefects  for the districts of the province will be appointed by the provincial Governor. The Governor is the representative of the central government of Afghanistan, and is responsible for all administrative and formal issues. The provincial  Chief of Police  is appointed by the Ministry of Interior, who works together with the Governor on law enforcement for all the cities or districts of that province.   There is an exception in the capital city (Kabul) where the  Mayor  is selected by the  President of Afghanistan , and is completely independent from the  prefecture  of the  Kabul Province .

Therefore, relations between Afghanistan and NATO members is strong. Afghanistan depends a lot on multi-billion dollar aid infusions from the United States. Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany are also large donors.   Relations between Afghanistan and the  Islamic Republic of Iran  are very strong. The two nations share the same language and culture, and both countries are part of  Greater Persia . Shiites and Sunnis get a long well in Afghanistan which causes no religious tensions between the two nations. Iran is a consistent donor towards Afghan reconstruction.   Afghan and Pakistani relations always fluctuate. The two nations are always disputing, but recent relations have deteriorated vastly. Afghan Intelligence and American agencies accuse Pakistan of working to stop Afghan reconstruction mainly through the  Inter-Services Intelligence . Most of the Taliban come from Pakistan and Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Pakistan. Afghanistan and Pakistan recently fought a series of border skirmishes and the US has lead several air strikes in Pakistani territory from Afghan air bases.   Afghanistan maintains excellent relations with their Northern Allies, including  Uzbekistan ,  Tajikistan  and  Turkmenistan  as all three share a similar culture as the Afghans.  Hazaras  are from those nations.   Afghanistan also has good relations with Russia and India. India is a leading investor in Afghanistan, alongside Iran, and the current Afghan President, Hamid Karzai received some of his college education in India.   Afghanistan has excellent relations with the rest of the Arab and  Muslim world . Afghanistan has no relations with Israel and alongside ally Iran, is a frequent non-Arab critic of Israel.

Both are  Indo-European languages  from the  Iranian languages  sub-family, and the  official languages  of the country.  Hazaragi , spoken by the Hazara minority, is a distinct dialect of Persian. Other languages spoken include the  Turkic languages   Uzbek  and  Turkmen  (ca. 9% combined), as well as 30 minor languages, primarily  Balochi ,  Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui ,  Pamiri languages ,  Hindko , etc. (ca. 4% combined).  Bilingualism  is common.   According to the Encyclopdia Iranica, [ 65 ]  the Persian language is the most widely used language of the country, spoken by around 80% of the population, while Pashto is spoken and understood by around 50% of the population. According to  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , [ 63 ]  Persian is the first language of 49% of the population, while additional 37% speak the language as a second language (combined 86%). Pashto is the first language of 40% of the population, while additional 27% know the language (combined 67%). Uzbek is spoken or understood by 6% of the population, Turkmen by 3%. According to the survey  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand""  (avarege numbers from 2005-2009), 69% of the interviewed people preferred Persian, while 31% spoke Pashto. [ 64 ]     Culture       Main article:  Culture of Afghanistan       Afghans display pride in their religion, country, ancestry, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their  clan  loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. [ 66 ]  As clan warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.   Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of Buddha in the Bamyan Province were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as  idolatrous . Other famous sites include the cities of  Kandahar , Heart, Ghazni and Balkh. The Minaret of Jam, in the  Hari River  valley, is a  UNESCO World Heritage site . The cloak worn by  Muhammad  is stored inside the famous Khalka Sharifa in Kandahar City.   Buzkashi  is a national sport in Afghanistan. It is similar to  polo  and played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a  goat  carcass.  Afghan hounds  (a type of running  dog ) also originated in Afghanistan.   Although literacy levels are very low, classic  Persian poetry  plays a very important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in  Iran  and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Persian culture has, and continues to, exert a great influence over Afghan culture. Private poetry competition events known as mushaera are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every homeowner owns one or more poetry collections of some sort, even if they are not read often.   The eastern dialects of the Persian language are popularly known as ""Dari"". The name itself derives from ""Prs-e Darbr"", meaning  Persian of the royal courts . The ancient term  Dar   one of the original names of the Persian language  was revived in the Afghan constitution of 1964, and was intended ""to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language. Hence, the name  Frs , the language of  Frs , is strictly avoided."" [ 67 ]          Girls in Kabul, wearing their traditional clothes, sing at a celebration of International Women's Day       in 2002.]]   Many of the famous  Persian poets  of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from Khorasan where is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy.     Mawln Rumi , who was born and educated in Balkh in the thirteenth century and moved to  Konya  in modern-day  Turkey   Rabi'a Balkhi  (the first poetess in the History of Persian Poetry, tenth century, native of Balkh)   Daqiqi Balkhi  (tenth century, native of Balkh)   Farrukhi Sistani  (tenth century, the  Ghaznavids  royal poet)   Unsuri Balkhi  (a tenth/eleventh century poet, native of Balkh)   Khwaja Abdullah Ansari  (eleventh century, from Herat)   Nasir Khusraw  (eleventh century, from Qubadyan near Balkh)   Anvari  (twelfth century, lived and died in Balkh)   San' Ghaznawi  (twelfth century, native of Ghazni)   Jm of Hert  (fifteenth century, native of Herat in western Afghanistan), and his nephew Abdullah Hatifi Herawi, a well-known poet   Al Sher Nav'  (fifteenth century, Herat).     Most of these individuals were of Persian ( Tjk ) ethnicity who still form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-known in Persian-speaking world, include  Khalilullah Khalili , [ 68 ]  Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari, [ 69 ]  Sarwar Joya,  Parwin Pazwak  and others. In 2003, Khaled Hosseini published The  Kite Runner  which though fiction, captured much of the history, politics and culture experienced in Afghanistan from the 1930s to present day.   In addition to poets and authors, numerous  Persian scientists  were born or worked in the region of present-day Afghanistan. Most notable was  Avicenna  (Abu Al Hussein ibn Sn) whose father hailed from Balkh. Ibn Sn, who travelled to  Isfahan  later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as ""the father of modern medicine"". George Sarton called ibn Sn ""the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times."" His most famous works are  The Book of Healing  and  The Canon of Medicine , also known as the Qanun. Ibn Sn's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through  Noah Gordon 's  The Physician , now published in many languages. Moreover, according to  Ibn al-Nadim ,  Al-Farabi , a well-known philosopher and scientist, was from the Faryab Province of Afghanistan.   Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the  Nauroz -celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the twentieth century has been likened to  Vienna  during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.   The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is potent in political terms. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, they would assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders. In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call.   Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. [ 66 ]     Religions       Main article:  Religion in Afghanistan       Religiously, Afghans are over 99%  Muslims : approximately 74-80%  Sunni  and 19-25%  Shi'a [ 1 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  (estimates vary). Up until the mid-1980s, there were about 30,000 to 150,000  Hindus  and  Sikhs  living in different cities, mostly in  Jalalabad ,  Kabul , and  Kandahar . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]   There was a small  Jewish  community in Afghanistan ( see  Bukharan Jews ) who fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual,  Zablon Simintov , remains today. [ 74 ]     Economy       Main article:  Economy of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is a member of the  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ,  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  and the  Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) . It is an impoverished country, one of the world's poorest and least developed. Two-thirds of the population lives on fewer than 2  US  dollars a day. Its economy has suffered greatly from the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 19982001. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). As of 2005, the official unemployment rate is at 40%. [ 77 ]  The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. [ 78 ]   The nation's economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion  US dollars  in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats. [ 79 ]  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.   The real value of  non-drug  GDP increased by 29% in 2002, 16% in 2003, 8% in 2004 and 14% in 2005. [ 80 ]  As much as one-third of Afghanistan's  GDP  comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including  opium  and its two derivatives,  morphine  and  heroin , as well as  hashish  production. [ 1 ]   Opium production in Afghanistan  has soared to a new record in 2007, with an increase on last year of more than a third, the United Nations has said. [ 81 ]  Some 3.3 million Afghans are now involved in producing opium. [ 82 ]  In a recent article in the  Washington Quarterly , Peter van Ham and Jorrit Kamminga argue that the international community should establish a pilot project and investigate a licensing scheme to start the production of medicines such as morphine and codeine from poppy crops to help it escape the economic dependence on opium: [ 83 ]   According to a 2004 report by the  Asian Development Bank , the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development. [ 78 ]  In 2006, two U.S. companies, Black & Veatch and the  Louis Berger Group , have won a US 1.4 billion dollar contract to rebuild roads, power lines and water supply systems of Afghanistan. [ 84 ]   One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 4 million refugees from neighbouring countries and the  West , who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. What is also helping is the estimated US 23 billion dollars in international assistance every year, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. Private developments are also beginning to get underway. In 2006, a Dubai-based Afghan family opened a $25 million  Coca Cola  bottling plant in Afghanistan. [ 85 ]   While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion  about 15%  is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the  United Nations  system and  non-governmental organizations . The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.   Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the Afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old Afghani by 1 new Afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003. [ 78 ]   The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels. Since 2003, over sixteen new banks have opened in the country, including  Afghanistan International Bank ,  Kabul Bank ,  Azizi Bank ,  Standard Chartered Bank ,  First Micro Finance Bank , and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year  tax holidays  to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports  tariffs  and duties.   Some private investment projects, backed with national support, are also beginning to pick up steam in Afghanistan. An initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr.  Hisham N. Ashkouri , Principal of ARCADD, Inc. for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue, [ 86 ]  revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the  Afghan National Museum .   According to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to 36 trillion cubic feet (1,000 km 3 ) of  natural gas , 3.6 billion barrels (570,000,000 m 3 ) of  petroleum  and up to 1,325 million barrels (2.107E+8 m 3 ) of  natural gas liquids . This could mark the turning point in Afghanistans reconstruction efforts. Energy exports could generate the revenue that Afghan officials need to modernize the countrys infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for the beleaguered and fractious population. [ 27 ]  Other reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal,  iron ore  and other  minerals . [ 24 ] [ 28 ] [ 87 ]  The government of Afghanistan is in the process of extracting and exporting its copper reserves, which will be earning $1.2 billion US dollars in  royalties  and taxes every year for the next 30 years. It will also provide permanent labor to 3,000 of its citizens.

International flights include to  Dubai ,  Frankfurt ,  Istanbul  and a number of other destinations. [ citation needed ]  There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from  Kam Air ,  Pamir Airways  and Safi Airlines.   The country has limited rail service with Turkmenistan. There are two  railway  projects currently in progress, one is between Herat and the Iranian city  Mashad  while another is between Kandahar and  Quetta  in Pakistan. Most people who travel from one city to another use bus services. Automobiles have recently become more widely available, with  Toyota ,  Nissan  and  Hyundai  dealerships in Kabul. A large number of second-hand vehicles are also arriving from the  UAE . Nearly all highways and roads are being rebuilt in the country.     Communications and technology       Main article:  Communications in Afghanistan       Telecommunication services in the country are provided by  Afghan Wireless ,  Etisalat ,  Roshan ,  Areeba  and  Afghan Telecom . In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a  US$ 64.5 million agreement with  ZTE Corporation  for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country. [ 89 ]  Around 500,000 (1.5% of the population) had internet access by the end of 2008. [ 90 ]   Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.   The nation's post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as  FedEx ,  DHL  and others are also available.     Media       Main article:  Media of Afghanistan       The media was tightly controlled under the  Taliban  and other periods in its history, and was relatively free in others. Under the Taliban, television was shut down in 1996, and print media were forbidden to publish commentary, photos or readers letters. [ 91 ]  The only radio station broadcast religious programmes and  propaganda , and aired no music. [ 91 ]   After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified.  Freedom of expression  and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and  censorship  is banned, though  defaming  individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of  Islam  is prohibited. In 2008,  Reporters Without Borders  listed the media environment as 156 out of 173, with 1st being most free. [ 92 ]  400 publications are now registered and 60 radio stations, a major source of information, currently exist. [ 93 ]  Foreign radio stations, such as the  BBC World Service , also broadcast into the country. However,  press freedom  is threatened by the continuing  war in Afghanistan , with kidnappings of journalists, harassment and death threats.     Education       Main article:  Education in Afghanistan       As of 2006 more than four million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout the country. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. A lack of women teachers is an issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men. [ 94 ]   Literacy of the entire population is estimated (as of 1999) at 36%, the male literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. Up to now there are 9,500 schools in the country.   Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of  higher education . Following the fall of the Taliban,  Kabul University  was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the  American University of Afghanistan  also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The university accepts students from Afghanistan and the neighboring countries. Construction work will soon start at the new site selected for  University of Balkh  in Mazari Sharif. The new building for the university, including the building for the Engineering Department, would be constructed at  600 acres (2.4 km)  of land at the cost of 250 million US dollars. [ 95 ]   A new military school is in function to properly train and educate Afghan soldiers.     Images of Afghanistan             This section seems to be an image gallery .

It is variously designated as geographically located within  Central Asia , [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   South Asia , [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  and the  Middle East . [ 9 ]  It is bordered by  Pakistan  in the south and east,  Iran  in the south and west,  Turkmenistan ,  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  in the north, and  China  in the far northeast. The name  Afghanistan  means the  Land of  Afghans .   Afghanistan is a crossroads between the  East  and the  West , and has been an ancient focal point of  trade  and  migration . It has an important  geostrategical  location, connecting South and Central Asia and Middle East. During its long history, the land has seen various invaders and conquerors, while on the other hand, local entities invaded the surrounding vast regions to form their own empires.  Ahmad Shah Durrani  created the  Durrani Empire  in 1747, which is considered the beginning of modern Afghanistan. [ 10 ]  Subsequently, the capital was shifted to  Kabul  and most of its territories ceded to former neighboring countries. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a  buffer state  in "" The Great Game "" played between the  British Indian Empire  and  Russian Empire . [ 11 ]  On August 19, 1919, following the  third Anglo-Afghan war , the country regained full independence from the United Kingdom over its  foreign affairs .   Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous and brutal  civil war  in addition to foreign interventions in the form of the 1979  Soviet invasion  and the recent 2001  U.S.-led invasion  that toppled the  Taliban  government. In late 2001 the  United Nations Security Council  authorized the creation of an  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) . This force is composed of  NATO  troops that are involved in assisting the government of President  Hamid Karzai  in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key  infrastructures  in the nation. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion  US dollars  have also been provided by the international community for the  reconstruction  of the country.

Its modern usage derives from the word  Afghan .     Origin of the name   The first part of the name, ""Afghan"", is an alternative name for the  Pashtuns  who are the founders and the largest ethnic group of the country. They probably began using the term  Afghan  as a name for themselves since at least the  Islamic  period and onwards. According to W. K. Frazier Tyler, M. C. Gillet and several other scholars,  ""The word Afghan first appears in history in the  udd al-lam  in 982 AD.""   Al-Biruni  referred to Afghans as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the  Indus River , which would be the  Sulaiman Mountains . [ 12 ]   A  Moroccan  traveller,  Ibn Battuta , visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: [ 13 ]       We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of  Persians  called Afghans.       In this regard the  Encyclopdia Iranica  states: [ 14 ]       From a more limited, ethnological point of view, ""Af gh n"" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Pat-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Patn. The equation [of]  Afghan  [and]  Patn  has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Patn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically.       It further explains:       The term ""Af gh n"" has probably designated the Patn since ancient times. Under the form  Avagn , this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer  Varha Mihira  in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his  Brihat-samhita .       This information is supported by traditional  Pashto literature , for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet  Khushal Khan Khattak : [ 15 ]       Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!       The last part of the name,  -stn  is an ancient  Indo-Iranian  suffix for ""place"", prominent in many languages of the region.   The term "" Afghanistan ,"" meaning the "" Land of Afghans ,"" was mentioned by the sixteenth century  Mughal Emperor  Babur in his  memoirs , referring to the territories south of  Kabul  that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called  ""Afghans""  by Babur). [ 16 ]   Until the 19th century the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the  Kingdom of Kabul , as mentioned by the  British  statesman and historian  Mountstuart Elphinstone . [ 17 ]  Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the  Kingdom of Balkh  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [ 18 ]   With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name ""Afghanistan"" to the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties between the  British Raj  and  Qajarid Persia , referring to the lands subject to the  Pashtun   Barakzai Dynasty  of Kabul. [ 19 ]  ""Afghanistan"" as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in 1857 by  Friedrich Engels . [ 20 ]  It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in 1919, after regaining full independence over its  foreign affairs  from the British, [ 21 ]  and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 constitution. [ 22 ]     Geography       Main article:  Geography of Afghanistan              Topography       Afghanistan is a landlocked and  mountainous  country in South- Central Asia , with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point is  Nowshak , at 7,485 m (24,557 ft) above sea level. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. The  endorheic   Sistan Basin  is one of the driest regions in the world. [ 23 ]  Afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to minor  earthquakes , mainly in the northeast of  Hindu Kush  mountain areas. Some 125 villages were damaged and 4000 people killed by the May 30, 1998 earthquake.   At 249,984 sq mi (647,500 km), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after  Myanmar ).   Tajikistan ,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  border Afghanistan to the north,  Iran  to the west,  Pakistan  to the south and the  People's Republic of China  to the east.   The country's natural resources include  gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  zinc  and  iron ore  in southeastern areas; precious and  semi-precious stones  such as  lapis ,  emerald  and  azure  in the north-east; and potentially significant  petroleum  and  natural gas  reserves in the north. The country also has  uranium ,  coal ,  chromite ,  talc ,  barites ,  sulfur ,  lead , and  salt . [ 1 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  However, these significant mineral and energy resources remain largely untapped due to the effects of the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. Plans are underway to begin extracting them in the near future. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]     History       Main article:  History of Afghanistan              For many centuries, the region that is now  Afghanistan  was the eastern part of the  Persian Empire . Ever since, it forms the eastern periphery to the  Iranian Cultural Continent .       Though the modern state of Afghanistan was founded or created in 1747 by  Ahmad Shah Durrani [ 10 ] , the land has an ancient history and various timelines of different civilizations. Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the area were among the earliest in the world. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Afghanistan is a country at a unique nexus point where numerous  Indo-European  civilizations have interacted and often fought, and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region has been home to various people, among them the  Aryan  ( Indo-Iranian ) tribes, such as the  Kambojas ,  Bactrians ,  Pashtuns , etc. It also has been conquered by a host of people, including the  Median  and  Persian Empires ,  Alexander the Great ,  Turks , and  Mongols . In recent times, invasions from the  British ,  Soviets , and most recently by the  United States and their allies  have taken place. On the other hand, native entities have invaded surrounding regions in  Iranian plateau ,  Central Asia  and  Indian subcontinent  to form empires of their own.   In 2000 BC,  Indo-European -speaking  Aryans  are thought to have been in the region of Afghanistan. It is unlikely [ 31 ]  that the  Aryans  themselves originated in Afghanistan although they did migrate from there south towards India and west towards  Persia , but they also migrated into Europe via north of the Caspian. These Aryans set up a nation which became known as  Airynem Vejah . Original homelands of the  Aryans  have been proposed as Anatolia, Kurdistan, Central Asia, Iran, or Northern India, with the directions of the historical migration varying accordingly. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Later, during the rule of  Ashkanian ,  Sasanian  and after, it was called Ernshahr ( Persian :    -  rnahr ) meaning Dominion of the Aryans.   It has been speculated that  Zoroastrianism  might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BC, as  Zoroaster  lived and died in  Balkh . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]  Ancient  Eastern Iranian languages , such as  Avestan , may have been spoken in this region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the sixth century BC, the  Persian Empire  of the  Achaemenid  Persians overthrew the  Median Empire  and incorporated Afghanistan (known as  Arachosia  to the Greeks) within its boundaries.  Alexander the Great  conquered Afghanistan after 330 BCE. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the  Seleucid Empire  controlled the area until 305 BCE, when they gave most of the area to the  Mauryan Empire  as part of an alliance treaty. During Mauryan rule,  Buddhism  became the dominant religion in the region. The Mauryans were overthrown by the  Sunga Dynasty  in 185 BCE, leading to the  Hellenistic  reconquest of Afghanistan by the  Greco-Bactrians  by 180 BCE. Much of Afghanistan soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the  Indo-Greek Kingdom . The Indo-Greeks were defeated by the  Indo-Scythians  and expelled from most of Afghanistan by the end of the 2nd century BCE.          The  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom  at its maximum extent, circa 180 BCE       During the first century, the  Parthian Empire  subjugated Afghanistan, but lost it to their  Indo-Parthian  vassals. In the mid to late 1st century AD the vast  Kushan Empire , centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the  Sassanids  in the third century. Although various rulers calling themselves  Kushanshas  (generally known as  Indo-Sassanids ) continued to rule at least parts of the region, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids. [ 36 ]  The late Kushans were followed by the  Kidarite  Huns [ 37 ]  who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful  Hephthalites , as rulers of the region in the first half of the fifth century. [ 38 ]  The Hephthalites were defeated by the Sasanian king  Khosrau I  in AD 557, who re-established Sassanid power in Persia. However, the successors of Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in  Kabulistan  called  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Kabul-Shahan / Shahi , who were later defeated by the Muslim  Arab  armies and finally conquered by Muslim Turkish armies led by the  Ghaznavids .     Islamic and Mongol conquests of the region          Afghanistan was the eastern frontier of the Islamic Caliphate by 750.           Main articles:  Islamic conquest of Afghanistan  and  Mongol invasion of Central Asia       In the  Middle Ages , up to the nineteenth century, Afghanistan was part of a larger region known as  Greater Khorasan . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  Several important centers of Khorsn are thus located in modern Afghanistan, such as  Balkh ,  Herat ,  Ghazni  and  Kabul . It was during this period of time when  Islam  was introduced and spread in the area.   The region of Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including that of the  Samanids  (875999),  Ghaznavids  (9771187),  Seljukids  (10371194),  Ghurids  (11491212),  Mongol Empire ,  Ilkhanate  (12251335), and  Timurids  (13701506). Among them, the periods of the Ghaznavids [ 42 ]  and Timurids [ 43 ]  are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of the region's history.   In 1219 the region was overrun by the  Mongols  under  Genghis Khan , who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the  Ilkhanate  [one of 4 Subordinate Mongolian Khanates], and was extended further following the  invasion  of  Timur Lang  (Tamerlane), a ruler from Central Asia. In 1504,  Babur , a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the  Mughal Empire  with its capital at  Kabul . By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups:  Uzbeks  to the north,  Safavids  to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self-ruled by local tribes.     Hotaki dynasty       Main article:  Hotaki dynasty       In 1709,  Mir Wais Hotak , a local Afghan ( Pashtun ) from the  Ghilzai  clan, overthrew and killed  Gurgin Khan , the Safavid governor of  Kandahar . Mir Wais successfully defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the local population of Kandahar from  Sunni  to the  Shia  sect of  Islam . Mir Wais held the region of Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki . In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an Afghan army to  Isfahan  ( Iran ), sacked the city and proclaimed himself  King of Persia . However, the great majority still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan by the Afghans  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the  Hotaki dynasty  was eventually removed from power by a new ruler,  Nadir Shah  of Persia. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]          Conquest of the Afghan Durrani Empire at its greatest extent         Durrani Empire: beginnings of the Afghan state       Main article:  Durrani Empire       In 1738 Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns of the  Abdali  clan [ 46 ] , conquered the region of Kandahar; in the same year he occupied Ghazni, Kabul and  Lahore . On June 19, 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated, possibly planned by his nephew  Ali Qoli . In the same year, one of Nadir's military commanders and personal bodyguard,  Ahmad Shah Abdali , a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a  loya jirga  following Nadir's death. The Afghans gathered at  Kandahar  and chose Ahmad Shah as their King. Since then, he is often regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. [ 1 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  After the inauguration, he changed his title or clans' name to  Durrani , which derives from the Persian word  Durr , meaning  Pearl . [ 46 ]   By 1751 Ahmad Shah Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with  Delhi  in India. [ 20 ]  In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in  Maruf , Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He was succeeded by his son,  Timur Shah Durrani , who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was finally succeeded by his son  Zaman Shah Durrani .     European influence and the creation of the state of Afghanistan       Main article:  European influence in Afghanistan              King Amanullah on a royal trip to Berlin. This trip initiated a great alliance between Afghanistan and Germany that continues to this day.       During the nineteenth century, following the  Anglo-Afghan wars  (fought 183942, 187880, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the  Barakzai dynasty , Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the United Kingdom. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King  Amanullah Khan  acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its foreign affairs (see  The Great Game ). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the  Durand Line . This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India  and later the new state of Pakistan  over what came to be known as the  Pashtunistan  debate.     The Kingdom of Afghanistan   King  Amanullah  (1919-1929) moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the Third Anglo-Afghan war. He established diplomatic relations with most major countries and, following a 1927 tour of  Europe  and  Turkey  (during which he noted the modernization and secularization advanced by  Atatrk ), introduced several reforms intended to modernize Afghanistan. A key force behind these reforms was  Mahmud Tarzi ,  Amanullah Khan 's Foreign Minister and father-in-law - and an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a  Loya Jirga ), which made elementary education compulsory. [ 49 ]  Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional  Muslim   veil  for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after  Kabul  fell to forces led by  Habibullah Kalakani .          Afghan King Zahir Shah and his wife with then-US  President John F. Kennedy  and Caroline Kennedy       .   Prince Mohammed Nadir Khan, a cousin of Amanullah's, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October of the same year, and with considerable Pashtun tribal support he was declared King Nadir Shah. He began consolidating power and regenerating the country. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a Kabul student.   Mohammad Zahir Shah, Nadir Khan's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was when the country was under the rule of  King Zahir Shah . Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. In 1946, another of Zahir Shah's uncles,  Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan , became Prime Minister and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced as Prime Minister by  Mohammed Daoud Khan , the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the  Soviet Union  and a more distant one towards  Pakistan .     Republic of Afghanistan       Main article:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan       However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law,  Mohammed Daoud Khan , launched a bloodless coup and became the first  President of Afghanistan  while Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit. Mohammed Daoud Khan jammed Afghan radio's with anti-Pakistani broadcasts and looked to the Soviet Union and the United States for aid for development.   In 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or Kaibar), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA managed to remain at large and organised an uprising.   The PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' means 'April' in Pashto). On May 1, Taraki became  President ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Some are of the opinion that the 1978  Khalq  uprising against the government of Daoud Khan was essentially a resurgence by the  Ghilzai  tribe of the  Pashtun  against the  Durrani  (the tribe of Daoud Khan and the previous monarchy). [ 50 ]          Kabul's Queens Palace before the Soviet invasion, as the headquarters of the PDPA.       Once in power, the PDPA moved to permit  freedom of religion  and carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide. They also made a number of statements on  womens rights  and introduced women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous May 28, 1978  New Kabul Times  editorial which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country  Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention. [ 51 ]   Many people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with religiously conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' law.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter ) began to covertly fund forces ranged against the pro-Soviet government, although warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention, (according to National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ). [ 52 ]  The  Mujahideen  belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On September 14, Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     Soviet invasion and civil war       Main articles:  Soviet war in Afghanistan  and  Civil war in Afghanistan       In order to bolster the  Parcham  faction, the Soviet Unionciting the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countriesintervened on December 24, 1979. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100,000 plus and by members of the Parcham faction. Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and part of its overall  Cold War  strategy, the  United States  responded by arming and otherwise supporting the Afghan  mujahideen , which had taken up arms against the Soviet occupiers. U.S. support began during the  Carter  administration, but increased substantially during the  Reagan administration , in which it became a centerpiece of the so-called  Reagan Doctrine  under which the U.S. provided support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan and also in  Angola ,  Nicaragua , and other nations. In addition to U.S. support, the mujahideen received support from  Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and other nations.   The Soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians. Over five million  Afghans  fled their country to Pakistan, Iran and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989.    The Soviet withdrawal from the DRA was seen as an ideological victory in the U.S., which had backed the Mujahideen through three U.S. presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich  Persian Gulf .   Following the removal of the Soviet forces, the U.S. and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. [ citation needed ]  The  USSR  continued to support President  Najibullah  (former head of the Afghan secret service,  KHAD ) until 1992 when the new Russian government refused to sell oil products to the Najibullah regime. [ 53 ]   Because of the fighting, a number of elites and intellectuals fled to take refuge abroad. This led to a leadership imbalance in Afghanistan. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, which gave rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. It was at this time that the  Taliban  developed as a politico-religious force, eventually seizing Kabul in 1996 and establishing the  Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . By the end of 2000 the Taliban had captured 95% of the country.   During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. [ 54 ]  Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. [ 55 ]  The majority of the opium production was eradicated by 2001.

Current President Hamid Karzai reviewing the Presidential Guard in Kabul.       Following the  September 11 attacks  the United States launched  Operation Enduring Freedom , a military campaign to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The U.S. military also threatened to overthrow the Taliban government for refusing to hand over  Osama bin Laden  and several al-Qaida members. The U.S. made a common cause with the former Afghan Mujahideen to achieve its ends, including the  Northern Alliance , a militia still recognized by the  UN  as the Afghan government.   In late 2001, the United States sent teams of CIA Paramilitary Officers from their  Special Activities Division  and U.S. Army Special Forces to invade Afghanistan to aid anti-Taliban militias, backed by U.S. air strikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda targets, culminating in the seizure of Kabul by the Northern Alliance and the overthrow of the Taliban, with many local warlords switching allegiance from the Taliban to the Northern Alliance. [ 57 ]   In December of the same year, leaders of the former Afghan mujahideen and diaspora met in Germany, and agreed on a  plan  for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of  Hamid Karzai , an ethnic Pashtun of the Durrani clan (from which the royal family was drawn) from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the  Afghan Interim Authority .   After a nationwide  Loya Jirga  in 2002, Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim President of Afghanistan. The country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) in 2003 and a new  constitution  was ratified in January 2004. Following an election in October 2004, Hamid Karzai won and became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly  the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973  sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.   As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor  infrastructure , large concentration of  land mines  and other unexploded ordnance, as well as a huge illegal  poppy  cultivation and  opium  trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the  Taliban insurgency  and the threat of attacks from a few remaining al Qaeda.   At the start of 2007 reports of the Taliban's increasing presence in Afghanistan led the U.S. to consider longer tours of duty and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007, U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions. Also, The number of insurgent attacks is up 300 percent since September, 2006, when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters.     See also:  Timeline of the history of Afghanistan  and  Invasions of Afghanistan       Government and politics       Main article:  Politics of Afghanistan       Politics in Afghanistan has historically consisted of power struggles, bloody  coups  and unstable transfers of power. With the exception of a  military junta , the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a  monarchy ,  republic ,  theocracy  and  communist state . The constitution ratified by the  2003 Loya jirga  restructured the government as an  Islamic republic  consisting of three branches, ( executive ,  legislature  and  judiciary ).   Afghanistan is currently led by President  Hamid Karzai , who was elected in October 2004. The current  parliament  was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members, communists,  reformists , and  Islamic fundamentalists . 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3 points more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, long known under the Taliban for its  oppression of women , one of the leading countries in terms of female representation. Construction for a new parliament building began on August 29, 2005.   The  Supreme Court of Afghanistan  is currently led by Chief Justice  Abdul Salam Azimi , a former university professor who had been legal advisor to the president. [ 58 ]  The previous court, appointed during the time of the interim government, had been dominated by fundamentalist religious figures, including Chief Justice  Faisal Ahmad Shinwari . The court issued several rulings, such as banning  cable television , seeking to ban a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and limiting the rights of women, as well as overstepping its constitutional authority by issuing rulings on subjects not yet brought before the court. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more  technocrats  than the previous court, although it has yet to issue any rulings.

Main articles:  Law enforcement in Afghanistan  and  Military of Afghanistan       Afghanistan currently has more than 70,000  national police  officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 80,000. They are being trained by and through the  Afghanistan Police Program . Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, sometimes local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners. In 2003 the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, now under command of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) was extended and expanded beyond the  Kabul  area. However, in some areas unoccupied by those forces, local militias maintain control. In many areas, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police and/or communications. Troops of the  Afghan National Army  have been sent to quell fighting in some regions lacking police protection. [ 59 ]   The  Afghan National Army  currently has 80,000 troops, with plans to nearly double in the next few years. The Afghan Army is not affected by corruption as the National Police due to international oversight.     Administrative divisions       Main articles:  Provinces of Afghanistan  and  Districts of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is administratively divided into thirty-four (34)  provinces  ( welayats ), and for each province there is a capital. Each province is then divided into many provincial  districts , and each district normally covers a city or several  townships .   The  Governor  of the province is appointed by the  Ministry of Interior , and the  Prefects  for the districts of the province will be appointed by the provincial Governor. The Governor is the representative of the central government of Afghanistan, and is responsible for all administrative and formal issues. The provincial  Chief of Police  is appointed by the Ministry of Interior, who works together with the Governor on law enforcement for all the cities or districts of that province.

Therefore, relations between Afghanistan and NATO members is strong. Afghanistan depends a lot on multi-billion dollar aid infusions from the United States. Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany are also large donors.   Relations between Afghanistan and the  Islamic Republic of Iran  are very strong. The two nations share the same language and culture, and both countries are part of  Greater Persia . Shiites and Sunnis get a long well in Afghanistan which causes no religious tensions between the two nations. Iran is a consistent donor towards Afghan reconstruction.   Afghan and Pakistani relations always fluctuate. The two nations are always disputing, but recent relations have deteriorated vastly. Afghan Intelligence and American agencies accuse Pakistan of working to stop Afghan reconstruction mainly through the  Inter-Services Intelligence . Most of the Taliban come from Pakistan and Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Pakistan. Afghanistan and Pakistan recently fought a series of border skirmishes and the US has lead several air strikes in Pakistani territory from Afghan air bases.   Afghanistan maintains excellent relations with their Northern Allies, including  Uzbekistan ,  Tajikistan  and  Turkmenistan  as all three share a similar culture as the Afghans.  Hazaras  are from those nations.   Afghanistan also has good relations with Russia and India. India is a leading investor in Afghanistan, alongside Iran, and the current Afghan President, Hamid Karzai received some of his college education in India.   Afghanistan has excellent relations with the rest of the Arab and  Muslim world . Afghanistan has no relations with Israel and alongside ally Iran, is a frequent non-Arab critic of Israel.     Demographics       Main article:  Demography of Afghanistan       Further information:  Refugees of Afghanistan   A July 2008 estimate of the total Afghan population is 32,738,376.

The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size,  Kandahar ,  Herat ,  Mazar-e Sharif ,  Jalalabad ,  Ghazni  and  Kunduz .     Ethnic groups   The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are not available. [ 61 ]  Therefore most figures are approximations only:           Ethnic groups of Afghanistan )        36.4% to 42.0%  Pashtun         27% to 38.0%  Tajik         8.0% to 10.0%  Hazara         6.0% to 9.2%  Uzbek          0.1% to 4%  Aimak         1.7 to 3%  Turkmen         0.5% to 4%  Baloch          1.9% to 9.2% other ( Pashai ,  Hindki ,  Nuristani ,  Brahui ,  Hindkowans , etc.)               Languages of Afghanistan   (percentages are from  CIA World Factbook ) [ 1 ]         50%  Dari (Eastern Persian)         35%  Pashto         8%  Uzbek         3%  Turkmen         4%  Balochi         2% other ( Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui , etc.)             (1) Based on official census numbers from the 1960s to the 1980s, as well as information found in mainly scholarly sources, the  Encyclopdia Iranica [ 62 ]  gives the following list:     39.4% Pashtun   33.7% Tajik,  Farsiwan , and  Qezelbash   8.0% Hazara   8.0% Uzbek   4.1% Aimak   3.3% Turkmen   1.6% Baloch   1.9% other           (2) An approximate distribution of ethnic groups based on the  CIA World Factbook [ 1 ]  is as following:     Pashtun: 42%   Tajik: 27%   Hazara: 9%   Uzbek: 9%   Aimak: 4%   Turkmen: 3%   Baloch : 2%   Other: 4%                             (3) According to a representative survey, named  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , a combined project of  The Asia Foundation , the  Indian   Centre for the Study of Developing Societies  (CSDS) and the  Afghan Center for Socio-economic and Opinion Research  (ACSOR), the distribution of the ethnic groups is: [ 63 ]     40.9% Pashtun   37.1% Tajik   9.2% Hazara   9.2% Uzbek   1.7% Turkmen   0.5% Baloch   0.1% Aimak   1.3% other           (4) According to another representative survey, named  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand"" , a combined effort by the American broadcasting channel  ABC News , the British  BBC , and the German  ARD  (from the years 2004 to 2009), and released on February 9th 2009, the ethnic composition of the country is (avarege numbers): [ 64 ]     41% Pashtun   38% Tajik   10% Hazara   6% Uzbek   2% Turkmen   1% Nuristani   1% Baloch   1% other                         Languages       Main articles:  Languages of Afghanistan ,  Persian language , and  Pashto language       The most common languages spoken in Afghanistan are  Eastern Persian  (also known as Dari; roughly 50%) and Pashto (roughly 35%). Both are  Indo-European languages  from the  Iranian languages  sub-family, and the  official languages  of the country.  Hazaragi , spoken by the Hazara minority, is a distinct dialect of Persian. Other languages spoken include the  Turkic languages   Uzbek  and  Turkmen  (ca. 9% combined), as well as 30 minor languages, primarily  Balochi ,  Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui ,  Pamiri languages ,  Hindko , etc. (ca. 4% combined).  Bilingualism  is common.   According to the Encyclopdia Iranica, [ 65 ]  the Persian language is the most widely used language of the country, spoken by around 80% of the population, while Pashto is spoken and understood by around 50% of the population. According to  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , [ 63 ]  Persian is the first language of 49% of the population, while additional 37% speak the language as a second language (combined 86%). Pashto is the first language of 40% of the population, while additional 27% know the language (combined 67%). Uzbek is spoken or understood by 6% of the population, Turkmen by 3%. According to the survey  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand""  (avarege numbers from 2005-2009), 69% of the interviewed people preferred Persian, while 31% spoke Pashto. [ 64 ]     Culture       Main article:  Culture of Afghanistan       Afghans display pride in their religion, country, ancestry, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their  clan  loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. [ 66 ]  As clan warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.   Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of Buddha in the Bamyan Province were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as  idolatrous . Other famous sites include the cities of  Kandahar , Heart, Ghazni and Balkh. The Minaret of Jam, in the  Hari River  valley, is a  UNESCO World Heritage site . The cloak worn by  Muhammad  is stored inside the famous Khalka Sharifa in Kandahar City.   Buzkashi  is a national sport in Afghanistan. It is similar to  polo  and played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a  goat  carcass.  Afghan hounds  (a type of running  dog ) also originated in Afghanistan.   Although literacy levels are very low, classic  Persian poetry  plays a very important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in  Iran  and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Persian culture has, and continues to, exert a great influence over Afghan culture. Private poetry competition events known as mushaera are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every homeowner owns one or more poetry collections of some sort, even if they are not read often.   The eastern dialects of the Persian language are popularly known as ""Dari"". The name itself derives from ""Prs-e Darbr"", meaning  Persian of the royal courts . The ancient term  Dar   one of the original names of the Persian language  was revived in the Afghan constitution of 1964, and was intended ""to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language. Hence, the name  Frs , the language of  Frs , is strictly avoided."" [ 67 ]          Girls in Kabul, wearing their traditional clothes, sing at a celebration of International Women's Day       in 2002.]]   Many of the famous  Persian poets  of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from Khorasan where is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy.     Mawln Rumi , who was born and educated in Balkh in the thirteenth century and moved to  Konya  in modern-day  Turkey   Rabi'a Balkhi  (the first poetess in the History of Persian Poetry, tenth century, native of Balkh)   Daqiqi Balkhi  (tenth century, native of Balkh)   Farrukhi Sistani  (tenth century, the  Ghaznavids  royal poet)   Unsuri Balkhi  (a tenth/eleventh century poet, native of Balkh)   Khwaja Abdullah Ansari  (eleventh century, from Herat)   Nasir Khusraw  (eleventh century, from Qubadyan near Balkh)   Anvari  (twelfth century, lived and died in Balkh)   San' Ghaznawi  (twelfth century, native of Ghazni)   Jm of Hert  (fifteenth century, native of Herat in western Afghanistan), and his nephew Abdullah Hatifi Herawi, a well-known poet   Al Sher Nav'  (fifteenth century, Herat).     Most of these individuals were of Persian ( Tjk ) ethnicity who still form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-known in Persian-speaking world, include  Khalilullah Khalili , [ 68 ]  Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari, [ 69 ]  Sarwar Joya,  Parwin Pazwak  and others. In 2003, Khaled Hosseini published The  Kite Runner  which though fiction, captured much of the history, politics and culture experienced in Afghanistan from the 1930s to present day.   In addition to poets and authors, numerous  Persian scientists  were born or worked in the region of present-day Afghanistan. Most notable was  Avicenna  (Abu Al Hussein ibn Sn) whose father hailed from Balkh. Ibn Sn, who travelled to  Isfahan  later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as ""the father of modern medicine"". George Sarton called ibn Sn ""the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times."" His most famous works are  The Book of Healing  and  The Canon of Medicine , also known as the Qanun. Ibn Sn's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through  Noah Gordon 's  The Physician , now published in many languages. Moreover, according to  Ibn al-Nadim ,  Al-Farabi , a well-known philosopher and scientist, was from the Faryab Province of Afghanistan.   Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the  Nauroz -celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the twentieth century has been likened to  Vienna  during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.   The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is potent in political terms. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, they would assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders. In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call.   Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. [ 66 ]     Religions       Main article:  Religion in Afghanistan       Religiously, Afghans are over 99%  Muslims : approximately 74-80%  Sunni  and 19-25%  Shi'a [ 1 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  (estimates vary). Up until the mid-1980s, there were about 30,000 to 150,000  Hindus  and  Sikhs  living in different cities, mostly in  Jalalabad ,  Kabul , and  Kandahar . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]   There was a small  Jewish  community in Afghanistan ( see  Bukharan Jews ) who fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual,  Zablon Simintov , remains today. [ 74 ]     Economy       Main article:  Economy of Afghanistan       Afghanistan is a member of the  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ,  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  and the  Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) . It is an impoverished country, one of the world's poorest and least developed. Two-thirds of the population lives on fewer than 2  US  dollars a day. Its economy has suffered greatly from the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 19982001. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). As of 2005, the official unemployment rate is at 40%. [ 77 ]  The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. [ 78 ]   The nation's economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion  US dollars  in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats. [ 79 ]  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.   The real value of  non-drug  GDP increased by 29% in 2002, 16% in 2003, 8% in 2004 and 14% in 2005. [ 80 ]  As much as one-third of Afghanistan's  GDP  comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including  opium  and its two derivatives,  morphine  and  heroin , as well as  hashish  production. [ 1 ]   Opium production in Afghanistan  has soared to a new record in 2007, with an increase on last year of more than a third, the United Nations has said. [ 81 ]  Some 3.3 million Afghans are now involved in producing opium. [ 82 ]  In a recent article in the  Washington Quarterly , Peter van Ham and Jorrit Kamminga argue that the international community should establish a pilot project and investigate a licensing scheme to start the production of medicines such as morphine and codeine from poppy crops to help it escape the economic dependence on opium: [ 83 ]   According to a 2004 report by the  Asian Development Bank , the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development. [ 78 ]  In 2006, two U.S. companies, Black & Veatch and the  Louis Berger Group , have won a US 1.4 billion dollar contract to rebuild roads, power lines and water supply systems of Afghanistan. [ 84 ]   One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 4 million refugees from neighbouring countries and the  West , who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. What is also helping is the estimated US 23 billion dollars in international assistance every year, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. Private developments are also beginning to get underway. In 2006, a Dubai-based Afghan family opened a $25 million  Coca Cola  bottling plant in Afghanistan. [ 85 ]   While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion  about 15%  is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the  United Nations  system and  non-governmental organizations . The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.   Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the Afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old Afghani by 1 new Afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003. [ 78 ]   The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels. Since 2003, over sixteen new banks have opened in the country, including  Afghanistan International Bank ,  Kabul Bank ,  Azizi Bank ,  Standard Chartered Bank ,  First Micro Finance Bank , and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year  tax holidays  to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports  tariffs  and duties.   Some private investment projects, backed with national support, are also beginning to pick up steam in Afghanistan. An initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr.  Hisham N. Ashkouri , Principal of ARCADD, Inc. for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue, [ 86 ]  revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the  Afghan National Museum .   According to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to 36 trillion cubic feet (1,000 km 3 ) of  natural gas , 3.6 billion barrels (570,000,000 m 3 ) of  petroleum  and up to 1,325 million barrels (2.107E+8 m 3 ) of  natural gas liquids . This could mark the turning point in Afghanistans reconstruction efforts. Energy exports could generate the revenue that Afghan officials need to modernize the countrys infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for the beleaguered and fractious population. [ 27 ]  Other reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal,  iron ore  and other  minerals . [ 24 ] [ 28 ] [ 87 ]  The government of Afghanistan is in the process of extracting and exporting its copper reserves, which will be earning $1.2 billion US dollars in  royalties  and taxes every year for the next 30 years. It will also provide permanent labor to 3,000 of its citizens.

International flights include to  Dubai ,  Frankfurt ,  Istanbul  and a number of other destinations. [ citation needed ]  There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from  Kam Air ,  Pamir Airways  and Safi Airlines.   The country has limited rail service with Turkmenistan. There are two  railway  projects currently in progress, one is between Herat and the Iranian city  Mashad  while another is between Kandahar and  Quetta  in Pakistan. Most people who travel from one city to another use bus services. Automobiles have recently become more widely available, with  Toyota ,  Nissan  and  Hyundai  dealerships in Kabul. A large number of second-hand vehicles are also arriving from the  UAE . Nearly all highways and roads are being rebuilt in the country.     Communications and technology       Main article:  Communications in Afghanistan       Telecommunication services in the country are provided by  Afghan Wireless ,  Etisalat ,  Roshan ,  Areeba  and  Afghan Telecom . In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a  US$ 64.5 million agreement with  ZTE Corporation  for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country. [ 89 ]  Around 500,000 (1.5% of the population) had internet access by the end of 2008. [ 90 ]   Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.   The nation's post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as  FedEx ,  DHL  and others are also available.     Media       Main article:  Media of Afghanistan       The media was tightly controlled under the  Taliban  and other periods in its history, and was relatively free in others. Under the Taliban, television was shut down in 1996, and print media were forbidden to publish commentary, photos or readers letters. [ 91 ]  The only radio station broadcast religious programmes and  propaganda , and aired no music. [ 91 ]   After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified.  Freedom of expression  and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and  censorship  is banned, though  defaming  individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of  Islam  is prohibited. In 2008,  Reporters Without Borders  listed the media environment as 156 out of 173, with 1st being most free. [ 92 ]  400 publications are now registered and 60 radio stations, a major source of information, currently exist. [ 93 ]  Foreign radio stations, such as the  BBC World Service , also broadcast into the country. However,  press freedom  is threatened by the continuing  war in Afghanistan , with kidnappings of journalists, harassment and death threats.     Education       Main article:  Education in Afghanistan       As of 2006 more than four million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout the country. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. A lack of women teachers is an issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men. [ 94 ]   Literacy of the entire population is estimated (as of 1999) at 36%, the male literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. Up to now there are 9,500 schools in the country.   Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of  higher education . Following the fall of the Taliban,  Kabul University  was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the  American University of Afghanistan  also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The university accepts students from Afghanistan and the neighboring countries. Construction work will soon start at the new site selected for  University of Balkh  in Mazari Sharif. The new building for the university, including the building for the Engineering Department, would be constructed at  600 acres (2.4 km)  of land at the cost of 250 million US dollars. [ 95 ]   A new military school is in function to properly train and educate Afghan soldiers.     Images of Afghanistan             This section seems to be an image gallery .

A landlocked country of southwest-central Asia. Since ancient times the region has been crisscrossed by invaders, including Persians, Macedonians, Arabs, Turks, and Mongols. Afghan tribes united in the 18th century under a single leadership, but a fully independent state did not emerge until 1919. Kabul is the capital and the largest city.

Area: 249,347 sq mi (645,807 sq km). Population (2005 est.: 23,867,000). Capital:  Kabul . About two-fifths of the people belong to the Pashtun ethnic group; other ethnic groups include Tajiks, Uzbeks, and  H az a ra. Languages: Pashto, Persian (both official). Religions: Islam (official; predominantly Sunni); also Zoroastrianism. Currency: afghani. Afghanistan has three distinctive regions: the northern plains are the major agricultural area; the southwestern plateau consists primarily of desert and semiarid landscape; and the central highlands, including the  Hindu Kush , separate these regions. Afghanistan has a developing economy based largely on agriculture; its significant mineral resources remain largely untapped because of the  Afghan War  of the 1980s and subsequent fighting. Traditional handicrafts remain important; woolen carpets are a major export. The area was part of the Persian Achaemenian Empire in the 6th century  BC  and was conquered by  Alexander the Great  in the 4th century  BC . Hindu influence entered with the Hephthalites and  S a s a nian s; Islam became entrenched during the rule of the  S aff a rids,  c.   AD  870. Afghanistan was divided between the  Mughal  Empire of India and the  S afavid  empire of Persia until the 18th century, when other Persians under  N a dir Shah  took control. Britain fought several wars in the area in the 19th century. From the 1930s the country had a stable monarchy, which was overthrown in the 1970s. Marxist reforms sparked rebellion, and Soviet troops invaded. Afghan guerrillas prevailed, and the Soviets withdrew in 1989. In 1992 rebel factions overthrew the government and established an Islamic republic. In 1996 the  Taliban  militia took power in Kabul and enforced a harsh Islamic order. The militia's unwillingness to extradite extremist leader  Osama bin Laden  and members of his al-Qaeda militant organization following the  September 11 attacks  in 2001 led to military conflict with the U.S. and allied nations, the overthrow of the Taliban, and the establishment of an interim government.

Afghanistan is bordered by Iran on the west, by Pakistan on the east and south, and by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan on the north; a narrow strip, the Vakhan (Wakhan), extends in the northeast along Pakistan to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. The capital and largest city is  Kabul . Land and People The great mass of the country is steep-sloped with mountains, the ranges fanning out from the towering Hindu Kush (reaching a height of more than 24,000 ft/7,315 m) across the center of the country. There are, however, within the mountain ranges and on their edges, many fertile valleys and plains. In the south, and particularly in the southwest, are great stretches of desert, including the regions of Seistan and Registan. To the north, between the central mountain chains (notably the Selseleh-ye Kuh-e Baba, or Koh-i-Baba, and the Paropamisus) and the Amu Darya (Oxus) River, which marks part of the northern boundary, are the highlands of Badakhshan (with the finest lapis lazuli in the world), Afghan Turkistan, the Amu Darya plain, and the rich valley of  Herat  on the Hari Rud (Arius) River in the northwest corner of the country (the heart of ancient  Ariana ). The regions thus vary widely, although most of the land is dry. The rivers are mostly unnavigable; the longest is the Helmand, which flows generally southwest from the Hindu Kush to the Iranian border. Its water has been used since remote times for irrigation, as have the waters of the Hari Rud and of the Amu Darya. The Kabul River, beside which the capital stands, is particularly famous because it leads to the Khyber Pass and thus S to Pakistan. Although warfare in Afghanistan during the late 20th cent. caused substantial population displacement, with millions of refugees fleeing into Pakistan and Iran, regional ethnicity remains generally the same as it had been before the unrest. Tajiks live around Herat and in the northeast; Uzbeks live in the north, and nomadic Turkmen live along the Turkmenistan border. In the central mountains are the Hazaras, of Mongolian origin. In the eastern and south central portions Afghans (or Pashtuns), who make up the country's largest ethnic group, are dominant, and Baluchis live in the extreme south. Dari (Afghan Persian), Pashto (Afghan), and various Turkic tongues (mainly Uzbek and Turkmen) are the country's principal languages. A unifying factor is religion, almost all the inhabitants being Muslim; the large majority (about 80%) are Sunni, the minority Shiite. In addition to Kabul, important cities include  Kandahar , Herat, and  Jalalabad . Economy Agriculture is the main occupation, although less than 10% of the land is cultivated; a large percentage of the arable land was damaged by warfare during the 1980s and 90s. Largely subsistence crops include wheat and other grains, fruits, and nuts. The opium poppy, grown mainly for the international illegal drug trade, is the most important cash crop, and the country is the world's largest producer of opium. Grazing is also of great importance in the economy. The fat-tailed sheep are a staple of Afghan life, supplying skins and wool for clothing and meat and fat for food. Mineral wealth is virtually undeveloped, except for natural gas. There are deposits of coal, copper, chromite, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, emeralds, and lapis lazuli; oil fields are found in the north. Some small-scale manufactures produce cotton and other fabrics, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, and processed agricultural goods. Extremely high levels of unemploymentabout 40% in 2005have resulted from the general collapse of Afghanistan's industry. Opium, fruits and nuts, handwoven carpets, wool, cotton, lambskins (Karakul), and gemstones are the main exports; capital goods, foodstuffs, textiles and other manufactured goods, and petroleum products are the main imports. As a result of civil war, exports have dwindled to a minimum, except for the illegal trade in opium and hashish. The country has also become an important producer of heroin, which is derived from opium. Afghanistan is heavily dependent on international assistance. The main trading partners are Pakistan, the United States, and India. Road communications throughout the country are poor, although existing roads have undergone reconstruction since the end of Taliban rule; pack animals are an important means of transport in the interior. A road and tunnel under the Salang pass, built (1964) by the Russians, provides a short, all-weather route between N and S Afghanistan. Government Afghanistan is governed under the constitution of 2004. The president, who is both head of state and of government, is popularly elected for a five-year term and may serve a second term. The president appoints a cabinet, the members of which must be approved by the legislature. The bicameral legislature is called the National Assembly. The lower house, the House of the People (Wolesi Jirga), consists of no more than 249 members, who are directly elected to five-year terms. The upper house, the House of Elders (Meshrano Jirga), consists of 102 members, a third elected by provincial councils to four-year terms, a third elected by district councils to three-year terms, and the rest (half of whom must be women) appointed by the president to five-year terms. No law passed by the Assembly may be contrary to Islam. Administratively, the country is divided into 34 provinces. History Early History The location of Afghanistan astride the land routes between the Indian subcontinent, Iran, and central Asia has enticed conquerors throughout history. Its high mountains, although hindering unity, helped the hill tribes to preserve their independence. It is probable that there were well-developed civilizations in S Afghanistan in prehistoric times, but the archaeological record is not clear. Certainly cultures had flourished in the north and east before the Persian king Darius I (c.500  B.C. ) conquered these areas. Later, Alexander the Great conquered (329327  B.C. ) them on his way to India. After Alexander's death (323  B.C. ) the region at first was part of the Seleucid empire. In the north,  Bactria  became independent, and the south was acquired by the  Maurya  dynasty. Bactria expanded southward but fell (mid-2d cent.  B.C. ) to the Parthians and rebellious tribes (notably the Saka). Buddhism was introduced from the east by the Yechi, who founded the Kushan dynasty (early 2d cent.  B.C. ). Their capital was  Peshawar . The Kushans declined (3d cent.  A.D. ) and were supplanted by the  Sassanids , the Ephthalites, and the Turkish Tu-Kuie. The Muslim conquest of Afghanistan began in the 7th cent. Several short-lived Muslim dynasties were founded, the most powerful of them having its capital at Ghazna (see  Ghazni ).  Mahmud of Ghazna , who conquered the lands from Khorasan in Iran to the Punjab in India early in the 11th cent., was the greatest of Afghanistan's rulers. Jenghiz Khan (c.1220) and Timur (late 14th cent.) were subsequent conquerors of renown.  Babur , a descendant of Timur, used Kabul as the base for his conquest of India and the establishment of the Mughal empire in the 16th cent. In the 18th cent. the Persian  Nadir Shah  extended his rule to N of the Hindu Kush. After his death (1747) his lieutenant,  Ahmad Shah , an Afghan tribal leader, established a united state covering most of present-day Afghanistan. His dynasty, the Durrani, gave the Afghans the name (Durrani) that they themselves frequently use. The Afghan Wars and Independence The reign of the Durrani line ended in 1818, and no predominant ruler emerged until  Dost Muhammad  became emir in 1826. During his rule the status of Afghanistan became an international problem, as Britain and Russia contested for influence in central Asia. Aiming to control access to the northern approaches to India, the British tried to replace Dost Muhammad with a former emir, subordinate to them. This policy caused the first Afghan War (183842) between the British and the Afghans. Dost Muhammad was at first deposed but, after an Afghan revolt in Kabul, was restored. In 1857, Dost Muhammad signed an alliance with the British. He died in 1863 and was succeeded, after familial fighting, by his third son,  Sher Ali . As the Russians acquired territory bordering on the Amu Darya, Sher Ali and the British quarreled, and the second Afghan War began (1878). Sher Ali died in 1879. His successor, Yakub Khan, ceded the Khyber Pass and other areas to the British, and after a British envoy was murdered the British occupied Kabul. Eventually  Abd ar-Rahman Khan  was recognized (1880) as emir. In the following years Afghanistan's borders were more precisely defined. Border agreements were reached with Russia (1885 and 1895), British India (the Durand Agreement, 1893), and Persia (1905). The Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 guaranteed the independence of Afghanistan under British influence in foreign affairs. Abd ar-Rahman Khan died in 1901 and was succeeded by his son Habibullah. Despite British pressure, Afghanistan remained neutral in World War I. Habibullah was assassinated in 1919. His successor,  Amanullah , attempting to free himself of British influence, invaded India (1919). This third Afghan War was ended by the Treaty of Rawalpindi, which gave Afghanistan full control over its foreign relations. Attempts at Modernization and Reform The attempts of Amanullah (who, after 1926, styled himself king) at Westernizationincluding reducing the power of the country's religious leaders and increasing the freedom of its womenprovoked opposition that led to his deposition in 1929. A tribal leader, Bacha-i Saqao, held Kabul for a few months until defeated by Amanullah's cousin, Muhammad Nadir Khan, who became King Nadir Shah. The new king pursued cautious modernization efforts until he was assassinated in 1933. His son Muhammad Zahir Shah succeeded him. Afghanistan was neutral in World War II; it joined the United Nations in 1946. When British India was partitioned (1947), Afghanistan wanted the Pathans of the North-West Frontier Province, who had been separated from Afghan's Pashtuns by the Durand Agreement of 1893, to be able to choose whether to join Afghanistan, join Pakistan, or be independent. The Pathans were only offered the choice of joining Pakistan or joining India; they chose the former. In 1955, Afghanistan urged the creation of an autonomous Pathan state, Pushtunistan (Pakhtunistan). The issue subsided in the late 1960s but was revived by Afghanistan in 1972 when Pakistan was weakened by the loss of its eastern wing (now Bangladesh) and the war with India. In great-power relations, Afghanistan was neutral until the late 1970s, receiving aid from both the United States and the Soviet Union. In the early 1970s the country was beset by serious economic problems, particularly a severe long-term drought in the center and north. Maintaining that King Muhammad Zahir Shah had mishandled the economic crisis and in addition was stifling political reform, a group of young military officers deposed (July, 1973) the king and proclaimed a republic. Lt. Gen. Sardar Muhammad Daud Khan, the king's cousin, became president and prime minister. In 1978, Daud was deposed by a group led by Noor Mohammed Taraki, who instituted Marxist reforms and aligned the country more closely with the Soviet Union. In Sept., 1979, Taraki was killed and Hafizullah Amin took power. Shortly thereafter, the USSR sent troops into Afghanistan, Amin was executed, and the Soviet-supported Babrak Karmal became president. The Afghanistan War and Islamic Fundamentalism In the late 1970s the government faced increasing popular opposition to its social policies. By 1979 guerrilla opposition forces, popularly called mujahidin (Islamic warriors), were active in much of the country, fighting both Soviet forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government. In 1986, Karmal resigned and was replaced by Mohammad Najibullah. The country was devastated by the  Afghanistan War  (197989), which took an enormous human and economic toll. After the Soviet withdrawal, the government steadily lost ground to the guerrilla forces. In early 1992, Kabul was captured, and the guerrilla alliance set up a new government consisting of a 50-member ruling council. Burhanuddin Rabbani was named interim president. The victorious guerrillas proved unable to unite, however, and the forces of guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar launched attacks on the new government. As fighting among various factions continued, Afghanistan was in effect divided into several independent zones, each with its own ruler. Beginning in late 1994 a militia of Pashtun Islamic fundamentalist students, the Taliban, emerged as an increasingly powerful force. In early 1996, as the Taliban continued its attempt to gain control of Afghanistan, Rabbani and Hekmatyar signed a power-sharing accord that made Hekmatyar premier. In September, however, the Taliban captured Kabul and declared themselves the legitimate government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan; they imposed a particularly puritanical form of Islamic law in the two thirds of the country they controlled. In Aug., 1998, as the Taliban appeared on the verge of taking over the whole country, U.S. missiles destroyed what was described by the Pentagon as an extensive terrorist training complex near Kabul run by Osama  bin Laden , a Saudi-born militant accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In Mar., 1999, a UN-brokered peace agreement was reached between the Taliban and their major remaining foe, the forces of the Northern Alliance, under Ahmed Shah Massoud, an ethnic Tajik and former mujahidin leader, but fighting broke out again in July. In November, the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Afghanistan; this action and the 1998 U.S. missile attacks were related to the Afghani refusal to turn over bin Laden. Additional UN sanctions, including a ban on arms sales to Taliban forces, were imposed in Dec., 2000. The Taliban controlled some 90% of the country by 2000, but their government was not generally recognized by the international community (the United Nations recognized President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the Northern Alliance). Continued warfare had caused over a million deaths, while 3 million Afghans remained in Pakistan and Iran as refugees. Adding to the nation's woe, a drought in W and central Asia that began in the late 1990s was most severe in Afghanistan. In early 2001 the Taliban militia destroyed all statues in the nation, including two ancient giant Buddhas in  Bamian , outside Kabul. The destruction was ordered by religious leaders, who regarded the figures as idolatrous and un-Islamic; the action was met with widespread international dismay and condemnation, even from other Islamic nations. In September, in a severe blow to the Northern Alliance, Massoud died as a result of a suicide bomb attack by assassins posing as Arab journalists. Two days after that attack, devastating terrorist assaults on the  World Trade Center  and the  Pentagon , which bin Laden was apparently involved in planning, prompted new demands by U.S. President Bush for his arrest. When the Taliban refused to hand bin Laden over, the United States launched (Oct., 2001) attacks against Taliban and Al Qaeda (bin Laden's organization) positions and forces. The United States also began providing financial aid and other assistance to the Northern Alliance and other opposition groups. Assisted by U.S. air strikes, opposition forces ousted Taliban and Al Qaeda forces from Afghanistan's major urban areas in November and December, often aided by the defection of forces allied with the Taliban. Several thousand U.S. troops began entering the country in November, mainly to concentrate on the search for bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar and to deal with the remaining pockets of their forces. In early December a pan-Afghan conference in Bonn, Germany, appointed Hamid  Karzai , a Pashtun with ties to the former king, as the nation's interim leader, replacing President Rabbani. By Jan., 2002, the Taliban and Al Qaeda were largely defeated, although most of their leaders and unknown numbers of their forces remained at large. Fighting continued on a sporadic basis, with occasional real battles, as occurred near Gardez in Mar., 2002. The country itself largely reverted to the control of the regional warlords who held power before the Taliban. Britain, Canada, and other NATO nations provided forces for various military, peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations. Many other nations also agreed to contribute humanitarian aid; the United Nations estimated that $15 billion would be needed over the next 10 years to rebuild Afghanistan. The former king, Muhammad Zahir Shah, returned to the country from exile to convene (June, 2002) a loya jirga (a traditional Afghan grand council) to establish a transitional government. Karzai was elected president (for a two-year term), and the king was declared the father of the nation. That Karzai and his cabinet faced many challenges was confirmed violently in the following months when one of his vice presidents was assassinated and an attempt was made on Karzai's life. Nonetheless, by the end of 2002 the country had achieved a measure of stability. Sporadic, generally small-scale fighting with various guerrillas has continued, particularly in the southeast, with the Taliban regaining some strength and even control in certain districts. There also has been fighting between rival factions in various parts of the country. Reconstruction has proceeded slowly, and central governmental control outside Kabul remained almost nonexistent. A return to economic health also was hindered by a persistent drought that continued through 2004. In Aug., 2003, NATO assumed command of the international security force in the Kabul area. A new constitution was approved in Jan., 2004, by a loya jirga. It provides for a strong executive presidency and contains some concessions to minorities, but tensions between the dominant Pashtuns and other ethnic groups were evident during the loya jirga. In early 2004 the United States and NATO both announced increases in the number of troops deployed in the country. The U.S. move coincided with new operations against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, while the NATO forces were slated to be used to provide security and in reconstruction efforts. Further increases in NATO forces, to nearly 9,000, were announced in early 2005. By mid-2004 little of the aid that the United Nations had estimated the country would need had reached Afghanistan, while a new, Afghani-proposed development plan called for $28.5 billion over seven years. Although foreign nations pledged to provide substantial monies for three years, sufficient forces and funding for Afghan security were not included. Karzai was elected to the presidency in Oct., 2004, in the country's first democratic elections. The vote, which generally split along ethnic lines, was peaceful, but it was marred by some minor difficulties. Several losing candidates accused Karzai of fraud, but an international review panel said the irregularities that had occurred were not significant enough to have affected the outcome. Karzai's new cabinet consisted largely of technocrats and was ethnically balanced, although Pashtuns generally held the more important posts. The spring of 2005 was marked by an increase in attacks by the Taliban and their allies. Reports of the possible desecration of the Qur'an by U.S. interregators at Guantanamo, when Afghan prisoners were held by the United States, provoked protests and riots in a number of Afghan cities and towns in May, 2005. The protests were largely in the country's south and east, where U.S. forces were operating, and were believed to reflect frustration with the U.S. presence there as much as anger over the alleged desecration. National and provincial legislative elections were held in Sept., 2005; in some locales the balloting was marred by fraud. Supporters of Karzai won a substantial number of seats in the lower house (Wolesi Jirga); religious conservatives, former mujahidin and Taliban, women, and Pashtuns (which are overlapping groups) were all elected in significant numbers to the body. Tensions with Pakistan increased in early 2006, as members of the Afghan government increasingly accused Pakistan of failing to control Taliban and Al Qaeda camps in areas bordering Afghanistan; by the end of the year President Karzai had accused elements of the Pakistani government of directly supporting the Taliban. In Jan., 2006, a U.S. airstrike destroyed several houses in E Pakistan where Al Qaeda leaders were believed to be meeting. May, 2006, saw the U.S.-led coalition launch its largest campaign against Taliban forces since 2001; some 11,000 troops undertook a summer offensive in four S Afghan provinces, where the Taliban had become increasingly stronger and entrenched. Also in May a deadly traffic accident in Kabul involving a U.S. convoy sparked anti-American and antigovernment demonstrations and riots in the city. In July, NATO assumed responsibility for peacekeeping in S Afghanistan, taking over from the coalition. NATO troops subsequently found themselves engaged in significant battles with the Taliban, particularly in Kandahar prov. NATO took command of all peacekeeping forces in the country, including some 11,000 U.S. troops, in October; some 8,000 U.S. troops remained part of Operation Enduring Freedom, assigned to fighting Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in mountainous areas bordering Pakistan. In the second half of 2006, as casualties mounted, NATO commanders encountered difficulties when their call for reinforcements failed to raise the necessary number of troops and matriel. NATO leaders also joined Afghan leaders in criticizing Pakistan for failing to end the Taliban's use of areas bordering Afghanistan, especially in Baluchistan, as safe havens. In Mar., 2007, NATO forces launched a new offensive in Helmand prov. against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The same month the National Assembly passed a law granting many Afghans amnesty for human-rights violations committed during the past two-and-a-half decades of civil war. In the spring of 2007, Pakistan's construction of a fence along the border with Afghanistan led to protests from Afghanistan, and sparked several border clashes between the forces of the two countries. (Afghanistan does not officially recognize the modern Pakistan-Afghanistan border.) In May NATO forces killed the top Taliban field commander, Mullah Dadullah, but Taliban forces mounted some guerrilla attacks on the outskirts of the capital during 2007. Also in  2007, Afghan civilian casualties during military operations became a source of anger and concern among Afghans. Although the majority of the Afghan refugees abroad have repatriated since the overthrow of the Taliban, at the beginning of 2007 it was estimated that some 2.1 million Afghanis were still refugees, with most of those in Pakistan and Iran.

Kabul  is its capital and largest city.  The  Soviet Union  invaded Afghanistan in 1979 but met stiff resistance from  Muslim  rebels, called  mujahideen,  who received support from the United States. The Soviets agreed to withdraw in 1986 and completed their withdrawal in 1989. In 1992, various rebel groups entered Kabul and took over the government; however, they soon fell to warring. Between 1994 and 1995, Islamic students, called the  Taliban , seized Kabul and imposed both order and strict and repressive Islamic law. By 1998, the Taliban controlled ninety percent of the country. The most serious resistance to the Taliban came from the Northern Alliance, a body dominated by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks. In October 2001, the United States launched attacks on the Taliban in response to the Taliban's refusal to expel Osama  bin Laden  and his terrorist  Al Qaeda  network. Afghanistan is a poor nation with a history of warfare among its rival ethnic groups and of fierce resistance to outsiders.                              Dialing Code:    Afghanistan       Home  >  Library  >  Travel  >  Dialing Codes - Countries        The international dialing code for  Afghanistan  is:    93                                    Maps:       Afghanistan        Home  >  Library  >  Travel  >  Maps                                     Local Time:    Afghanistan       Home  >  Library  >  Travel  >  Local Time - Countries         Local Time:   Jan 7, 3:25 PM                            Currency:   Afghanistan       Home  >  Library  >  Travel  >  Exchange Rates by Country        Afghanistan Afghani                                                              Statistics:      Afghanistan        Home  >  Library  >  Travel  >  Regional Stats                    Introduction    Background: Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. Subsequently, a series of civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pa

Germany had a difficult time administering the territory, which, owing to the Germans' brutal native policy, experienced many insurrections, especially those led by guerilla leader  Jacob Morenga .   During  World War I , in 1915, the region was taken from German control. After the war it was declared a  League of Nations   Mandate territory  under the  Treaty of Versailles , with  South Africa  responsible for its administration.   The Mandate was supposed to become a  United Nations Trust Territory  when League of Nations Mandates were transferred to the  United Nations  following  World War II , but the  Union of South Africa  refused to agree to allow the territory to begin the transition to independence as it was essentially considered to be a  de facto  fifth province of South Africa, even though it was never actually incorporated into the country. South Africa's stance on its ownership to South-West Africa was due to the fact that she governed the territory for decades and had invested money on its infrastructure and modernization.  Walvis Bay  and the  Penguin islands  had been annexed by  Britain  as part of the  Cape Colony  in 1878, and thus became part of the Union of South Africa in 1910. Administration of Walvis Bay was later transferred by South Africa to SWA in 1922 and then again returned back to the  Cape Province  in 1977.   These South African actions gave rise to several rulings at the  International Court of Justice . In 1950, it ruled that South Africa did not have any obligation to convert South-West Africa to a  United Nations Trust Territory , but was still bound by the League of Nations Mandate with the  United Nations General Assembly  assuming the supervisory role. It also clarified that the General Assembly was empowered to receive petitions from the inhabitants of South-West Africa and to call for reports from the mandatory nation, South Africa. [ 2 ]  The General Assembly constituted the Committee on South-West Africa to perform the supervisory functions. [ 3 ]  In another advisory opinion issued in 1955, the Court further ruled that the General Assembly was not required to follow League of Nations voting procedures in determining questions concerning South-West Africa. [ 4 ]  In 1956, the Court further ruled that the Committee had the power to grant hearings to petitioners from the mandated territory. [ 5 ]  In 1960,  Ethiopia  and  Liberia  filed a case in the  International Court of Justice  against South Africa alleging that South Africa had not fulfilled its mandatory duties. This case did not succeed, with the Court ruling in 1966 that they were not the proper parties to bring the case. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  In 1966, the General Assembly passed resolution 2145 (XXI) which declared the Mandate terminated and that South Africa had no further right to administer South-West Africa. In 1971, acting on a request for advisory opinion from the United Nations Security Council, the International Court of Justice ruled that the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia was illegal and that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw from Namibia immediately. It also ruled that all member states of the United Nations were under an obligation to recognize the invalidity of any act performed by South Africa on behalf of Namibia. [ 8 ]   South-West Africa had been known internationally as Namibia since the United Nations General Assembly changed the territory's name by Resolution 2372 (XXII) of 12 June 1968. [ 9 ]   There was a protracted struggle between South Africa and forces fighting for independence, particularly after the formation of the  South-West Africa People's Organisation  in 1960.   The territory became the independent  Republic of Namibia  in 1990, with  Walvis Bay  only becoming part of Namibia in 1994.     [ edit ]   Bantustans   The South African authorities established 10  bantustans  in Namibia in the late 1960s and early 70s three of which were granted self-rule  [ 10 ] . These bantustans were replaced with separate ethnicity based governments in 1980.

The vestiges of apartheid still shape South African politics and society.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  This stemmed from the regulation of  blacks ' movement from the tribal regions to those occupied by  whites  and  coloureds , ruled by the British. Laws were passed not only to restrict the movement of blacks into these areas, but also to prohibit their movement from one district to another without a signed pass. Blacks were not allowed onto the streets of towns in the Cape Colony and Natal after dark and had to carry their passes at all times.   The Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892 instituted limits based on financial means and education to the black  franchise , and the Natal Legislative Assembly Bill of 1894 deprived Indians of the right to vote. In 1905 the General Pass Regulations Bill denied blacks the vote altogether, limited them to fixed areas and inaugurated the infamous Pass System. Then followed the Asiatic Registration Act (1906) requiring all Indians to register and carry passes, the South Africa Act (1910) that enfranchised whites, giving them complete political control over all other race groups, the Native Land Act (1913) which prevented all blacks, except those in the Cape, from buying land outside ""reserves"", the Natives in Urban Areas Bill (1918) designed to force blacks into ""locations"", the Urban Areas Act (1923) which introduced residential  segregation  and provided cheap labour for white industry, the Colour Bar Act (1926), preventing blacks from practising skilled trades, the Native Administration Act (1927) that made the British Crown, rather than  paramount chiefs , the supreme head over all African affairs, the Native Land and Trust Act (1936) that complemented the 1913 Native Land Act and, in the same year, the Representation of Natives Act, which removed blacks from the Cape voters' roll. The final piece of segregating legislation enacted by the British was the Asiatic Land Tenure Bill (1946), which banned any further land sales to Indians.   Jan Smuts'   United Party  government began to move away from the rigid enforcement of segregationist laws during  World War II . Amid fears integration would eventually lead the nation to racial assimilation, the legislature established the Sauer Commission to investigate the effects of the United Party's policies. The commission concluded integration would bring about a ""loss of personality"" for all  racial groups .     [ edit ]   Institution of apartheid   Following the  general election of 1948 , [ 5 ] , the National Party set in place its programme of Apartheid, with the formalisation and expansion of existing policies and practices into a system of institutionalised racism and white domination. Apartheid legislation classified inhabitants and visitors into  racial groups  (black, white,  coloured , and Indian or Asian).   However,  Werner Eiselen , the man who led the design of apartheid, argued that the government could not sustain segregation and white supremacy. [ citation needed ]  He also, in 1948, proposed apartheid as a ""political partition"" policy instead of segregation in public facilities. Hence, the idea behind apartheid was more one of political separation, later known as ""grand apartheid,"" than segregation, later known as ""petty apartheid.""  Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd  is considered the most influential politician in the growth of apartheid and described it as ""a policy of good neighbourliness"". [ 6 ]   Up until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these  pass  requirements as attempts to introduce  pass laws  for women were met with fierce resistance. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Elections of 1948 and the Group Areas Act          ""Petty apartheid"": sign on Durban beach in  English ,  Afrikaans  and  Zulu  (1989)       In the run-up to the  1948 elections , the main Afrikaner nationalist party, the  Herenigde Nasionale Party  (Reunited National Party) under the leadership of  Protestant  cleric  Daniel Francois Malan , campaigned on its policy of apartheid. The NP narrowly defeated Smuts's United Party and formed a  coalition government  with another Afrikaner nationalist party, the  Afrikaner Party . Malan became the first apartheid prime minister, and the two parties later merged to form the  National Party  (NP). The coalition government immediately began implementing apartheid policies, passing legislation prohibiting  miscegenation  and classifying individuals by race. The  Group Areas Act  of 1950, designed to separate racial groups geographically, became the heart of the apartheid system. The  Separate Amenities Act  was passed in 1953. Under this Act, municipal grounds could be reserved for a particular race. It created, among other things, separate beaches, buses, hospitals, schools and universities. Signboards such as ""whites only"" applied to public areas, even including park benches.   Interracial contact in sport was frowned upon, but there were no segregatory sports laws. The government was able to keep sport segregated using other legislation, such as the Group Areas Act.   The government tightened existing pass laws, compelling black South Africans to carry identity documents to prevent the migration of blacks to 'white' South Africa. For blacks, living in cities required employment. Families were excluded, thus separating wives from husbands and parents from children.

Strijdom , Malan's successor as Prime Minister, moved to strip coloureds and blacks of their voting rights in the Cape Province. The previous government had first introduced the Separate Representation of Voters Bill in parliament in 1951. However, a group of four voters, G Harris, WD Franklin, WD Collins and Edgar Deane, challenged its validity in court with support from the United Party. The Cape Supreme Court upheld the act, but the Appeal Court upheld the appeal, finding the act invalid because a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both Houses of  Parliament  was needed in order to change the  entrenched clauses  of the  Constitution . The government then introduced the High Court of Parliament Bill, which gave parliament the power to overrule decisions of the court. The Cape Supreme Court and the Appeal Court declared this invalid too. In 1955 the Strijdom government increased the number of judges in the Appeal Court from five to eleven, and appointed pro-Nationalist judges to fill the new places. In the same year they introduced the Senate Act, which increased the senate from 49 seats to 89. Adjustments were made such that the NP controlled 77 of these seats. The parliament met in a joint sitting and passed the Separate Representation of Voters act in 1956, which removed coloureds from the common voters' roll in the Cape, and established a separate voters' roll for them.

This box:  view    talk    edit         Main article:  Apartheid legislation in South Africa   From the 1950s onwards, various laws were passed to keep the races apart and suppress resistance. The practice of apartheid retained many of the features of the segregationist policies of earlier administrations. Examples include the 1913 Land Act and the various workplace colour bars.   National Party leaders argued that South Africa did not comprise a single nation, but was made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, coloured and Indian. These groups were split further into thirteen ""nations"" or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups. Legislation had the result of making the white race the dominant one.   The principal "" apartheid laws "" were as follows: [ 8 ]   The  Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act  of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races and the  Immorality Act  of 1950 made  sexual relations with a person of a different race  a  criminal offence .   The  Population Registration Act  of 1950 formalised racial classification and introduced an identity card for all persons over the age of eighteen, specifying their racial group. Also in 1950 the  Group Areas Act  partitioned the country into areas allocated to different racial groups. This law was the basis upon which political and social separation was constructed. The Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 created separate government structures for blacks and was the first piece of legislation established to support the government's plan of separate development in the  Bantustans . Further legislation in 1951 allowed the government to demolish black  shackland  slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in ""white"" cities. The  Reservation of Separate Amenities Act  of 1953 prohibited people of different races from using the same public amenities, such as restaurants, public swimming pools, and  restrooms . Further laws had the aim of suppressing resistance, especially armed resistance, to apartheid. The  Suppression of Communism Act  of 1950 banned the  South African Communist Party  and any other  political party  that the government chose to label as ' communist '. Disorderly gatherings were banned, as were certain organizations that were deemed threatening to the government.   An act of 1956 formalised racial  discrimination  in  employment , while in 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act of 1958 entrenched the National Party's policy of nominally independent ""homelands"" for black people. So-called ""selfgoverning Bantu units"" were proposed, which would have devolved administrative powers, with the promise later of  autonomy  and  self-government . The Bantu Investment Corporation Act of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands in order to create employment there.   In 1953, the  Bantu Education Act  crafted a separate system of education for African students and in 1959 separate universities were created for blacks, coloureds and Indians. Existing universities were not permitted to enroll new black students. Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in ""white"" cites and redirect such development to the ""homelands"". The  Black Homeland Citizenship Act  of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy. It changed the status of the black so that they were no longer citizens of South Africa, but became citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The aim was to ensure whites became the demographic majority within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans choose ""independence"". The Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 required the use of  Afrikaans  and English on an equal basis in high schools outside the homelands. [ 9 ]   To oversee the apartheid legislation, the bureaucracy expanded, and, by 1977, there were more than half a million white state employees.

(January 2008)       Before South Africa became a  republic , white politics was typified by the division between the chiefly- Afrikaans  pro-republicans and the largely English anti-republicans, with the legacy of the  Boer War  still a factor for some people. Once republican status was attained,  Verwoerd  called for improved relations and greater accord between those of British descent and the Afrikaners. He claimed that the only difference now was between those who supported apartheid and those in opposition to it. The ethnic divide would no longer be between Afrikaans speakers and English speakers, but rather white and black. Most Afrikaners supported the notion of white unanimity to ensure their safety. Whites of British descent were divided. Many had voted in opposition to a republic, especially in  Natal , where most votes said ""No"". Later, however, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which left them apprehensive.  Harold Macmillan 's "" Wind of Change "" pronouncement left the British faction feeling that Britain had abandoned them. The more conservative English-speakers gave support to Verwoerd; others were troubled by the severing of ties with Britain and remained loyal to the Crown. They were acutely displeased at the choice between British and South African nationality. Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs, the subsequent ballot illustrated only a minor swell of support, proving that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population.     [ edit ]   Apartheid system   The apartheid system is often classified into ""grand apartheid"" and ""petty apartheid"". Grand apartheid involved an attempt to partition South Africa into separate states, while petty apartheid referred to the segregationist dimension. The National Party clung to grand apartheid until the 1990s, while they abandoned petty apartheid during the 1980s.

(February 2009)              Map showing the location of bantustans in South Africa              A rural area in  Ciskei , one of the apartheid era "" homelands ""       Main article:  Bantustan   South African blacks were stripped of their  citizenship , legally becoming citizens of one of ten tribally based and nominally  self-governing   bantustans  (tribal homelands), four of which became nominally independent states. The homelands occupied relatively small and economically unproductive areas of the country. Many black South Africans, however, never resided in their identified ""homelands"". The homeland system  disenfranchised  black people residing in ""white South Africa"" [ 10 ]  by restricting their voting rights to their own identified black homeland. The government segregated  education , medical care, and other public services, and provided black people with services greatly inferior to those of whites, and, to a lesser extent, to those of Indians and coloureds. The education system practised in 'black schools' was designed to prepare blacks for lives as a labouring class.   When the NP came into power in 1948, its primary endeavour was to attain a white supremacist Christian National State and implement racial segregation. The key building blocks to enforcement of racial segregation were     the arrangement of the population into African, coloured, Indian and white racial groups;   strict racial segregation in the urban areas;   restricted African urbanisation;   a tightly-controlled and more restricted system of migrant labour;   a stronger accent on tribalism and orthodoxy in African administration than in the past; and   a drastic strengthening of security legislation and control.     The ""Homelands"" system was developed on the basis of these tenets. Territorial separation was not a new institution. There were, for example, the ""reserves"" created under the British government in the Nineteenth Century. Under HF Verwoerd's jurisdiction, however, this land was seen as a way to control the increasing movement of black people into the city. Black people would work in the cities but live in their own areas, where they would be housed, educated, and vote for their own internal governments. The ultimate plan was to create ten independent national states out of these homelands.   The state passed two laws which paved the way for ""grand apartheid"", which was centred on separating races on a large scale, through spatial divisions; that is, compelling people to live in separate places defined by race. The first grand apartheid law was the Population Registration Act 30 of 1950, which necessitated all citizens' being categorised according to race and this being recorded in their identity passes. Official team or Boards were established to come to an ultimate conclusion on those people whose race was unclear. This caused much difficulty, especially for coloured people, separating their families as members were allocated different races. [ citation needed ]   The second pillar of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act 21 of 1950. Until then, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which was used in later years as a basis of forced removal [ citation needed ] .   The racial groups or national units that were intended to become ""homelands"" were North-Sotho, South-Sotho,  Tswana ,  Zulu ,  Swazi ,  Xhosa ,  Tsonga  and  Venda . In later years, the Xhosa national unit was broken further down into the  Transkei  and  Ciskei . The  Ndebele  national unit was also added later after its ""discovery"" by the apartheid government. The government justified its plans on the basis that South Africa was made up of different ""nations"", asserting that ""(the) government's policy is, therefore, not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood, of different nations, granting to each self-determination within the borders of their homelands - hence this policy of separate development"". The policy of separate development came into being with the accession to power of Dr HF Verwoerd in 1958. He began implementing the homeland structure as a cornerstone of separate development. Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of ""independence"" to these homelands. Border industries and the Bantu Investment Corporation, were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in the homelands (to draw black people away from ""white"" South Africa) [ citation needed ] .   The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 decided that apartheid was justifiable, but stated additional land ought to be given to the homelands, favouring the development of border industries. In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act was passed, and proponents of apartheid began to argue that, once apartheid had been implemented, blacks would no longer be citizens of South Africa; they would instead become citizens of the independent ""homelands"". In terms of this model, blacks became (foreign) ""guest labourers"" who merely worked in South Africa as the holders of temporary work permits.   The South African government attempted to divide South Africa into a number of separate states. Some thirteen per cent of the land was reserved for black homelands - representing fifty per cent of South Africa's arable land [ 11 ] . That thirteen per cent was divided into ten black ""homelands"" amongst eight ethnic units. Four of these were given independence, although this was never recognised by any other country. Each homeland was supposed to develop into a separate-nation state within which the eight black ethnic groups were to find and grow their separate national identity, culture and language;  Transkei  - Xhosa (given ""independence""),  Ciskei  - Xhosa (given ""independence"" in 1981),  Bophuthatswana  - Tswana (given ""independence""),  Venda  - Venda (given ""independence"");  KwaZulu  - Zulu,  Lebowa  - Pedi,  Kangwane  - Swazi,  QwaQwa  - Sotho,  Gazankulu  - Tsonga, and  KwaNdebele  - Ndebele. Each homeland controlled its own education and health system.   Not all the homelands chose to become self-governing. Those who did choose autonomy were the  Transkei  (1976),  Bophuthatswana  (1977),  Venda  (1979) and the  Ciskei  (1981). Once a homeland was granted its ""independence,"" its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked, replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the supposedly ""autonomous"" homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African. [ 12 ]  The South African government attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black ""citizens"" of the ""homelands"" and the problems which other countries faced through entry of  illegal immigrants .   While other countries were dismantling their discriminatory legislation and becoming more liberal on racial issues, South Africa continued to construct a structure of legislation promoting racial and ethnic separation.   Many white South Africans supported apartheid because of  demographics ; that is, separation and partition were seen as a means of avoiding a one-person-one-vote democracy within a single unified South African state, which would render whites a politically-powerless minority. In addition, leaders of the above homelands became important defenders of apartheid, such as  Kaiser Matanzima ,  Bantu Holomisa ,  Oupa Gqozo ,  Lucas Mangope  and  Mangosuthu Buthelezi .   Apartheid placed great emphasis on ""self-determination"" and ""cultural autonomy"" for different ethnic groups. For this reason, ""mother-tongue"" education was strongly emphasized. Thus, in addition to pouring resources into developing Afrikaans educational material, resources were also poured into developing school textbooks in black languages like Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and Pedi. As a result, one of the consequences of apartheid was a South African population literate in black-African languages (a rare thing in Africa where schooling is normally carried out in colonial languages like English and French).     [ edit ]   Forced removals              This article  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (May 2007)       During the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of 'resettlement', to force people to move to their designated ""group areas"". Some argue that over three and a half million people were forced to resettle during this period. These removals included people re-located due to slum clearance programmes, labour tenants on white-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called 'black spots', areas of black-owned land surrounded by white farms, the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and 'surplus people' from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a 'Coloured Labour Preference Area' [ 13 ] ) who were moved to the  Transkei  and  Ciskei  homelands. The best-publicised forced removals of the 1950s occurred in  Johannesburg , when 60,000 people were moved to the new township of  Soweto , an acronym for South Western Townships. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]   Until 1955  Sophiatown  had been one of the few urban areas where blacks were allowed to own land, and was slowly developing into a multiracial slum. As industry in Johannesburg grew, Sophiatown became the home of a rapidly expanding black workforce, as it was convenient and close to town. It could also boast the only swimming pool for black children in Johannesburg. [ 16 ]  As one of the oldest black settlements in Johannesburg,  Sophiatown  held an almost symbolic importance for the 50,000 blacks it contained, both in terms of its sheer vibrancy and its unique culture. Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police entered Sophiatown to force residents out of their homes and load their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land, thirteen miles (19 km) from the city centre, known as  Meadowlands  (that the government had purchased in 1953). Meadowlands became part of a new planned black city called Soweto. The Sophiatown slum was destroyed by bulldozers, and a new white suburb named Triomf (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to people of African descent. Forced removals from areas like Cato Manor (Mkhumbane) in  Durban , and  District Six  in  Cape Town , where 55,000 coloured and Indian people were forced to move to new townships on the Cape Flats, were carried out under the  Group Areas Act  of 1950. Ultimately, nearly 600,000 coloured, Indian and Chinese people were moved in terms of the Group Areas Act. Some 40,000 white people were also forced to move when land was transferred from ""white South Africa"" into the black homelands.     [ edit ]   Petty apartheid          Racial-demographic map of South Africa published by  CIA  in 1979 with data from the 1970 South African census       The National Party passed a string of legislation which became known as petty apartheid. The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act 55 of 1949, prohibiting marriage between white people and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act 21 of 1950 (as amended in 1957 by Act 23) forbade ""unlawful racial intercourse"" and ""any immoral or indecent act"" between a white person and an African, Indian or coloured person.   Blacks were not allowed to run businesses or professional practices in those areas designated as ""white South Africa"" without a permit. They were supposed to move to the black ""homelands"" and set up businesses and practices there. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Black buses stopped at black bus stops and white buses at white ones. Trains, hospitals and ambulances were segregated. Because of the smaller numbers of white patients and the fact that white doctors preferred to work in ""white"" hospitals, conditions in white hospitals were much better than those in often overcrowded black hospitals. [ 17 ]  Blacks were excluded from living or working in white areas, unless they had a pass  nicknamed the  dompas  (""dumb pass"" in Afrikaans). Only blacks with ""Section 10"" rights (those who had migrated to the cities before World War II) were excluded from this provision. A pass was issued only to a black person with approved work. Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands. A pass was issued for one magisterial district (usually one town) confining the holder to that area only. Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant. This was often followed by deportation to the person's  homeland  and prosecution of the employer (for employing an illegal migrant). Police vans patrolled the ""white"" areas to round up ""illegal"" blacks found there without passes. Black people were not allowed to employ white people in ""white South Africa"".   Although  trade unions  for black and "" coloured "" (mixed race) workers had existed since the early 20th century, it was not until the 1980s reforms that a mass black trade union movement developed.   In the 1970s each black child's education within the Bantu Education system (the education system practiced in 'black schools' within ""white South Africa"") cost the state only a tenth of each white child's.  Higher education  was provided in separate universities and colleges after 1959. Eight black universities were created in the homelands.  Fort Hare University  in the  Ciskei  (now Eastern Cape) was to register only  Xhosa -speaking students.  Sotho ,  Tswana ,  Pedi  and  Venda  speakers were placed at the newly-founded  University College of the North  at Turfloop, while the  University College of Zululand  was launched to serve Zulu scholars. Coloureds and Indians were to have their own establishments in the  Cape  and  Natal  respectively.   In addition, each black homeland controlled its own separate education, health and police system. Blacks were not allowed to buy hard liquor. They were able only to buy state-produced poor quality beer (although this was relaxed later). Public beaches were racially segregated. Public swimming pools, some pedestrian bridges, drive-in cinema parking spaces, graveyards, parks, and public toilets were segregated. Cinemas and theatres in ""white areas"" were not allowed to admit blacks. There were practically no cinemas in black areas. Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff. Black Africans were prohibited from attending ""white"" churches under the  Churches Native Laws Amendment Act  of 1957. This was, however, never rigidly enforced, and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law. Blacks earning 360  rand  a year, 30 rand a month, or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high, at 750 rand a year, 62.5 rand per month. On the other hand, the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks.   Blacks could never acquire land in white areas. In the homelands, much of the land belonged to a 'tribe', where the local chieftain would decide how the land had to be utilized. This resulted in white people owning almost all the industrial and agricultural lands and much of the prized residential land. Most blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship when the ""homelands"" became ""independent"". Thus, they were no longer able to apply for South African passports. Eligibility requirements for a passport had been difficult for blacks to meet, the government contending that a passport was a privilege, not a right. As such, the government did not grant many passports to blacks. Apartheid pervaded South African culture, as well as the law. This was reinforced by much of the media, and the lack of opportunities for the races to mix in a social setting entrenched social distance between people.

(These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law). The Coloured group included people of mixed  Bantu ,  Khoisan , and  European  descent (with some  Malay  ancestry, especially in the  Western Cape ). The Apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria at the time that the Population Registration Act was implemented to determine who was Coloured. Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or Black, or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or White. Different members of the same family found themselves in different race groups. Further tests determined membership of the various sub-racial groups of the Coloureds. Many of those who formerly belonged to this racial group are opposed to the continuing use of the term ""coloured"" in the post-apartheid era, though the term no longer signifies any legal meaning. The expressions 'so-called Coloured' ( Afrikaans   sogenaamde Kleurlinge ) and 'brown people' ( bruin mense ) acquired a wide usage in the 1980s.   Discriminated against by apartheid, Coloureds were as a matter of state policy forced to live in separate  townships   in some cases leaving homes their families had occupied for generations  and received an inferior education, though better than that provided to Black South Africans. They played an important role in the struggle against apartheid: for example the  African Political Organization  established in 1902 had an exclusively coloured membership.   Voting rights were denied to  Coloureds  in the same way that they were denied to blacks from 1950 to 1983. However, in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring coloured and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among white voters, and the  Tricameral Parliament  was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The theory was that the Coloured minority could be granted voting rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) UDF as a vehicle to try and prevent the co-option of coloureds and Indians into an alliance with white South Africans. The subsequent battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans.     [ edit ]   Women under apartheid   Colonialism  and  apartheid  had a major impact on women since they suffered both racial and gender discrimination. Oppression against African women was different from discrimination against men. Indeed, they had very few or no legal rights, no access to education and no right to own property. [ 18 ]  Jobs were often hard to find but many African women worked as agricultural or domestic workers though wages were extremely low [ 19 ]  if not non-existent. Children suffered from diseases caused by malnutrition and sanitary problems, and mortality rates were therefore high. The controlled movement of African workers within the country through the  Natives Urban Areas Act of 1923  and the pass-laws, separated family members from one another as men usually worked in urban centers, while women were forced to stay in rural areas. Marriage law and births [ 20 ]  were also controlled by the government and the pro-apartheid  Dutch Reformed Church , who tried to restrict African birth rates.     [ edit ]   Other minorities   Defining its East Asian population, which is a minority in  South Africa  but who do not physically appear to belong any of the four designated groups, was a constant dilemma for the apartheid government. Chinese South Africans who were descendants of migrant workers who came to work in the gold mines around Johannesburg in the late 19th century, were classified as ""Other Asian"" and hence ""non-white"", whereas immigrants from  Republic of China (Taiwan) ,  South Korea  and  Japan , with which  South Africa  maintained diplomatic relations, were considered ""honorary whites"", thus granted the same privileges as normal whites.     [ edit ]   Conservatism   The National Party government implemented, alongside apartheid, a programme of social  conservatism . Pornography, gambling and other such vices were banned. Cinemas, shops selling alcohol and most other businesses were forbidden from operating on Sundays.  Abortion  and  sex education  were also restricted; abortion was legal only in cases of rape or if the mother's life was threatened.   Television  was not introduced  until 1975 because the government viewed it as dangerous. [ 21 ]  Television was also run on apartheid lines - TV1 broadcast in Afrikaans and English (geared to a white audience), TV2 in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 in Sotho, Tswana and Pedi (both geared to a black audience), and TV4 mostly showed programmes for an urban-black audience.     [ edit ]   Internal resistance   Main article:  Internal resistance to South African apartheid   The system of apartheid sparked significant  internal resistance . [ 22 ]  The government responded to a series of popular uprisings and protests with police brutality, which in turn increased local support for the armed resistance struggle. [ 23 ]  Internal resistance to the apartheid system in South Africa came from several sectors of society and saw the creation of organizations dedicated variously to peaceful protests, passive resistance and armed insurrection.   In 1949 the  youth wing  of the  African National Congress  (ANC) took control of the organization and started advocating a radical black nationalist programme. The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action, a series of strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience actions that led to occasionally violent clashes with the authorities.   In 1959 a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the  Pan Africanist Congress  (PAC), which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of those protests was held in the township of Sharpeville, where 69 people were killed by police in the  Sharpeville massacre .   In the wake of the Sharpeville incident the government declared a state of emergency, More than 18 000 people were arrested, including leaders of the ANC and PAC, and both organisations were banned. The resistance went underground, with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of domestic sabotage and terrorism.   In May 1961, prior to the declaration of South Africa as a Republic, an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings, threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored.   When the government overlooked them, the strikers (among the main organizers was a 42-year old,  Thembu -origin man called  Nelson Mandela ) carried out their threats. The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality. [ 24 ]  Defeated, the protesters called off their strike. The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing,  Umkhonto we Sizwe  (MK), which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures. Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961, the anniversary of the  Battle of Blood River .   In the 1970s the Black Consciousness Movement was created by tertiary students influenced by the American Black Power movement. BC endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system. The leader of the movement,  Steve Biko , was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was murdered in detention.   In 1976 secondary students in  Soweto  took to the streets in the  Soweto uprising  to protest against forced tuition in Afrikaans. On 16 June, in what was meant to be a peaceful protest, 23 people were killed. In the following years several student organisations were formed with the goal of protesting against apartheid, and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 as well as rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986.   In parallel to student protests, labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974. After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, filling the gap left by the banning of political parties. In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining, although strikes were still illegal.   At roughly the same time churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance. Church leaders were not immune to prosecution, and certain faith-based organisations were banned, but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did.   Although the majority of whites supported apartheid, some 20 percent did not support apartheid. Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by  Helen Suzman ,  Colin Eglin  and  Harry Schwarz . Extra-parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the  South African Communist Party  and women's organisation the  Black Sash . Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties.

Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the  Sharpeville Massacre , resulting in more international condemnation. Soon thereafter, Verwoerd announced a  referendum  on whether the country should sever links with the  British monarchy  and become a  republic  instead. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for whites to eighteen and included whites in  South West Africa  on the voter's roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked whites, ""Do you support a republic for the Union?"", and 52 per cent voted ""Yes"". As a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the  Commonwealth , with which it had privileged trade links. Even though  India  became a  republic within the Commonwealth  in 1947 it became clear that  African  and  Asian  member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence.     [ edit ]   United Nations       ""We speak out to put the world on guard against what is happening in South Africa. The brutal policy of apartheid is applied before the eyes of the nations of the world. The peoples of Africa are compelled to endure the fact that on the African continent the superiority of one race over another remains official policy, and that in the name of this racial superiority murder is committed with impunity. Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?""       Che Guevara , speech to the United Nations as  Cuba's  representative, December 11 1964  [ 25 ]     At the first UN gathering in 1946, South Africa was placed on the agenda. The primary subject in question was the handling of South African Indians, a great cause of divergence between South Africa and India. In 1952, apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although South Africa's racial policies were a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction.   In April 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed following the Sharpeville massacre, and the Security Council for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime, demanding an end to racial separation and discrimination. From 1960 the ANC began a campaign of armed struggle of which there would later be a charge of 193 acts of terrorism from 1961-1963, mainly bombings and murders of civilians.   Instead, the South African government then began further suppression, banning the ANC and PAC. In 1961, UN Secretary-General  Dag Hammarskjld  stopped over in South Africa and subsequently stated that he had been unable to reach agreement with Prime Minister Verwoerd.   On 6 November 1962, the  United Nations General Assembly  passed  Resolution 1761 , condemning South African apartheid policies. In 1966, the UN held the first [ which? ]  of many colloquiums on apartheid. The General Assembly announced 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in memory of the Sharpeville massacre. [ citation needed ]  In 1971, the General Assembly formally denounced the institution of homelands, and a motion [ which? ]  was passed in 1974 to expel South Africa from the UN, but this was vetoed by France, Britain and the United States of America, all key trade associates of South Africa. [ citation needed ]   On 7 August 1963 the  United Nations Security Council  passed  Resolution 181  calling for a voluntary  arms embargo  against South Africa, and in the same year, a Special Committee Against Apartheid was established to encourage and oversee plans of action against the regime. From 1964, the US and Britain discontinued their arms trade with South Africa. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 .   Economic sanctions against South Africa were also frequently debated as an effective way of putting pressure on the apartheid government. In 1962, the UN General Assembly requested that its members sever political, fiscal and transportation ties with South Africa. In 1968, it proposed ending all cultural, educational and sporting connections as well. Economic sanctions, however, were not made mandatory, because of opposition from South Africa's main trading partners.   In 1978 and 1983 the  United Nations  condemned South Africa at the  World Conference Against Racism , and a significant  divestment movement  started, pressuring investors to disinvest from South African companies or companies that did business with South Africa.   After much debate, by the late 1980s the  United States , the  United Kingdom , and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. [ 26 ]  A  divestment  movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks.

(January 2008)       The  Organisation for African Unity  (OAU) was created in 1963. Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa. It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa. African states agreed to aid the liberation movements in their fight against apartheid. In 1969, fourteen nations from Central and East Africa gathered in  Lusaka ,  Zambia , and formulated the 'Lusaka Manifesto', which was signed on 13 April by all of the countries in attendance except  Malawi . This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations.   The Lusaka Manifesto summarised the political situations of self-governing African countries, condemning racism and inequity, and calling for black majority rule in all African nations. It did not rebuff South Africa entirely, though, adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government, and even recognising its autonomy. Although African leaders supported the emancipation of black South Africans, they preferred this to be attained through peaceful means. The manifesto's signatories did not support violent opposition to apartheid, because, for one thing, they could ill afford it and, for another, they dreaded retaliation. [ citation needed ]   South Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to her policies brought about another OAU announcement in 1971. The Mogadishu Declaration declared that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that her black people could only be freed through military means, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government. Henceforth, it would be up to South Africa to keep contact with other African states.     [ edit ]   Outward-Looking Policy             This section  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (July 2008)       In 1966, BJ Vorster was made South African Prime Minister. He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's isolation and to revitalise the country's global reputation, even those with black-ruled nations in Africa. This he called his ""Outward-Looking"" policy; the buzzwords for his strategy were ""dialogue"" and ""dtente"", signifying a reduction of tension.   Vorster's willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd's refusal to engage with leaders such as  Abubakar Tafawa Balewa  of  Nigeria  in 1962 and  Kenneth Kaunda  of  Zambia  in 1964. In 1966, Vorster met with the heads of the neighbouring states of  Lesotho ,  Swaziland  and  Botswana . In 1967, Vorster offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that no political strings were attached, aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa's racial policies. Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working on the South African mines. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid, but depended on South Africa's economic aid.   Malawi was the first country not on South African borders to accept South African aid. In 1967, the two states set out their political and economic relations, and, in 1969, Malawi became the only country at the assembly which did not sign the  Lusaka Manifesto  condemning South Africa' apartheid policy. In 1970, Malawian president  Hastings Banda  made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa.   Associations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were  Liberia ,  Ivory Coast ,  Madagascar ,  Mauritius ,  Gabon ,  Zaire  (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo),  Ghana  and the  Central African Republic . Although these states condemned apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), South Africa's economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees.     [ edit ]   Cultural and sporting isolation   Main article:  Sporting boycott of South Africa   South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid 1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the  International Table Tennis Federation  severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.   In 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with white establishments, SASA approached the  International Olympic Committee  (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's expulsion from the  Olympic Games . The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, they would be barred from the  1964 Olympic Games . The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the  1964 Games in Tokyo . South Africa selected a multi-racial side for the next Games, and the IOC opted for incorporation in the  1968 Games in Mexico . Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation.   Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa, until the 1970 New Zealand  All Blacks  rugby tour allowed  Maori  to go under the status of 'honorary whites'. Huge and widespread protest occurred in New Zealand in 1981 against the Springbok tour, the government spent eight million dollars protecting games using the army and police force. A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protestors and it was cancelled. A 'rebel tour' not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and  New Zealand  made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid. [ 28 ] [ citation needed ]   B. J. Vorster  took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit  Basil D'Oliveira , a  Coloured  South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, ""Dolly"" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.   In 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations.   In  1978 ,  Nigeria   boycotted  the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977  Gleneagles Agreement . Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the  1986 Commonwealth Games  because of British prime minister  Margaret Thatcher 's ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight. [ 29 ]   Sporting bans were revoked in 1993, when conciliations for a democratic South Africa were well under way.   In the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for  cultural  boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor  Marlon Brando  called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the  Writers' Guild of Great Britain  called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in Britain and America was also vetoed. After the arrival of  television  in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union,  Equity , boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions, but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid.     [ edit ]   Western influence   While international opposition to apartheid grew, the  Nordic countries  in particular provided both moral and financial support for the ANC. On 21 February 1986  a week before he was murdered   Sweden 's prime minister  Olof Palme  made the  keynote  address to the  Swedish People's Parliament Against Apartheid  held in  Stockholm . In addressing the hundreds of anti-apartheid sympathizers as well as leaders and officials from the ANC and the  Anti-Apartheid Movement  such as  Oliver Tambo , Palme declared:     ""Apartheid cannot be reformed; it has to be eliminated.""     Other Western countries adopted a more ambivalent position. In the 1980s, both the  Reagan  and  Thatcher  administrations in the USA and UK followed a ' constructive engagement ' policy with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions on South Africa, justified by a belief in free trade and a vision of South Africa as a bastion against  Marxist  forces in Southern Africa. Thatcher declared the ANC a terrorist organisation, [ 30 ] , and in 1987 her spokesman,  Bernard Ingham , famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was ""living in  cloud cuckoo land "". [ 31 ]   By the late 1980s, however, with the tide of the  Cold War  turning and no sign of a political resolution in South Africa, Western patience with the apartheid government began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan  Republican / Democratic  initiative in the US favoured  economic sanctions  (realized as the  Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act ), the release of  Nelson Mandela  and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC. Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle. [ 32 ]   Britain's significant economic involvement in South Africa may have provided some  leverage  with the South African government, with both the UK and the US applying pressure on the government, and pushing for negotiations. However, neither Britain nor the US were willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa, such as the mining company  Anglo American . Although a high-profile compensation claim against these companies was thrown out of court in 2004, [ 33 ]  the  US Supreme Court  in May 2008 upheld an appeal court ruling allowing another lawsuit that seeks damages of more than  $400 billion  from major international companies which are accused of aiding South Africa's apartheid system. [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   South African Border War   Main articles:  South African Border War  and  Angolan civil war   By 1966,  SWAPO  launched guerilla raids from neighbouring countries against South Africa's occupation of  South-West Africa / Namibia . Initially South Africa fought a  counter-insurgency  war against SWAPO. This conflict deepened after  Angola  gained its independence in 1975 under the  communist  leadership of the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  (MPLA) when South Africa and the United States sided with the Angolan rival  UNITA  party against the MPLA's armed force, FAPLA (People's  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola ). By the end of the 1970s,  Cuba  had joined the fray, in one of several late  Cold War  flashpoints throughout  Southern Africa . [ 35 ]  The  Angolan civil war  developed into a conventional war with South Africa and UNITA on one side against the Angolan MPLA government, the Cubans, the Soviets and SWAPO on the other. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Total onslaught   By 1980, as international opinion turned decisively against the apartheid regime, the government and much of the white population increasingly looked upon the country as a  bastion  besieged by communism and radical black nationalists. Considerable effort was put into circumventing  sanctions , and the government even went so far as to develop  nuclear weapons , allegedly with the help of  Israel . [ 37 ]   The term "" front-line states "" referred to countries in  Southern Africa  geographically near South Africa. Although these front-line states were all opposed to apartheid, many were economically dependent on South Africa. In 1980, they formed the  Southern African Development Coordination Conference  (SADCC), the aim of which was to promote economic development in the region and hence reduce dependence on South Africa. Furthermore, many SADCC members also allowed the exiled ANC and  Pan Africanist Congress  (PAC) to establish bases in their countries.     [ edit ]   Cross-border raids   South Africa had a policy of attacking terrorist bases in neighboring countries. These attacks were mainly aimed at ANC, PAC and SWAPO guerrilla-bases and safe houses in retaliation for acts of terror - like bomb explosions, massacres and guerrilla actions (like sabotage) by ANC, PAC and Swapo guerrillas in South Africa and Namibia. The country also aided organisations in surrounding countries who were actively combating the spread of communism in Southern Africa. The results of these policies included:     Support for anti-government guerrilla groups such as  UNITA  in  Angola  and  RENAMO  in  Mozambique   South African Defence Force  (SADF; now the  South African National Defence Force ; SANDF) hit-squad raids into front-line states. Bombing raids were also conducted into neighbouring states.   A full-scale invasion of Angola: this was partly in support of UNITA, but was also an attempt to strike at  SWAPO  bases.   Targeting of exiled ANC leaders abroad: Joe Slovo's wife  Ruth First  was killed by a parcel bomb in Maputo, and 'death squads' of the  Civil Co-operation Bureau  and the Directorate of Military Intelligence attempted to carry out assassinations on ANC targets in  Brussels ,  Paris  and  Stockholm , as well as burglaries and bombings in  London . [ citation needed ]     In 1984, Mozambican president  Samora Machel  signed the  Nkomati Accord  with South Africa's president  P.W. Botha , in an attempt to rebuild Mozambique's economy. South Africa agreed to cease supporting anti-government forces, while the MK was prohibited from operating in Mozambique. This was a setback for the ANC.   In 1986 President Machel was killed in  an air crash  in mountainous terrain in South Africa near the Mozambican border after returning from a meeting in  Zambia . South Africa was accused [ who? ]  of continuing its aid to RENAMO and having caused the accident by using a false  radio navigation  beacon to lure the aircraft into crashing. This  conspiracy theory  was never proven and is still a subject of some controversy, despite the  South African Margo Commission  finding that the crash was an accident. A Soviet delegation that did not participate in the investigation issued a minority report implicating South Africa.     [ edit ]   State security   During the 1980s the government, led by P.W. Botha, became increasingly preoccupied with security. On the advice of American political scientist  Samuel P. Huntington , Botha's government set up a powerful  state security apparatus  to ""protect"" the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to trigger. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as securocrats), who managed the various States of Emergencies.   Botha's years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa, as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate SWAPO in  Namibia . Within South Africa, meanwhile, vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans, and an effective end to the ANC's sabotage campaign.   The government punished political offenders brutally. Between 1982 and 1983, 40,000 people were subjected to whipping as a form of punishment. The vast majority had committed political offences and were lashed ten times for their trouble. If convicted of treason, a person could be hanged, and the government executed numerous political offenders in this way.   As the 1980s progressed, more and more anti-apartheid organizations were formed and affiliated with the UDF. Led by the  Reverend   Allan Boesak  and Albertina Sisulu, the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish apartheid and eliminate the homelands completely.     [ edit ]   State of Emergency   Serious political violence was a prominent feature of South Africa from 1985 to 1989, as black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti-apartheid organisations and the Botha government. Throughout the 1980s, township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities. The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders, who were seen to be supporting the government. By 1985, it had become the ANC's aim to make black townships ""ungovernable"" (a term later replaced by ""people's power"") by means of rent boycotts and other militant action. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. People's courts were set up, and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishment. Black town councillors and policemen, and sometimes their families, attacked with petrol bombs, beatan, and murdered by  necklacing , where a burning tyre was placed around the victim's neck.   On 20 July 1985, State President  P.W. Botha  declared a State of Emergency in 36 magisterial districts. Areas affected were the  Eastern Cape , and the  PWV  region ("" Pretoria ,  Witwatersrand ,  Vereeniging ""). Three months later the  Western Cape  was included as well. An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed (restricted in some way); many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them. During this state of emergency about 2,436 people were detained under the  Internal Security Act . This act gave police and the military sweeping powers. The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people. The president could rule by decree without referring to the constitution or to parliament. It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening. It was illegal to advise anyone to stay away from work or oppose the government. It was illegal, too, to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government saw fit to release that name. People could face up to ten years' imprisonment for these offences. Detention without trial became a common feature of the government's reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988, 30,000 people had been detained. Thousands were arrested and many were interrogated and  tortured .   On 12 June 1986, four days before the ten-year anniversary of the  Soweto uprising , the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country. The government amended the  Public Security Act , expanding its powers to include the right to declare ""unrest"" areas, allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas. Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government's strategy and television cameras were banned from entering such areas. The state broadcaster, the  South African Broadcasting Corporation  (SABC) provided propaganda in support of the government. Media opposition to the system increased, supported by the growth of a pro-ANC underground press within South Africa.   In 1987, the State of Emergency was extended for another two years. Meanwhile, about 200,000 members of the National Union of Mineworkers commenced the longest strike (three weeks) in South African history. 1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti-apartheid organisations.   Much of the violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s was directed at the government, but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves. Many died in violence between members of  Inkatha  and the UDF-ANC faction. It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other when it suited it. Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad; they undertook cross-border army and air-force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases, killing and maiming innocent civilians. The ANC and the PAC in return exploded bombs at restaurants, shopping centres and government buildings such as magistrates courts, killing and maiming civilians and government officials.   The state of emergency continued until 1990, when it was lifted by State President  F.W. de Klerk     [ edit ]   Final years of apartheid             This article is  written like  a personal reflection or essay  and may require  cleanup .  Please  help improve it  by rewriting it in an  encyclopedic style .  (September 2008)       In the 1960s South Africa had economic growth second only to that of Japan. Trade with Western countries grew, and investors from the United States, France and Britain rushed in to get a piece of the action. Resistance among blacks had been crushed. Since 1964 Mandela, leader of the African Nation Congress, had been in prison on Robben Island just off the coast from Cape Town, and it appeared that South Africa's security forces could handle any resistance to apartheid. But in the seventies this rosy picture for South Africa's whites began to fade.   In 1974, resistance to apartheid was encouraged by Portugal's withdrawal from Mozambique and Angola. Portugal could not afford to continue combating liberation movements in its colonies, which were being aided by the Soviet Union and China. South African troops withdrew from Angola in early 1976, failing to prevent the liberation forces from gaining power there, and black students in South Africa celebrated a victory of black liberation over white resistance.   In 1978 the defense minister of the Nationalist Party, P.W. Botha, became Prime Minister. Botha's all white regime was worried about the Soviet Union helping revolutionaries in South Africa, and the economy had turned sluggish. The new government noted that it was spending too much money trying to maintain the segregated homelands that had been created for blacks and the homelands were proving to be uneconomic.   Nor was maintaining blacks as a third class working well. The labor of blacks remained vital to the economy, and illegal black labor unions were flourishing. Many blacks remained too poor to make much of a contribution to the economy through their purchasing power - although they were more than 70 percent of the population. Capitalism functioned on goodwill, and it was goodwill that Botha's regime was most concerned - not for the sake of capitalism so much as it was afraid that an antidote was needed to prevent the blacks from being attracted to Communism.   The anti-apartheid movements in the United States and Europe were gaining support for boycotts against South Africa, for the withdrawal of U.S. firms from South Africa and for the release of Mandela. South Africa was becoming an outlaw in the world community of nations. Investing in South Africa by Americans and others was coming to an end.     [ edit ]   Tricameral Parliament   In the early 1980s, Botha's National Party government started to recognise the inevitability of the need to reform apartheid. Early reforms were driven by a combination of internal violence, international condemnation, changes within the National Party's constituency, and changing demographics  whites constituted only 16% of the total population, in comparison to 20% fifty years earlier.   In 1983, a new constitution was passed implementing a so-called Tricameral Parliament, giving coloureds and Indians voting rights and parliamentary representation in separate houses - the House of Assembly (178 members) for whites, the House of Representatives (85 members) for coloureds and the House of Delegates (45 members) for Indians. Each House handled laws pertaining to its racial group's ""own affairs"", including health, education and other community issues. All laws relating to ""general affairs"" (matters such as defence, industry and taxation) were handled by a cabinet made up of representatives from all three houses, where the ruling party in the white House of Assembly had an unassailable numerical advantage. Blacks, although making up the majority of the population, were excluded from representation; they remained nominal citizens of their homelands. The first Tricameral elections were largely boycotted by Coloured and Indian voters, amid widespread rioting.     [ edit ]   Reforms and contact with the ANC under Botha   Concerned over the popularity of Mandela, Botha denounced him as an arch-Marxist committed to violent revolution, but to appease black opinion and nurture Mandela as a benevolent leader of blacks the government moved Mandela from Robben Island to a more pleasant prison in a rural area just outside Cape Town, Pollsmoor prison, where prison life was easier and more pleasant. And the government allowed Mandela more visitors, including visits and interviews by foreigners - to let the world know that Mandela was being treated well.   Black homelands were declared nation-states and pass laws were abolished. Also, black labor unions were legitimized, the government recognized the right of blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave blacks property rights there. Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sex between the races, which was under ridicule abroad. The spending for black schools increased, to one-seventh of white children per child - up from on one-sixteenth in 1968. At the same time, attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus.   In January 1985, Botha addressed the government's House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives. Mandela's reply was read in public by one of his allies - his first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty-one years before. Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence. The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants. This response helped to further elevate Mandela's status in the eyes of those, both internationally and domestically, who opposed apartheid.   Between 1986 and 1988, some petty apartheid laws were repealed. Botha told white South Africans to ""adapt or die"" and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as ""rubicon"" announcements of substantial reforms, although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes. Ironically, these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the eighties as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement. Botha's government stopped short of substantial reforms, such as unbanning ANC, PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations, releasing political prisoners, or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid. The government's stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations ""renounced violence"".   By 1987 the growth of South Africa's economy had dropped to among the lowest rate in the world, and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many whites in South Africa. Examples of African states with black leaders and white minorities existed in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Whispers of South Africa one day having a black President sent more hardline whites into Rightist parties. Mandela was moved to a four-bedroom house of his own, with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees, on a prison farm just outside Cape Town. He had an unpublicized meeting with Botha, Botha impressing Mandela by walking forward, extending his hand and pouring Mandela's tea. And the two had a friendly discussion, Mandela comparing the African National Conference's rebellion with that of the Afrikaaner rebellion, and about everyone being brothers.   A number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC-in-exile and various sectors of the internal struggle, such as women and educationalists. More overtly, a group of white intellectuals met the ANC in  Senegal  for talks.     [ edit ]   Presidency of F.W. de Klerk   Early in 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; he was prevailed upon to resign on 13 February 1989. He was succeeded as president later that year by  F.W. de Klerk . Despite his initial reputation as a conservative, De Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country. In his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990, De Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the  African National Congress , the  Pan Africanist Congress , the  South African Communist Party  (SACP) and the UDF. The Land Act was brought to an end. De Klerk also made his first public commitment to release jailed ANC leader  Nelson Mandela , to return to  press freedom  and to suspend the  death penalty .Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of  common-law  crimes were released.   On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from  Victor Verster Prison  after more than 27 years in prison.   Having been instructed by the  UN Security Council  to end its long-standing military occupation in  South-West Africa  / Namibia , and in the face of military defeats and the growing cost of its war of occupation there, South Africa had had to relinquish control of this territory; Namibia officially became an independent state on 21 March 1990.     [ edit ]   Negotiations   Main article:  Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa   Apartheid was dismantled in a series of  negotiations  from 1990 to 1993, culminating in  elections in 1994 , the first in South Africa with  universal suffrage .   From 1990 to 1991, the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished. In 1990 negotiations were earnestly begun, with two meetings between the government and the ANC. The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition of power. These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations - despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country.   At the first meeting, the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin. The meeting was held at  Groote Schuur , the President's official residence. They released the Groote Schuur Minute which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return.   There were fears that the change of power in South Africa would be violent. To avoid this, it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached. In December 1991, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial transitional government and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups. CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an ""undivided South Africa"".   Reforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the right-wing white opposition, leading to the  Conservative Party  winning a number of by-elections against NP candidates. De Klerk responded by calling a whites-only  referendum  in March 1992 to decide whether or not negotiations should continue. A 68-percent majority of white voters gave its support, and the victory instilled in De Klerk and the government a lot more confidence, giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations.   Thus, when negotiations resumed in May 1992, under the tag of CODESA II, stronger demands were made. The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy. The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government, as well as the power to change decisions made by parliament.   Persistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations. Violence was due to impatience for change on the part of those still living under repression, and also the intense rivalry between the  Inkatha Freedom Party  (IFP) and the ANC. Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences, they could not stem the violence. One of the worst cases of ANC-IFP violence was the  Boipatong massacre  of 17 June 1992, when 200 IFP militants attacked the Gauteng township of Boipatong, killing 45. Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles, supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence. When De Klerk tried to visit the scene of the incident, he was driven away by angry crowds, on whom the police opened fire, killing three. [ 38 ]  Mandela argued that de Klerk, as head of state, was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed. He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC-IFP violence. This formed the basis for ANC's withdrawal from the negoatiations, and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage.   The  Bisho massacre  on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head. The Ciskei Defence Force killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the Ciskei homeland into South Africa. In the aftermath, Mandela and De Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence. This led to a resumption of negotiations.   Right-wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period. The assassination of  Chris Hani  on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos. Hani, the popular general secretary of the  South African Communist Party  (SACP), was assassinated in 1993 in Dawn Park in  Johannesburg  by  Janusz Walu , an anti-communist  Polish  refugee who had close links to the white nationalist  Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  (AWB). Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela; his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the international community, but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination. [ 39 ]  On 25 June 1993, the AWB used an armoured vehicle to  crash through the doors  of the World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council. Even this failed to derail the process.   In addition to the continuing ""black-on-black"" violence, there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC's military wing, the  Azanian People's Liberation Army  (APLA). The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry, impatient youth. In the  St James Church massacre  on 25 July 1993, members of the APLA opened fire in a church in  Cape Town , killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58.   In 1993,  de Klerk  and  Mandela  were jointly awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize  ""for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa"". [ 40 ]   Violence persisted right up to the 1994 elections.  Lucas Mangope , leader of the  Bophuthatswana  homeland, declared that it would not take part in the elections. It had been decided that, once the temporary constitution had come into effect, the homelands would be incorporated into South Africa, but Mangope did not want this to happen. There were strong protests against his decision, leading to a  coup d'tat in Bophuthatswana  on 10 March which deposed Mangope, despite the intervention of white right-wingers hoping to maintain him in power. Three AWB militants were killed during this intervention, and harrowing images were shown on national television and in newspapers across the world.   Two days before the elections, a  car bomb  exploded in Johannesburg, killing nine. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  The day before the elections, another one went off, injuring thirteen. Finally, though, at midnight on 2627 April 1994, the old flag was lowered, and the old (now co-official) national anthem  Die Stem  (""The Call"") was sung, followed by the raising of the new  rainbow flag  and singing of the other co-official anthem,  Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika  (""God Bless Africa"").     [ edit ]   1994 election   Main article:  South African general election, 1994   The election was held on 27 April 1994 and went off peacefully throughout the country as 20,000,000 South Africans cast their votes. There was some difficulty in organising the voting in rural areas, but, throughout the country, people waited patiently for many hours in order to vote amidst a palpable feeling of goodwill. An extra day was added to give everyone the chance. International observers agreed that the elections were free and fair.   The ANC won 62.65% of the vote, [ 43 ] [ 44 ]  less than the 66.7% that would have allowed it to rewrite the constitution. In the new parliament, 252 of its 400 seats went to members of the African National Congress. The NP captured most of the white and coloured votes and became the official opposition party. As well as deciding the national government, the election decided the provincial governments, and the ANC won in seven of the nine provinces, with the NP winning in the  Western Cape  and the IFP in  KwaZulu-Natal . On 10 May 1994, Mandela was sworn in as South Africa's president. The Government of National Unity was established, its cabinet made up of twelve ANC representatives, six from the NP, and three from the IFP.  Thabo Mbeki  and De Klerk were made deputy presidents.   The anniversary of the elections, 27 April, is celebrated as a  public holiday in South Africa  known as  Freedom Day .     [ edit ]   Contrition   The following individuals, who had previously supported apartheid, made public apologies:     FW de Klerk [ 45 ]  - ""I apologise in my capacity as leader of the NP to the millions who suffered wrenching disruption of forced removals; who suffered the shame of being arrested for pass law offences; who over the decades suffered the indignities and humiliation of racial discrimination.""   Marthinus van Schalkwyk [ 46 ]   Adriaan Vlok [ 47 ]  - who washed the feet of apartheid victim  Frank Chikane   Leon Wessels [ 48 ]  - who said ""I am now more convinced than ever that apartheid was a terrible mistake that blighted our land. South Africans did not listen to the laughing and the crying of each other. I am sorry that I had been so hard of hearing for so long"".

The  Republic of South Africa , most commonly referred to as  South Africa , occupies the southern tip of the  African  continent and borders the nations of  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique ,  Swaziland , and  Lesotho . Its long coastline stretches more than 2,500 km (over 1,550 miles) from the desert border with Namibia on the  Atlantic  coast southwards around the tip of Africa and then north to the border with subtropical Mozambique on the  Indian Ocean . It is the most modern nation on the continent, with its protected wildlife and ecosystem, balanced by its modern infrastructure, unmatched in Africa.   South Africa experienced a significantly different evolution from other nations on the continent as a result of two factors: higher European immigration rates and the strategic importance of the Cape sea route. Its mineral wealth made the country extremely important to Western interests, particularly during the  Cold War . As a result of immigration, South Africa is a racially diverse nation, with black South Africans accounting for slightly less than 80 percent of the population.   Racial strife between the white minority and the black majority has played a large part in the country's recent history and politics, culminating in  apartheid , which was instituted in 1948 by the National Party, though segregation existed prior to that date. The laws that defined apartheid began to be repealed or abolished by the National Party in 1990 after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the black majority as well as many white, coloured, and Indian South Africans. Its legacy of apartheid etched the country into the conscience of the world, especially in the 1980s, and resulted in economic sanctions from the international community.   The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'tat, and regular elections have been held for almost a century; however, the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994. The economy of South Africa is the largest and best developed on the continent, with modern infrastructure common throughout the country.   South Africa is often referred to as ""The Rainbow Nation,"" a term coined by Archbishop  Desmond Tutu  and later adopted by then-President  Nelson Mandela  as a metaphor to describe the country's newly developing multicultural diversity in the wake of segregationist apartheid ideology.

Extensive  fossil  remains in Makapans Cave and other locations suggest that various  australopithecines  existed in South Africa from about three million years ago. These were succeeded by various species of  Homo,  including  Homo habilis ,   Homo erectus  and modern man,  Homo sapiens,  at the Klasies River Caves. [1] Bantu-speaking peoples (here,  Bantu  is a linguistic term, not an ethnic one),  iron -using agriculturists and herdsmen had moved south of the Limpopo River into modern-day South Africa by the fourth or fifth century. They slowly moved south, displacing earlier  hunter-gatherer  peoples as they migrated.       Colonial period          Romanticized painting of an account of the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck.       The first circumnavigation of the Cape of Good Hope by Portuguese explorer  Bartolomeu Dias  occurred in 1488. Along with the accounts of early navigators, the accounts of shipwreck survivors provide the earliest written accounts of Southern Africa. In the two centuries following 1488, a number of small  fishing  settlements were made along the coast by Portuguese sailors. In 1652 a victualling station was established at the Cape of Good Hope by  Jan van Riebeeck  on behalf of the  Dutch East India Company . For most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a  Dutch  possession. The Dutch settlers eventually met the southwesterly expanding Xhosa people in the region of the Fish River. A series of wars ensued, mainly caused by conflicting land and livestock interests.   Great Britain  seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1797 seeking to use Cape Town in particular as a stop on the route to  Australia  and  India . The  Dutch East India Company  declared  bankruptcy , and the British annexed the Cape Colony in 1805. The British continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa, pushing the eastern frontier eastward through a line of forts established along the Fish River and consolidating it by encouraging British settlement. Due to pressure from abolitionist societies in Britain, the British Parliament first stopped its global  slave trade  in 1806, then abolished slavery in all its colonies in 1833.          Boer women and children in British concentration camps.       The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and  gold  in 1886 encouraged economic growth and immigration, intensifying the subjugation of the natives. The Boers successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (18801881) using  guerrilla warfare  tactics, much better suited to local conditions. However, the British returned in greater numbers in the  Second Boer War  (18991902). The Boers resisted fiercely, but the British eventually overwhelmed the Boer forces, using their superior numbers, improved tactics, and external supply chains. Also during this war, the British used controversial concentration camps and scorched earth tactics.     Union of South Africa   The Union of South Africa was created from the Cape and Natal colonies, as well as the republics of Orange Free State and Transvaal, on May 31, 1910. The newly created Union of South Africa was a dominion. In 1948, the right-wing National Party was elected to power and began implementing a series of harsh segregationist laws that would become known collectively as  apartheid . While the white minority enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, often comparable to Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. However, the average income and life expectancy of a black, Indian, or colored South African compared favorably to many other African states.          Prison buildings on Robben Island, the holding place of several anti-apartheid fighters including Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned there for 18 years. Robben Island is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.       Apartheid became increasingly controversial, leading to widespread sanctions and divestment abroad and growing unrest and oppression within South Africa. A long period of harsh suppression by the government, and resistance, strikes, marches, protests, and sabotage, by various anti-apartheid movements, most notably the African National Congress (ANC), followed. In 1990, the National Party government, under acting President F. W. de Klerk and Foreign Minister Roelof (""Pik"") Botha took the first steps, making a five-year plan, toward negotiating itself out of power. After consultation with  Kenneth Kaunda  of  Zambia , the National Party lifted the ban on the ANC and other left-wing political organizations and released  Nelson Mandela  from prison after 27 years of incarceration.     Post-apartheid   Apartheid  legislation was gradually removed from the statute books, and the first multi-racial elections were held in 1994. The ANC won by an overwhelming majority and has been in power ever since.   Despite the end of apartheid, millions of South Africans, mostly black, continue to live in poverty. This is attributed to the legacy of the apartheid regime and, increasingly, what many see as the failure of the current government to tackle social issues, coupled with the monetary and fiscal discipline of the current government to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. However, the ANC's social housing policy has produced some improvement in living conditions in many areas by redirecting fiscal spending and improving the efficiency of the tax collection system.     Politics          The central area of Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa.       South Africa has a bicameral parliament: the 90 members of the National Council of Provinces (the upper house); and the four hundred members of the National Assembly (the lower house). Members of the lower house are elected on a population basis by proportional representation: half of the members are elected from national lists and half are elected from provincial lists. Ten members are elected to represent each province in the National Council of Provinces, regardless of the population of the province. Elections for both chambers are held every five years. The government is formed in the lower house, and the leader of the majority party in the National Assembly is the president.   Current South African politics are dominated by the African National Congress (ANC), which received 69.7 percent of the vote during the 2004 general election and 66.3 percent of the vote in the 2006 municipal election. The main challenger to the ANC's rule is the Democratic Alliance party, which received 12.4 percent of the vote in the 2004 election and 14.8 percent in the 2006 election. The leader of this party is Tony Leon. The formerly dominant New National Party, which introduced apartheid through its predecessor, the National Party, has suffered increasing humiliation at election polls since 1994, and finally voted to disband. It chose to merge with the ANC on April 9, 2005. Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the Inkatha Freedom Party, which mainly represents  Zulu  voters, and the Independent Democrats, who took 6.97 percent and 1.7 percent of the vote, respectively, in the 2004 election.     Administrative divisions   When apartheid ended in 1994, the South African government had to integrate the formerly independent and semi-independent Bantustans into the political structure. To this end, it abolished the four former provinces of South Africa (Cape Province, Natal, Orange Free State, and Transvaal) and replaced them with nine fully integrated provinces. The new provinces are typically much smaller than the former provinces, and theoretically were established in order to give local governments more resources to distribute over smaller areas.   The nine provinces are further subdivided into 52 districts, six of which are metropolitan, and 46 district municipalities. The 46 district municipalities are further subdivided into 231 local municipalities. The district municipalities also contain 20 district management areas (mostly game parks) which are directly governed by the district municipalities. The six metropolitan municipalities perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.     Military   South Africa's armed forces, known as the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), were created in 1994. In recent years, it has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa and been involved in operations in  Lesotho , the  Democratic Republic of the Congo , and  Burundi , among others. It has also participated as a part of multinational  U.N.  peacekeeping forces.   South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program in the 1970s and may have conducted a nuclear test over the  Atlantic Ocean  in 1979. It has since renounced its nuclear program and, after destroying its small nuclear arsenal, signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991. It is the only African country to have successfully developed nuclear weapons and, to date, the only country in the world to have voluntarily dismantled its entire nuclear weapons arsenal.     Geography       Map of South Africa.       South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more than 1,550 mi (2,500 km) and across two  oceans , (the  Atlantic  and the  Indian ). It borders the countries of  Namibia ,  Botswana ,  Zimbabwe ,  Mozambique , and  Swaziland . South Africa is the world's 25th-largest country and is nearly twice the size of the  U.S.  state of Texas. Njesuthi in the Drakensberg at 3,408 m is the highest peak in South Africa.   South Africa has a great variety of climate zones, from the extreme  desert  of the southern  Namib  in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with  Mozambique  and the  Indian Ocean . From the east, the land quickly rises over a mountainous escarpment toward the interior plateau known as the Highveld. Even though South Africa is classified as semi-arid, there is considerable variation in climate as well as  topography .   South Africa has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the Prince Edward Islands, consisting of Marion Island and Prince Edward Island (not to be confused with the Canadian province of the same name).     Flora and fauna          Fynbos, a floral kingdom unique to South Africa, is found near Cape Town.       South Africa has more than 20,000 different  plants , or about 10 percent of all the known  species  of plants on  Earth , making it particularly rich in plant  biodiversity . But while it has a great wealth of flowering plants, it has few  forests . Only one percent of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain along the  Indian Ocean . South Africa has lost extensive acreage of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to overpopulation, sprawling development patterns, and deforestation during the nineteenth century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species, with many posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources.  Pine  trees are being removed from all of South Africa, to allow indigenous fynbos and Afromontane forests to be re-established.    Numerous  mammals  are found in the bushveld habitats, which is mainly in the northeast, including Kruger National Park and the Mala Mala Reserve, as well as in the far north in the Waterberg Biosphere.     Economy          Durban, well-known resort city on the Indian Ocean coast and site of Africa's largest commercial ports.       By  U.N.  classification South Africa is a middle-income country with an abundant supply of resources; well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors; a stock exchange that ranks among the ten largest in the world; and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centers throughout the region. South Africa's per capita GDP positions the country as one of the 50 wealthiest in the world.   In many respects, South Africa is developed; however, this development is primarily centered in four areas, namely Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Pretoria/Johannesburg. Beyond these four economic centers, development is marginal and  poverty  still reigns despite government strategies. Large income gaps and a dual economy designate South Africa as developing; South Africa has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world. Growth rates in the last ten years are helping lower unemployment, but daunting economic problems remain. Other problems are crime, corruption, and  HIV / AIDS .   At the start of 2000, President Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment by relaxing restrictive labor laws, stepping up the pace of privatization, and cutting unneeded governmental spending. His policies face strong opposition from organized labor. It is estimated that South Africa accounts for up to 30 percent of the  gross domestic product  of the entire African continent. South Africa is also the continent's largest energy producer and consumer.   In 2003, 21.5 percent of the adult South African population was estimated to be  HIV  positive. [2]  The government has recently, after much delay, devoted substantial resources to fighting this pandemic. A study from the  African Journal of AIDS Research  showed the infection rate starting to level off, from a 4.2 percent to a 1.7 percent infection rate for 1549 year olds, and  AIDS  deaths peaking at 487,320 in 2008.   Refugees from poorer neighboring countries abound, with immigrants from the  Democratic Republic of the Congo ,  Mozambique ,  Zimbabwe ,  Malawi , and many others representing a large portion of the informal sector. With high unemployment levels, many poorer South Africans resent immigrants, who are seen to be depriving them of jobs, a feeling given credibility by the fact that many South African employers have employed migrants from other countries for lower pay than South African citizens, especially in the  construction , tourism,  agriculture , and domestic service industries. Illegal immigrants are also heavily involved in informal trading. [3]  Many immigrants continue to live in poor conditions, and the immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994. [4]     Agriculture          Workers planting on a farm in the central area of Mpumalanga.              Farm workers       South Africa has a large  agricultural  sector and is a net exporter of farm products; agricultural exports have constituted 8 percent of South Africa's total exports for the past five years. The agricultural industry contributes around 10 percent of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual laborers and contributing around 2.6 percent of GDP for the nation. [5]  Due to the aridity of the land, only 13.5 percent can be used for crop production, and only 3 percent is considered high-potential land. [6]   Although the commercial farming sector is relatively well-developed, people in some rural areas still survive on  subsistence agriculture . It is the eighth largest wine producer in the world, and the eleventh largest producer of sunflower seed. South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products and foodstuffs, the largest number of exported items being  sugar ,  grapes ,  citrus ,  nectarines , wine and  deciduous  fruit. The largest locally produced crop is  maize  (corn), and it has been estimated that 9 million tons are produced every year, with 7.4 million tons being consumed.  Livestock  are also popular on South African farms, with the country producing 85 percent of all meat consumed. The dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing employment for sixty thousand farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of around forty thousand others. [7]   In recent years, the agricultural sector has introduced several reforms, some of which are controversial, such as land reform and the deregulation of the market for agricultural products. Land reform has been criticized by both farmers' groups and landless workers, the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough, and the former alleging racist treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to Zimbabwe's land reform policy may develop. [8]  The sector continues to face problems, with increased foreign competition and crime being two of the major challenges for the industry. The government has been accused of not devoting enough time and money to tackle the problem of farm attacks as opposed to other forms of violent crime. [9]     Demographics   South Africa is a nation of over 47 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and beliefs. In the 2005 census, black Africans were 75.4 percent of the population, whites 14.3 percent, colored 8.8 percent, and Indians or Asians 2.5 percent.   Though the major part of the population classified itself as African or black, those people are not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. Major ethnic groups include the  Zulu , Xhosa, Basotho (South Sotho), Bapedi (North Sotho), Venda, Tswana, Tsonga, Swazi, and Ndebele, all of which speak Bantu languages.   Some, such as the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi, and Venda groups, are unique to South Africa. Other groups are distributed across the borders with South Africa's neighbors: The Basotho group is also the major ethnic group in  Lesotho . The Tswana ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of  Botswana . The Swazi ethnic group is the major ethnic group in  Swaziland . The Ndebele ethnic group is also found in Matabeleland in  Zimbabwe , where they are known as the Matabele. These Ndebele people are, however, in effect  Zulu  people because the language they speak is Zulu and they are the descendants of a faction under the warrior Mzilikazi (ca. 1790 - 1868) that escaped persecution from Shaka by migrating to their current territory. The Tsonga ethnic group is also found in southern  Mozambique , where they are known as the Shangaan.   The white population descends largely from colonial immigrants:  Dutch , German,  French   Huguenot , and  British . Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into the Afrikaners, who speak Afrikaans, and English-speaking groups, many of whom originated from British immigrants. Small communities that immigrated over the last century retain the use of other languages. The white population is on the decrease due to a low birthrate and emigration; as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high crime rate and the government's  affirmative action  policies.   The term ""colored"" is still largely used for the people of mixed race descended from slaves brought in from East and Central Africa, the indigenous Khoisan who lived in the Cape at the time, indigenous African blacks, whites (mostly the  Dutch /Afrikaner and British settlers) as well as an admixture of Javanese, Malay,  Indian , Malagasy and other Europeans (such as Portuguese) and Asian blood (such as  Burmese ). The majority speak Afrikaans. Khoisan is a term used to describe two separate groups, physically similar in that they were light-skinned and small in stature. The  Khoikhoi , who were called  Hottentots  by the Europeans, were pastoralists and were effectively annihilated; the  San , called Bushmen by the Europeans, were  hunter-gatherers . Within what is known as the Colored community, more recent immigrants will also be found: Coloreds from the former Rhodesia (now  Zimbabwe ) and  Namibia  and immigrants of mixed descent from India and  Burma  who were welcomed to the Cape when the latter countries received their independence.   The major part of the Asian population of the country is Indian in origin, many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the  sugar  plantations of the eastern coastal area then known as Natal. There is also a significant group of Chinese South Africans (approximately 100,000).     HIV/AIDS   As in many sub-Saharan African countries, the spread of  AIDS  is a serious problem in South Africa. [10]  The link between  HIV , a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by the president and the health minister, who insisted that the many deaths in the country were due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, not HIV. [11]   AIDS  is affecting mainly those who are sexually active, which means the demographics of the country are slowly changing. Most deaths are of people who are also economically active, resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners. This results in many  orphans  who frequently depend on the state for care and financial support. It is estimated that there are 1,100,000 orphans in South Africa. [12]  Elderly people, traditionally supported by younger members of the family, are also becoming more and more dependent on the state for financial support.     Culture          Decorated houses, Drakensberg Mountains.       It may be argued that there is no ""single"" culture in South Africa because of its ethnic diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine. In addition to food,  music  and dance feature prominently.   There is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during  apartheid  have since begun to sing in traditional African languages and have developed a unique style called Kwaito. Of note is Brenda Fassie, who launched to fame with her song ""Weekend Special,"" which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include Ladysmith Black Mambazo, while the Soweto String Quartet performs classic music with an African flavor. White and colored South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles, including such Western metal bands such as Seether. Afrikaans music covers multiple genres, such as the contemporary Steve Hofmeyr and the punk rock band Fokofpolisiekar. Crossover artists such as Johnny Clegg and his bands Juluka and Savuka have enjoyed success underground, publicly, and abroad.   The country's black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that traditional dance and music survive; as blacks have become increasingly urbanized and westernized, aspects of traditional culture are declining.   Asians, predominantly of  Indian  origin, preserve their own cultural heritage, languages, and religious beliefs, being either Christian,  Hindu , or Sunni Muslim.   South Africa has also had a large influence in the Scouting movement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of  Robert Baden-Powell  (the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s. The South African Scout Association was one of the first youth organizations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa.     Notes       Sarah Manners.

The most easterly of the Caribbean islands, it lies about 100 mi (160 km) east of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Area: 166 sq mi (430 sq km). Population (2005 est.): 270,000. Capital:  Bridgetown . More than nine-tenths of the population is of African ancestry. Language: English (official). Religion: Christianity (mostly Protestant). Currency: Barbados dollar. Largely covered by a layer of coral, Barbados is low and flat except in its north-central part; its highest point is Mount Hillaby, at 1,115 ft (340 m). There is little surface water. The island is almost encircled by coral reefs. Bridgetown is its only seaport. The economy is based on tourism and sugar, while the offshore financial sector is growing. Barbados is a constitutional monarchy with two legislative houses; its chief of state is the British monarch, represented by a governor-general, and the head of government is the prime minister. The island was probably inhabited originally by  Arawak  and later by Carib Indians. Spaniards may have landed by 1518, and by 1536 they had apparently wiped out the Indian population. Barbados was settled by the English in the 1620s. Slaves were brought in to work the sugar plantations, which were especially prosperous in the 17th – 18th century. The British Empire abolished slavery in 1834, and all the Barbados slaves were freed by 1838. In 1958 Barbados joined the West Indies Federation. When the latter dissolved in 1962, Barbados sought independence from Britain, which it gained in 1966.

Extending 21 miles by 14, it is a little larger than the Isle of Wight. It was uninhabited in 1627 when settled by the English, who began growing sugar cane in the 1630s. The capital is Bridgetown and tourism is augmented by light industry.                            US History Encyclopedia:    Barbados       Home  >  Library  >  History, Politics & Society  >  US History Encyclopedia          The easternmost of the Caribbean's  Windward Islands , Barbados is known as much for its tropical breezes as for its  sugarcane  fields. The earliest inhabitants were the Amaraks, Amerindians from Venezuela who are believed to have arrived around 1623 B.C. In 1200, the cannibalistic Caribs conquered the Amaraks. They, in turn, were conquered, enslaved, and finally decimated by  smallpox  when the Spanish arrived in the Caribbean in 1492. But Spain failed to colonize the island, leaving the British to settle Barbados in 1627 and introduce sugarcane as a major crop. The American colonies had close ties to Barbados for a number of reasons, including the fact that in 1649, the Barbadian Society of Gentlemen Adventurers settled what became known as the Carolinas. Many Carolinians (North and South) still trace their roots to Barbados. Barbados's climate also gained renown and in 1751 a young George Washington went there on his only trip abroad. He brought his  ailing  half brother to the island in search of a miracle tropical cure. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Barbados was a frequent exporter of sugar, ginger,  molasses , and cotton to the American colonies. Those crops took a terrible toll on Barbados's West African slaves, brought there by Dutch merchants. (Many other slaves died en route to the island's plantations.) In 1834, slavery was technically abolished on Barbados; after the slaves served a mandatory four-year "" apprenticeship ,"" some  seventy  thousand newly free islanders of African descent celebrated their true  emancipation  in 1838. British rule ended in 1966, when the island was finally granted full independence. Its bicameral parliament, however, remains British in style, with a Senate appointed by the governor general, who represents the British monarchy, and a House of Assembly elected by the voters. The U.S.-Barbadian relations have always been strong. From 1956 to 1978, the U.S. operated a naval base there, and the two nations also signed a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) in 1996. The U.S. also supports Barbadian economic development and provides aid to combat narcotics trafficking. While sugarcane is still a  mainstay  crop (Barbados's fifteen hundred small farms produce some sixty thousand tons of sugar annually), tourism is the island's leading industry. With the development in the 1990s of the Port Charles Marina in Speightstown and the opening of additional tourist facilities around the island, Barbados has a sunny future as a popular destination.

The capital and largest city is  Bridgetown . Land, People, and Economy The island, E of St. Vincent, in the Windward Islands, is the easternmost of the Caribbean islands. It is low and rises gradually toward its highest point at Mt. Hillaby (1,104 ft/336 m). Although there is ample rainfall from June to December, there are no rivers, and water must be pumped from subterranean caverns. About 90% of the population is of African descent, 4% are of European descent, and about 6% are of Asian or mixed descent. English-speaking, the majority of Barbadians are Protestant. The porous soil and moderate warmth are excellent for the cultivation of sugarcane, which was historically the island's main occupation. Today, sugar and molasses remain important products and are the country's largest exports. The healthful and equable climate makes it a very popular tourist resort, and tourism is the country's largest industry. Manufacturing (largely chemicals, electrical components, clothing, and rum) and banking are growing sectors of the economy. The United States, other Caribbean islands, and Great Britain are the main trading partners. History Although it was probably originally inhabited by Arawaks, it was uninhabited when the English expeditionaries first settled there in 1627 (1605, according to local tradition). Barbados remained a British colony until independence was granted in 1966. During the 19th cent. it was the administrative headquarters of the Windward Islands, but in 1885 it became a separate colony. It later was a member of the short-lived  West Indies Federation  (195862). The island became an independent associated state of the  Commonwealth of Nations  in 1966. The bicameral parliament consists of a 17-member Senate appointed by the governor-general and a 17-member elected House of Representatives. The Democratic Labor party (DLP) held power from 1986 until 1994, when the Barbados Labor party (BLP) won a legislative majority; Owen Arthur became prime minister. Arthur and the BLP retained power after the 1999 and 2003 elections. Bibliography See K. R. Hope,  Economic Development in the Caribbean  (1986); H.

Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance.

Offshore finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners. The government continues its efforts to reduce unemployment, to encourage direct foreign investment, and to privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. The economy contracted in 2002-03 mainly due to a decline in tourism. Growth was positive in 2005-06, as economic conditions in the US and Europe moderately improved.

(March 2008)       Illegal immigration  is a serious political problem  in India , with widely differing estimates of the number of such migrants. In places this has led to outbreaks of xenophobic violence, particularly against those perceived to be  Bangladeshi .

The  Government of Bangladesh  claims that ""there is not a single Bangladeshi migrant in India"" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Drain on Government   It is extremely hard to distinguish between illegal Bangaldeshis and local  Bengali  speakers [ 4 ] .  The Hindu  has reported a case where Bangladeshis have been able to secure ration and voter identity cards [ 5 ] .   Assam spent Rs.1.7 billion between January 2001 and September 2006, which resulted in identification of 9,149 foreigners, only 1,864 could be deported back to Bangladesh. This amounts to Rs. 180,000 spent to deport an illegal Bangladeshi [ 6 ]   India is building a fence along its entire border with Bangladesh [ 7 ] .     [ edit ]   Allegations of terrorism and crime   Indian intelligence sources claim that terrorist groups have been recruiting Bangladeshis in India. [ 8 ]  Indian police have alleged that some Bangladeshi insurgent groups were involved in several terrorist incidents in India. [ 9 ]  The  Government of Bangladesh  have generally denied these reports. [ 10 ]  Some commentators have attributed the rise of terrorist attacks in  North-East India  to the rise of illegal immigration. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Human trafficking   The Centre for Women and Children Studies estimated in 1998 that 27,000 Bangladeshis have been forced into prostitution in India [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . Ahmedabad Crime Branch (ACB) has investigated a prostitution racket run by a Bangladeshi couple living in Ahmedabad. It believed over 500 women had been coerced into prostitution by illegal Bangladeshi agents in Gujarat. [ 14 ] . [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Settlement   Indian newspapers reported that ""the state government has reports that illegal Bangladeshi migrants have trickled into parts of rural Bengal, including  Nandigram [ 16 ] , over the years, and settled down as sharecroppers with the help of local Left leaders. Though a majority of these immigrants became tillers, they lacked documents to prove the ownership of land [ 16 ] "".     [ edit ]   Politics   Allegations exist that other parties such as the  Bharatiya Janata Party  and the  Indian National Congress  have discriminated against Bengali-speaking Muslims. [ 17 ] . Even though it must be noted that the number of Bengali-speaking muslims has increased multifold since independence, suggesting that many of these Bengali-speaking muslims are maybe illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.     [ edit ]   Court cases   In August 2008, the  Delhi  High Court dismissed a petition by a Bangladeshi national against her deportation. The High Court ruled that the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants ""pose a danger to India's internal security"".

(The term is also sometimes used to refer to  multiculturalism  within an organisation. This article does not currently cover that alternative meaning.)   There is a general consensus among mainstream  anthropologists  that humans first emerged in Africa about two million years ago  [ 1 ] . Since then they have spread throughout the world, successfully adapting to widely differing conditions and to periodic cataclysmic changes in local and global climate. The many separate societies that emerged around the globe differed markedly from each other, and many of these differences persist to this day.   As well as the more obvious  cultural differences  that exist between people, such as language, dress and traditions, there are also significant variations in the way societies organise themselves, in their shared conception of  morality , and in the ways they interact with their environment. It is debatable whether these differences are merely incidental artefacts arising from patterns of  human migration  or whether they represent an  evolutionary  trait that is key to our success as a species. By analogy with  biodiversity , which is thought to be essential to the long-term survival of life on earth, it can be argued that cultural diversity may be vital for the long-term survival of humanity; and that the conservation of  indigenous cultures  may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species and  ecosystems  is to life in general. The General Conference of  UNESCO  took this position in 2001, asserting in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity that  ""...cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature"" [ 2 ]   This position is rejected by some people, however, on several grounds. Firstly, like most  evolutionary  accounts of  human nature , the importance of cultural diversity for survival may be an  un-testable hypothesis , which can neither be proved nor disproved. Secondly, it can be argued that it is unethical deliberately to conserve ""less developed"" societies, because this will deny people within those societies the benefits of technological and medical advances enjoyed by those of us in the ""developed"" world. Finally, there are some people, particularly those with strong religious beliefs, who maintain that it is in the best interests of individuals and of humanity as a whole that all people adhere to the single model for society that they deem to be correct. For example,  fundamentalist   evangelist   missionary  organisations such as the  New Tribes Mission  actively work to reduce cultural diversity by seeking out remote  tribal societies , converting them to their own faith, and inducing them to remodel their society after its principles. [ 3 ]   Cultural diversity is tricky to quantify, but a good indication is thought to be a count of the number of languages spoken in a region or in the world as a whole. By this measure, there are signs that we may be going through a period of precipitous decline in the world's cultural diversity. Research carried out in the 1990s by  David Crystal  (Honorary Professor of  Linguistics  at the  University of Wales, Bangor ) suggested that at that time, on average, one language was falling into disuse every two weeks. He calculated that if that rate of  language death  were to continue, then by the year 2100 more than 90% of the languages currently spoken in the world will have gone extinct.  [ 4 ]   Overpopulation ,  immigration  and  imperialism  (of both the militaristic and cultural kind) are reasons that have been suggested to explain any such decline.   There are several international organisations that work towards protecting threatened societies and cultures, including  Survival International  and  UNESCO . The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, adopted by 185 Member States in 2001, represents the first international standard-setting instrument aimed at preserving and promoting cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue [ 5 ] .   The  European Commission -funded  Network of Excellence on ""Sustainable Development in a Diverse World""  (known as ""SUS.DIV"") builds upon the UNESCO Declaration to investigate the relationship between cultural diversity and  sustainable development .

clueweb09-en0003-36-30719	"   Sociology 304   Notes for January 21, 1999   Diversity in Society       Issues related to diversity and difference have become key aspects of contemporary sociological approaches and theorizing. Perhaps these have always been a key feature Marx and Engels examined class differences and their origin; Durkheim was concerned with social order in a situation where differences based on the division of labour emerged; Weber provided an analysis of group formation, definition, and action; and earlier twentieth century sociology studied and theorized about ethnicity, class, and social organization.    In the current period however, there appears to be a greater concern with issues related to diversity and difference than there did in earlier sociological approaches. Among the types of terms, language, and approaches taken in contemporary sociology are:       Diversity ethnic and cultural.    Difference and inequality.    Difference troubles (Seidman).    ""New"" voices and new sources of difference. Earlier unheard or not represented.    Individuality and individual choice.    Multiple sources of identity and group membership.    New family forms or changed household structures.    Some of the sources of concern and attention may be:      Perceptions of a change in traditional forms of social organization.    Changes in social structures and traditional forms of social organization.    Lack of representation for those not represented or heard previously.    Demands for recognition of minority group identity (Kymlicka, p. 10).    Concerns related to social cohesion, social order, and integration.    One of Kymlicka arguments in  Multicultural Citizenship  is that the various forms of diversity require analysis and recognition if the groups are to be accommodated in Canada. The recognition and extension of group rights is necessary so that individuals within these groups are able to fully participate in Canadian society, with rights that equal those of other citizens. For example, he opens his book noting that ""Most countries today are culturally diverse"" (p. 1). As evidence he cites that number of ethnic groups, language groups, independent states, and a set of what he considers divisive or potentially divisive issues such as land claims, language rights, educational policies, and national symbols. At the conclusion of  Multicultural Citizenship , Kymlicka raises the issue of deep diversity the situation Canada faces with (i) many diverse groups within the country, and (ii) diverse ways of belonging to the country.   This raises the issue of the meaning of diversity, the extent of diversity, how has diversity changed, what a definition of diversity, and how can diversity be measured. In  Who Pays for the Kids ? Folbre raises similar issues, although in a different way. She is concerned less with rights and more with individual and collective identities and actions. For example, she notes:      Membership in one given group (for example, women) is not necessarily any more important than membership in another given group (for example, African-Americans). Individuals cannot be located by a single set of coordinates, because they operate in many different collective dimensions, within many different chosen and given groups. Nor can they be located by a list of all the given groups to which they belong, by simply dding upof separate positions. The interaction between different dimensions of collective identity affects the choices individuals make about which collective interests to pursue. (N. Folbre,  Who Pays for the Kids ? pp. 52-53).       This section of the notes raises a number of issues related to the extent and meaning of diversity, and changes in diversity. These issues and approaches are important in this section of the course and in the next section dealing with social reproduction. More generally, these are issues that are of concern in many parts of contemporary sociology.       1. Increased Diversity?      What is the evidence for increasing diversity?    Population trends. Different sources of immigration today, as compared with immigration in earlier periods. See data on immigration and population trends.    Wide range of lifestyles. Contrast with traditional uniform lifestyles of specific groups in specific areas, e.g. Amish, Hutterites.    Many languages, religions, cultural practices, dress, food.    Increasing contact among different cultures. Communications, transportation, trade mean that these are expressed in Canada to a greater extent than in earlier periods.    Much of the argument may be related to those of visible minorities, just as the focus was on non-British/non-French in the early twentieth century. (Racism, xenophobia, suspicion of newcomers).    Multiculturalism, pluralism, and survival of various ethnic cultures.    Political demands of various groups.        2. Increased Homogeneity?      Dominant Anglo culture outside Quebec and French culture within Quebec.    Globalization and global culture. Media, advertising, entertainment, commodities.    Modernization, industrialization, rationalization. Ritzer McDonaldization of society.    Social class developments similar across countries as a result of industrialization. Property and social class. One large division develops (proletariat and capitalist).    Similar laws, rules, norms governing acceptable and desirable bounds of behaviour.    Assimilation and integration of immigrants. All are ""Canadians"" by second or third generation. The increased diversity is only a temporary phenomenon.    Citizenship rights similar. Charter of Rights and Freedoms.        3. Some Causes of Changes in Diversity and Homogeneity      Increased trade, communications, transportation, and migration. The ""diverse"" cultures have presumably existed for a long time, and we were not aware of them, or did not have to interact with them until contact among these has been increased. The forms of contact may be quite different depending on whether people or goods move. See Williams,  The Year 2000 , p. 177. Note the importance of the unit of analysis here issues related to changes in diversity are at some level below that of the world as a whole, usually at the national, regional, or local level.    How is diversity created? Capitalism and markets. Focus on immigration may ignore the sources of emigrants. Emigrants have tended to come from countries in the early stages of industrialization, as they are displaced from traditional occupations and industries. Communities had often lived for a long time in relative isolation or limited contact with a few other communities, thereby developing a set of cultural practices that were different from other communities. The development of capitalism dislocated, relocated, and destroyed communities, peoples, and cultures. ""Capitalist textile-production, ironmaking, mining, grain production and a host of other industrial processes set in train immigrations and emigrations, aggregations and depopulations on a vast scale"" (Williams, p. 185).    Origin and idea of the nation-state. The nation-state is of relatively recent origin, in previous eras there were a variety of political arrangements, ones that often disconnected politics from language and culture. Capitalist development and mercantilism led to the unification of territories that had previously been ruled by different rulers and had different cultures, often different languages. e.g. France had various regions, each with a different language (Occitan, Provencal, Breton, Alsatian, French) and a different culture, although they were generally considered as part of some French kingdom. Each of the European countries became unified and this was part of the era of the development of capitalism. Single markets, trade, and economy with a single set of laws that could be applied widely over a particular region like France. This meant the imposition of a single language that by the 20th century became dominant throughout each of these countries.    Homogenizing influence of global capitalism. Multinational corporations, expansion of trade and financial flows. Questions of the relevance of the nation-state and its ability to exercise much control over economic actions now.    New technologies, the internet, virtualization, cyberculture, and the virtual class. Kroker and Weinstein.         4. What is Diversity?      Diverse cultural practices but similar ways of behaving. Kymlicka pp. 87-88 notes how Quebec today is probably much more similar to English Canada than it was before 1940. See examples on p. 88. And both parts of Canada are very similar to the United States. Same process in Western Europe. Liberalization and modernization have created countries and cultures that are similar to each other but at the same time have considerable diversity, perhaps increased diversity, within each country. Kymlicka notes that commentators have often assumed that the result of this similarity between, but diversity within cultures would be a decline in national identity and nationalism. But the result has often been the opposite, especially in Quebec.    Diversity within cultures, between cultures, boundaries between cultures. Kymlicka notes the very different features of (i) two cultures living side by side with little cultural interaction (the two solitudes of French and English in Canada) and (ii) the effects of polyethnicity where aspects of different cultures are incorporated into a single culture.    Good life, end values, modes of behaviour. Within countries and within cultures that are diverse, there are many different conceptions of what a good life means, and the diversity of such conceptions might be a way of defining diversity. At the same time, there may be a generally agreed upon set of shared values, especially political values. Another possibility is a shared conception of justice. Kymlicka notes that the Canadian Citizen Forum of 1994 found seven common values among Canadians see p. 187.    Another possibility, perhaps more sociological, is that there are generally agreed upon norms for action and interaction and for social and collective behaviour. This may have been Durkheim idea of the social forces that stood behind organic solidarity agreed upon norms that are expressed in laws. These may not differ all that much between countries. In Canada the Charter of Rights and Freedoms sets out a number of generally agreed up norms.    Durkheim mechanical and organic solidarity. Latter said to be associated with greater difference, individualism, etc. but Durkheim viewed it as also creating a new form of social unity.        Summary of Diversity   Diversity within and between. Increase in former and decline in latter at least in some areas. Unit of analysis.   Note that diversity may increase in some ways and decline in others. For example, within society likely have more similar access to education and health resources today, but outcomes may be more different in variety of occupational results, or differences in lifestyle and cultural choices may be greater.    There is little doubt that ethnic diversity as expressed in languages, cultures, and skin colour have increased in Canada in recent years. Whether and how long this trend will continue is not clear and it depends on the extent and type of globalization that takes place in coming years. Large-scale population movements across national borders may continue and the nation-state itself may no longer be the major geographical unit for organizing society. If current trends continue, there will certainly continue to be greater contact and transmission of ideas, values, and cultures among the people of the world.   At the same time, there are strong homogenizing trends the consumer culture of capitalism, multinational corporations, and the modernist force of industrialization. This creates societies that are more similar to each other, with some of the traditional cultural differences declining in importance or visibility. Within Canada and the United States there are some strong forces of homogenization for the newcomers similar laws, rules, and norms, the English language (or French in Quebec), citizenship, and the desire to integrate and participate in the economy and society.    Further, the differences among the newcomers may seem to be greater than what they really are the language and cultural differences are not inherent in the individuals, but are a result of having lived in a different culture. The newcomers themselves may retain much of their original culture, but the children of the newcomers and subsequent generations are likely to become integrated in a great variety of ways.   In summary, there are many forces for diversity and many forces for homogeneity. Both of these operate at the same time, and it is important to attempt to sort these out. Kymlicka notes that industrial countries have generally become more similar to each other, with each country having greater cultural diversity within the country. Note though that this is greater diversity within the framework of the dominant culture, rather than a variety of separate cultures being expressed within each of these countries.       Diversity in Population Trends in Canada   Canada Changing Immigrant Population  (Statistics Canada, catalogue number 96-311E) notes ""Immigration has played a role in creating a culturally diverse Canada"" (p. 17) and titles the section ""Greater Diversity in the Canadian Mosaic.""       Aboriginal population . The original population of what is now Canada was originally entirely First Nations, each with their own form of social organization, with their similarities and differences. The size of the population of aboriginal descent fell dramatically but has recently begun to rebound and now is probably around 2% of Canadian population. The main groups are status and non-status Indian, Inuit, and Métis, with many different First Nations Cree, Huron, Ojibway, etc. Indian and Northern Affairs notes that there are 608 First Nations, comprising 52 Nations or cultural groups, with more than 50 languages. (http://www.inac.gc.ca/strenght/demogr.html, January 20, 1998).    Charter Europeans French . There were relatively few immigrants from France (perhaps only 10,000 French immigrants to New France) but New France had extremely high rates of natural population growth (excess of births over deaths). Those descended from French immigrants constitute approximately 25% of the population of Canada, although there was considerable inter-marriage with other groups.    Charter Europeans   British . There were many more immigrants from the British Isles than from France, and this become the dominant group in numbers and in political and economic influence. By 1901, 57% of population was of British origin, 31% of French origin, and 12% of other origins (Driedger,  The Ethnic Factor , p. 94). Today it is likely that between thirty and forty per cent of the population is of British origin. However, with extensive intermarriage between those of British and other origins, it is not clear how to count all of those with multiple ethnic origins.    Multi-Europeans . These are those of European origin, but not of English or French ancestry. Multi-Europeans likely accounted for only about five per cent in 1871, but by 1981 they accounted for about one-third of the population (with 27% French origin and 40% British origin). These other Europeans came from practically all European countries and settled throughout Canada west of Quebec, and especially in the Prairies. Apart from aboriginal, French, and British, the diversity of cultures that existed in the first two-thirds of this century was primarily that of the various European cultures.    Visible Minorities . There were very few people from outside Europe and the United States that came to Canada before 1960. Beginning in the 1960s, immigration regulations began to change and the  Immigration Act  of 1967 led to a major change in the nature of immigration to Canada. The adoption of the ""point system"" that evaluated potential immigrants for their education and skills resulted in increased immigrant numbers from Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa. Initially fairly limited in total numbers, the bulk of immigrants to Canada in recent years has come from outside Europe. By 1996, 8.1% of the Canadian population identified themselves as of Asian, Arab, or African origin, with another 1.5% identifying themselves as of Latin American or Caribbean origin. The result is that there is approximately ten per cent of the population of Canada with non-European, non-aboriginal ancestry.       Under the  Employment Equity Act  of 1986, people of certain ancestry are recognized as  visible minorities . From the  1996 Census Dictionary  (Statistics Canada, catalogue number 92-531-XPE, p. 97), visible minorities are defined as ""persons (other than Aboriginal persons), who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour. The categories listed (p. 98) are Chinese, South Asian (e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Punjabi, Sri Lankan), Black (e.g., African, Haitian, Jamaican, Somali), Arab/West Asian (e.g., Armenian, Egyptian, Iranian, Lebanese, Moroccan), Filipino, South East Asian (e.g., Cambodian, Indonesian, Laotian, Vietnamese), Latin American, Japanese, Korean, or other. In the 1996 Census of Canada, 11.2 per cent of the population identified themselves as visible minorities. For Saskatchewan, 26,945 or 2.8 per cent of the population said they belonged to a visible minority.        Result in 1999?  The aboriginal population is approximately 2% (although DIAND notes Canadians of Aboriginal ancestry may be more than 4% of the Canadian population), with those of French ancestry about 25%, British 30-40%, other European 30-40%, and visible minorities 11-12%. For 1991 figures, see Statistics Canada,  Canada Changing Immigrant Population , by Jane Badets and Tina W. L. Chui, Focus on Canada series, Ottawa, Statistics Canada, 1994, p. 20. Catalogue number 96-311E. In this table, note the differences in the distributions of immigrant ethnic origins from before 1961 and more recently. In particular, there are much larger percentages of recent immigrants from Asian, Arab, and African sources, compared to earlier periods.     The table, ""Single and multiple ethnic origin responses, 1996 Census"" shows the distribution of ethnic origins for the Canadian population in 1996 and for the provinces from Quebec to Saskatchewan. Note the difficulty of accurately determining ethnic origins because one-half of the Saskatchewan population states multiple origins and another ten per cent say they are of Canadian origin.     Immigration . In 1951, the ten leading source countries of immigrants were Britain, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, France, U.S., Belgium, Yugoslavia, and Denmark. In 1998, they were China, India, Hong Kong, Philippines, Pakistan, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, United States, and Russia. Note that these ten leading countries accounted for about one-half of all immigrants to Canada. In the 1980s, immigration from Vietnam was also large and in the mid-1990s, there was considerable immigration from the countries that were part of the former Yugoslavia.    Also note the shift in birthplaces for the immigrant population of Canada, as registered in the 1996 Census. There has been a considerable increase in the number of recent immigrants from Asian countries, the Caribbean, and Latin America, and a considerable decline in the numbers from European countries.   Conclusion . As indicators of cultural diversity, the above figures have a number of problems associated with them. Immigrants may not identify themselves with the country of their origin or may not take on the culture that many may assume is associated with that country. The statistical approach in terms of population structure does provide some indication of increasing cultural diversity, but the meaning of the numbers must also be considered.       Notes for January 21, 1999.       Back to Sociology 304 Winter, 1999         "

Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic state at a nexus where numerous Eurasian civilizations have interacted, traded, migrated through, and often fought. Invaders and conquerors included the Persian Empire,  Alexander the Great , Muslim  Arabs , Turkic peoples, the  Mongols , the  British Empire , and the  Soviet Union . The Afghans historically have fiercely fought against outside forces that threatened their independence.   The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 was heroically resisted by Afghan guerrilla forces, with covert material assistance from the  United States ; the invasion also marked the beginning of the downfall of the Soviet Union, which experienced the limits of expansionism. Once Soviet forces left Afghanistan in 1989, however, neglect by the United States and its allies in rebuilding the war-devastated country led to internal factional strife, with the Taliban eventually gaining control.   In October 2001, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan to eliminate the Taliban, who had given safe-haven to the Al-Qaeda terrorists behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Although successful in installing a  democratic  government, the American war, now joined by NATO forces, against regrouped elements of the Taliban, continues to date.   The key challenge facing Afghanistan today is to build a genuine, indigenous national unity transcending tribal loyalties. Based on that, economic development could proceed, lifting per capita GDP rank from 162 of 181 nations, and extending life expectancy beyond the current 46 years.

It is bordered by  Pakistan  in the south and east,  Iran  in the west,  Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and  Tajikistan  in the north, and the People's Republic of China in the far northeast. Part of the region bordering Pakistan falls in the disputed  Kashmir  region, which is claimed by  India .   The name  Af gh nistn  translates to the Land of Afghans. The  Pashtun  people began using the term  Afghan  from at least the Islamic period. Until the nineteenth century, the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the  Kingdom of Kabul.  It has religious, ethno-linguistic, and geographic links with most of its neighbors.   At 249,984 square miles (647,500 square kilometers), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after  Myanmar ). It is comparable in size to  Somalia , and is slightly smaller than the  U.S.  state of  Texas .   The terrain comprises mostly rugged mountainsthe Hindu Kush and connected rangesplains in north and southwest, and large areas of sandy  desert  near the southern border with Pakistan. The highest point is Nowshak, at 24,557 feet (7485 meters) above sea level. The lowest point is Amu Darya at 846 feet (258 meters). Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited.   Important passes include the Unai Pass across the Sanglakh Range, and the Kotal-e Salang, connecting  Kabul  with central and northern Afghanistan. The famous Khyber Pass is in eastern Afghanistan. There are two passes from Paktika Province into Pakistan's Waziristan region, plus the Charkai River passage south of Khowst, Afghanistan. The busy Pakistan border crossing at Wesh connects Kandahar and Spin Boldak, Afghanistan, to Quetta, Pakistan.   Afghanistan has a dry, continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The sun shines for three-quarters of the yearthe nights are clearer than the days. The highlands have a mean temperature of between 50F to 60F (10C and 15C). Daily temperatures can have up to a 30F (17C) difference between the coldest and hottest time. Waves of intense cold, lasting for several days, can reach 12F below zero (minus 24C). In  Kabul , the  snow  lies for two or three monthsthe people seldom leave their houses, and sleep close to stoves. The summer heat is great everywhere, made worse in Kandahar by frequent dust storms and fiery winds. The bare rocky ridges that traverse the country absorb heat by day and radiate it by night. In the Oxus regions, a shade maximum of 110F to 120F (45C to 50C) is not uncommon. The summer  rains  that accompany the southwest  monsoon  in  India  travel up the Kabul valley as far as Laghman.          Map of Afghanistan.              Tora Bora Mountains.       Most vegetation is confined to the main ranges and their immediate off-shoots. More distant ranges are naked rock and stone. Large  conifers  grow on the Safed Koh alpine range from 6,000 to 10,000 feet (1,800 to 3,000 meters). Down to 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) grow wild olive, rock-rose, wild privet, acacias and mimosas. Scanty vegetation on the western lowest ridges is almost wholly herbal.  Mulberry , willow,  poplar , and ash  trees  grow in cultivated districts.   Damaging  earthquakes  occur in the Hindu Kush mountains.  Flooding  and  droughts  occur in the south and southwest of the country.   The country's natural resources include  gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  zinc , and iron ore in southeastern areas; precious and semi-precious stones such as  lapis ,  emerald , and azure in the northeast; and potentially significant  petroleum  and  natural gas  reserves in the north. The country also has  coal , chromite,  talc , barites,  sulfur ,  lead , and  salt .  War  has caused of these  mineral  and energy resources to remain largely untapped.   There are four major  rivers  in the country: the Amu Darya, Hari Rud, Kabul, and Helmand rivers. There are also several smaller rivers and  lakes .   Kbul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan, with population of about three million people. It is an economic and cultural center, situated 5,900 feet (1800 meters) above-sea-level in a narrow valley, and wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River. The other major cities are, in order of population size, Kandahar, Herat, Mazari Sharif, Jalalabad, Ghazni, and Kunduz.     History          The  Buddhas  of Bamyan were the largest Buddha statues in the world, dating back to the first century  C.E.  They were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001.       Excavation of prehistoric sites suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago. Historian  Arnold Toynbee  described the region as a ""roundabout of the ancient world."" Waves of migrating peoples passed through the region, leaving behind a mosaic of ethnic and linguistic groups.   Between 2000  B.C.E.  and 1200  B.C.E. , Indo-European-speaking Aryans from the north are thought to have flooded into northern Afghanistan and then spread south towards  India  and west towards Persia. They set up a nation that, during the rule of Medes (an ancient Iranian people) and Achaemenid Persians (559  B.C.E.  to 338  B.C.E. ), became known as Arynm Xaara or Airynem Vejah.   Later, during the rule of the Ashkanians (247  B.C.E.  to 226  C.E. ) and the Sassanians (226 to 651  C.E. ), the third and fourth Iranian dynasties, it was called Ernshahr, meaning ""Dominion of the Aryans,"" and included large parts of Mesopotamia, the Caucasus,  Armenia ,  Azerbaijan ,  Iran  and modern-day Central Asia (Afghanistan,  Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan,  Tajikistan ,  Kyrgyzstan , and the western part of  Pakistan .   Zoroastrianism  might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800  B.C.E.  Ancient Iranian languages, such as Avestan, may have been spoken in the region at that time.           Alexander the Great  fighting the Persian king Darius III of Persia (Pompeii mosaic, from a fourth century  B.C.E.  original Greek painting, now lost).       By 330  B.C.E. ,  Alexander the Great  had invaded Afghanistan and conquered the surrounding regions. After Alexander's brief occupation, the Hellenistic successor states of the  Seleucids  (311  B.C.E.  to 63  B.C.E. ) and Greco-Bactrians (250  B.C.E.  to 130  B.C.E. ) controlled the area, while the Mauryas from  India  annexed the southeast for a time and introduced Buddhism to the region until the area returned to Bactrian rule.   During the first century  C.E. , the Buddhist Tocharian Kushans created a vast empire there but were defeated by the Sassanids in the third century, who ruled up to the seventh century, when they were conquered by  Muslim   Arab  armies at the Battle of al-Qdisiyyah. The Arab  Abbasids  conquered the northwest section of Afghanistan by the ninth century and administered that region as part of Khorasan.   The Samanid empire existed from 875-999, the Muslim Ghaznavid Empire from 9771187, the Seljukids from 10371194, the Ghurids from 11491212, and the Timurid Dynasty existed from 1370-1506. The periods of Ghaznavids of Ghazni and Timurids of Herat are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of Afghanistan's history. The strong  Sunni  Ghaznavid Empire prevented the eastward spread of Shiism from Iran, thereby ensuring that most Muslims in Afghanistan and South Asia remained Sunnis.   In 1219, the region was overrun by the  Mongols  under  Genghis Khan , who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the Ilkhanates, and was extended further following the invasion of Timur Lang, a ruler from Central Asia.   In 1504,  Babur , a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the  Mughal Empire  with its capital at Kabul. By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups: Uzbeks to the north,  Safavids  to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self-ruled by local Afghan tribes.          Coronation of Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747, the founder of the Afghan Empire and first King of Afghanistan.       In 1709, Mirwais Khan Hotak, a local Afghan (Pashtun) from the Ghilzai clan, overthrew and killed Gurgin Khan, the Safavid governor of Kandahar Province. Khan had defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the Kandahar population to the Shia sect of  Islam . Mirwais held Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son Mir Mahmud Hotaki. In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an army to Isfahan (now in  Iran ), sacked the city and proclaimed himself Shah of Persia.   In 1738, Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns, conquered Kandahar, and occupied Ghazni, Kabul, and Lahore. In 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated. In that year, one of Nadir's commanders and personal bodyguard, Ahmad Shah Abdali, a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) at which Ahmad Shah was chosen as king. He changed his title and clan name to Durrani.   By 1751,  Ahmad Shah Durrani  and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan,  Pakistan , Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with Delhi in  India . In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in Maruf, Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He is regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. He was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah Durrani, who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was succeeded by his son Zaman Shah Durrani.   During the nineteenth century, Afghanistan struggled successfully against the colonial powers and served as a buffer state between  Russia  and British India. The three Anglo-Afghan wars (18391842, 18781880, and 1919) could have forged national unity, were it not for internal conflict. Much territory and autonomy was ceded to the  United Kingdom . It was not until King Amanullah Khan acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan regained control of its foreign affairs. During the period of British intervention, ethnic  Pashtun  territories were divided by the Durand Line, leading to strained relations between Afghanistan and British Indiaand later the new state of Pakistan.   Forty years of stability, the longest in Afghanistans history, occurred between 1933 and 1973, under the rule of Mohammed Zahir Shah. However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law, Sardar Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup. Daoud Khan and his entire family were  murdered  in 1978, when the  communist  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan launched a coup known as the Great Saur Revolution and took over the government. Many of the communists were young, recently urbanized, de-tribalized people seeking social advancement.   Opposition against, and conflict within, the series of communist governments that followed was considerable. As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States  government under President  Jimmy Carter  began to covertly fund and train anti-government Mujahideen forces, which were discontented Muslims who opposed the official  atheism  of the Marxist regime. To help communist forces, the  Soviet Union  intervened on December 24, 1979. Between 110,000 to 150,000 Soviet troops, assisted by another 100,000 pro-communist Afghan troops, were in Afghanistan.   Over five million Afghans moved into refugee camps in neighboring  Pakistan ,  Iran , and other countries. More than three million settled in Pakistan, over a million in Iran and many others in different countries. Faced with mounting international pressure and the loss of over 15,000 Soviet soldiers as a result of Mujahideen opposition forces trained by the United States, Pakistan, and other foreign governments, the Soviets withdrew ten years later, in 1989.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       The Soviet withdrawal was seen as an ideological victory in the United States, which had backed the Mujahideen through three U.S. presidential administrations to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the  oil -rich Persian Gulf. But when Soviet forces left, the U.S. and its allies lost interest and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country. The USSR continued to support President Najibullah until his downfall in 1992, but the absence of Soviet forces resulted in the downfall of the pro-communist government.   A leadership vacuum then appeared. Fighting continued among the Mujahideen factions, facilitating the rise of warlords. The most serious fighting occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in  Kabul . The chaos and corruption that dominated post-Soviet Afghanistan helped the rise of the Taliban, who were mostly Pashtuns from the Helmand province and Kandahar region.          Ahmed Shah Massoud was a famous military commander. He fought the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s, until he was assassinated by al-Qaeda on September 9, 2001.       The Taliban developed as a political-religious force, and seized Kabul in 1996. By the end of 2000, the Taliban were able to capture 95 percent of the country, aside from the opposition (Afghan Northern Alliance) strongholds primarily found in the northeast corner of Badakhshan Province. The Taliban sought to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic  Sharia  law and were later implicated as supporters of  terrorists , most notably by harboring Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network. During the Taliban's seven-year rule, women were banned from jobs and girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities. Those who resisted were punished instantly. Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by the cutting off a hand or foot.   Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in which the  World Trade Center  in  New York  was destroyed and the Pentagon was damaged, killing more than 3,000 people, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, a military campaign to destroy the Al-Qaeda terrorist network operating in Afghanistan and overthrow their host (the Taliban government). The U.S. made common cause with the Afghan Northern Alliance to achieve its ends.   In December 2001, major leaders from the Afghan opposition groups and diaspora met in Bonn, Germany, and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun from the southern city of Kandahar, as chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority.   After a nationwide Loya Jirga in 2002, Karzai was chosen to assume the title as interim-president of Afghanistan. In 2003, the country convened a constitutional Loya Jirga and ratified a new constitution the following year. Hamid Karzai was elected president in a nationwide election in October 2004. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assemblythe first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.   As the country continued to rebuild, by 2007 it was struggling against  poverty , poor infrastructure, large concentrations of land mines and other unexploded ordinance on earth, as well as a huge illegal opium poppy cultivation and opium trade. Afghanistan remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying and continues to grapple with the Taliban insurgency. Afghanistan also still faces the threat of attacks from a few remaining al-Qaeda, and instability, particularly in the north, caused by the remaining few semi-independent warlords.     Politics and government          Hamid Karzai became the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in 2004, following a democratic election that was held in the country for the first time in its history.       Politics in Afghanistan has consisted of power struggles, bloody coups, and unstable transfers of power. With the exception of a military junta, the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a monarchy, republic, theocracy, and communist state. The constitution ratified by the 2003 Loya Jirga restructured the government as an Islamic republic consisting of three branches: executive, legislature, and judiciary.   The president is elected directly by the Afghan people to a five-year term, and can be elected no more than twice. The president, who must be  Muslim , an Afghan citizen born of Afghan parents, and should not be guilty of war crimes, is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has two vice-presidents. President Hamid Karzai was elected in October 2004.   The National Assembly consists of two houses: the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People) and the Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders). The Wolesi Jirga, the more powerful house, consists of a maximum of 250 delegates directly elected for five years through a system of proportional representation. At least 64 delegates (two from each province) must be women. Ten Kuchi  nomads  are elected by their peers. The Wolesi Jirga makes and ratifies laws and approves the actions of the president.   The Meshrano Jirga consists of an unspecified number of local dignitaries and experts appointed by provincial councils, district councils, and the president. The president appoints two representatives of the physically disabled. The Meshrano Jirga approves all work of the lower house. The lower house has considerable veto power over senior appointments and policies.   The National Assembly of Afghanistan was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members,  communists , reformists, and Islamic fundamentalists. Twenty-eight percent of the delegates elected were women, 3 percent more than the 25 percent minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, known for its oppression of women under the Taliban, one of the leading countries in terms of female representation.   All people aged 18 and over are eligible to vote. There are five main political parties, six minor parties, and 16 other parties.   The republic's top court is the Stera Mahkama (Supreme Court). Its nine-members are appointed by the president for ten-year terms. There are also high courts, appeals courts, and local and district courts. Eligible judges can have training in either Islamic jurisprudence or secular law. A system of civil law is described, but no law may contradict the beliefs and provisions of  Islam . Courts are allowed to use Hanafi jurisprudence, one of the six branches of  Sharia law , in situations where the constitution lacks provisions. Shia jurisprudence is used in cases between Shi'ites.   There is a minister of justice, and a separate Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission established by the Bonn Agreement is charged with investigating human rights abuses and war crimes.   There are 34 provinces.   A national  police  force of 50,000 is planned. Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners.     Economy   The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, largely because of international help, the recovery of the  agricultural  sector, and service-sector growth. Real GDP growth probably exceeded 8 percent in 2006.   Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean  water ,  electricity , medical care, and  jobs .  Crime , insecurity, and the Afghan government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future growth. In 2007, two-thirds of the population lived on less than US$2 a day.   While the international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging over $24 billion at three donors' conferences since 2002, it will need to overcome a number of challenges. Expanding  poppy  cultivation and a growing opium trade generate roughly $3 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of Kabul's most serious policy concerns. As much as one-third of Afghanistan's GDP comes from opium, its two derivatives, morphine and heroin, as well as hashish production. Other challenges include budget sustainability, job creation, corruption, government capacity, and rebuilding war-torn infrastructure. Severe  drought  added to the nation's difficulties in 19982001.   The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). While there are no official unemployment rate estimates available, it is evident that it is high. The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at three million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum.   One of the main drivers for economic recovery is the return of over four million  refugees , who brought with them fresh energy,  entrepreneurship , and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start  businesses .   The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves total about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.          The plan for Kabul's $9 billion future modern urban development project, the City of Light development.       Afghanistan may possess up to 36 trillion cubic feet of  natural gas , 3.6 billion barrels of  petroleum , and up to 1.33 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. Sales of natural gas, first tapped in 1967, peaked during the 1980s at $300 million a year in export revenues (56 percent of the total). Ninety percent of these exports went to the  Soviet Union  to pay for imports and debts. When Soviet troops withdrew in 1989, Afghanistan's natural gas fields were capped to prevent  sabotage . Other reports suggest that the country has huge amounts of  gold ,  copper ,  coal , iron ore, and other rich  minerals .   The Afghan economy continues to be overwhelmingly agricultural, despite the fact that only 12 percent of its total land area is arable and less than 6 percent is cultivated. Eighty percent of the workforce is involved in agriculture that is constrained by erratic winter  snows  and spring  rains .  Irrigation  is primitive. Relatively little use is made of machines, chemical  fertilizer , or  pesticides . Current agricultural practices in Afghanistan combine cultivation and  animal husbandry .  Wheat  is the principal crop, followed by rice,  barley , and  corn . The main cash crops are  almonds  and  fruits .  Cotton  was a key export until the civil war. Large areas of land have been converted to poppy cultivation for the heroin trade.   Opium-derived revenues constituted a big source of income for both sides during the civil war. The Taliban earned roughly $4 million per year on opium taxes alone. Opium is easy to produce and transport, and Afghanistan has been the world's largest producer of opium for the past decade. In 2000, the Taliban banned opium poppy cultivation partly to attract foreign aid and, allegedly, having large stockpiles, could control the opium market and create large price increases. While cultivation of opium poppy was eliminated in Taliban-controlled areas,  drug trafficking  continued. In 2001, the Taliban allowed poppy cultivation to resume. Much of the opium production is refined into heroin. The post-Taliban Afghanistan government enacted counter-narcotics policies and programs.   Kabul International Airport is a hub to Ariana Afghan Airlines, which is the national airlines carrier of Afghanistan. A US$35 million terminal for international flight passengers, near the old terminal, was to be completed by 2008.          Kabul's public bus ( Millie Bus ) carrying passengers.       Kabul has 200 public Millie Buses. Plans are under way to re-introduce the electric buses that the city once had. Yellow taxicabs can be spotted everywhere.   Private vehicle use has increased in Kabul, with numerous Toyota, Land Rover, BMW, and Hyundai dealerships. The Toyota Corolla is prevalent. With the exception of  motorcycles  almost all vehicles in Kabul operate on diesel fuel.   Afghanistan has rapidly increased in communication technology, and has embarked on wireless companies, internet,  radio  stations, and  television  channels. Afghan telecommunication companies, Afghan Wireless, Roshan (Telecom), and Areeba, have boasted increases in rapid cellular phone use. In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a US$64.5 million dollar agreement with a company (ZTE Corporation) on the establishment of a countrywide  fiber optical cable  network.   Exports in 2005 totaled $471 million (not including illicit exports or re-exports). Export commodities included opium, fruits and  nuts , hand-woven carpets,  wool , cotton, hides and pelts, and precious and semi-precious gems. Export partners were the  United States  25.3 percent,  Pakistan  20.9 percent,  India  20.8 percent, and  Finland  4 percent. (2005)   Imports in 2005 totaled $3.87 billion. Import commodities included capital goods, food,  textiles  and petroleum products. Import partners were Pakistan 23.9 percent, United States 11.8 percent, Germany 6.8 percent, India 6.5 percent,  Turkey  5.1 percent,  Turkmenistan  5 percent,  Russia  4.7 percent, and  Kenya  4.4 percent.   With a per capita GDP of $1,310 in 2006, Afghanistan was ranked 162 out of a total of 181 nations.     Demographics   Afghanistan is an ethnically and linguistically mixed country, reflecting its location astride historic trade and invasion routes leading from Central Asia into South and Southwest Asia.     Ethnic groups   Pashtuns  are the largest ethnic group, accounting for about 42 percent of the population of 31,056,997 (a 2006 estimate). Tajiks (27 percent), Hazara (9 percent), Uzbeks (9 percent), Aimaq (4 percent), Turkmen people (3 percent), Baluch (2 percent), and other small groups (4 percent) make up the remainder. Figures are approximations because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades.            Pie chart showing Afghanistan's major ethnic groups.

The term  Afghan,  historically synonymous with  Pashtun,  is used to describe a person from the country of Afghanistan. Afghans draw their national identity from the founding of the Durrani Empire in the mid-eighteenth century. Ahmed Shah Durrani and his sons and grandsons were the first Pashtun rulers. The Pashtuns (also known as Pakhtun or Pathan) are independent people that reside mainly in southern and eastern Afghanistan and in western  Pakistan . Smaller groups are found in  Iran  and  India . Pashtun  culture  is ancient.   The Persian-speaking Tajiks are closely related to the Persians of Iran. They can trace their roots back to the original eastern Iranian peoples, such as the Bactrians, Sogdians, Scythians, and Parthians, as well as ancient Persians who fled to Central Asia during the  Arab   Islamic  expansion. The Tajiks also comprise the majority population of  Tajikistan  and are found in large numbers in Uzbekistan and Iran as well as parts of northwest  Pakistan  and the Xinjiang province of China.   The Hazara seem to have Turkic-Mongol origins, mixed with some Caucasoid. The Hazara speak Persian, with more Mongolian words, and many Afghans believe the Hazara are descendants of  Genghis Khan 's army that invaded during the twelfth century.   The Uzbeks are the main Turkic people found in Afghanistan and are found in the northern regions. The Uzbeks most likely migrated with Turkic invaders and intermingled with Iranian  tribes . Most Uzbeks are Sunni Muslim and are usually bilingual, fluent in both Persian and Uzbek.   The Turkmen people are the smaller Turkic group who can be found in neighboring  Turkmenistan . Largely Sunni Muslim, they arrived with Turkic invaders, and are traditionally  nomadic  (though they were forced to abandon this way of life in Turkmenistan itself under  Soviet  rule).   The Baluch are another Iranian ethnic group that numbers around 200,000, mostly residing in southern Afghanistan. The main Baluch areas are Baluchistan province in Pakistan and the Sistan and Baluchistan province of Iran. Likely an offshoot of the Kurds, they reached Afghanistan sometime between 1300 and 1000  B.C.E.  Mainly pastoral and desert dwellers, the Baluch are Sunni Muslim.   The Nuristani are an Indo-Iranian people, who live in the isolated northeast. Better known as the Kafirs, they were forcibly converted to  Islam  during the rule of ""Iron"" Amir Abdur Rahman and their country was renamed Nuristan. Many Nuristanis believe that they descend from  Alexander 's Greeks, but there is no genetic evidence for this. They are largely Sunni Muslims.   The median age of the Afghan population is 17.6 years, and life expectancy is 46 years.     Religion          The Blue Mosque in Mazari Sharif.       Ninety-nine percent of Afghanistan's population adheres to  Islam . An estimated 80 percent of the population is  Sunni , following the Hanafi school of jurisprudence; 19 percent is predominantly  Shi'a . Despite attempts during the years of  communist  rule to secularize Afghan society, Islamic practices pervade all aspects of life. In fact, Islam served as the principal basis for expressing opposition to communist rule and the Soviet invasion. Likewise, Islamic religious tradition and codes, together with traditional practices, provide the principal means of controlling personal conduct and settling legal disputes. Excluding urban populations, most Afghans are divided into tribal and other kinship-based groups, which follow traditional customs and religious practices.   There are about 30,000 to 150,000  Hindus  and Sikhs living in different cities, but mostly in Jalalabad, Kabul, and Kandahar. Also, there was a small  Jewish  community in Afghanistan that fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion.     Women in society   In the 1920s, King Amanullah tried to promote female empowerment, and under  communist  rule, many women were able to study in  universities . The  "

It is variously designated as geographically located within  Central Asia , [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   South Asia , [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  and the  Middle East . [ 9 ]  It is bordered by  Pakistan  in the south and east,  Iran  in the south and west,  Turkmenistan ,  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  in the north, and  China  in the far northeast. The name  Afghanistan  means the  Land of  Afghans .   Afghanistan is a crossroads between the  East  and the  West , and has been an ancient focal point of  trade  and  migration . It has an important  geostrategical  location, connecting South and Central Asia and Middle East. During its long history, the land has seen various invaders and conquerors, while on the other hand, local entities invaded the surrounding vast regions to form their own empires.  Ahmad Shah Durrani  created the  Durrani Empire  in 1747, which is considered the beginning of modern Afghanistan. [ 10 ]  Subsequently, the capital was shifted to  Kabul  and most of its territories ceded to former neighboring countries. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a  buffer state  in "" The Great Game "" played between the  British Indian Empire  and  Russian Empire . [ 11 ]  On August 19, 1919, following the  third Anglo-Afghan war , the country regained full independence from the United Kingdom over its  foreign affairs .   Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous and brutal  civil war  in addition to foreign interventions in the form of the 1979  Soviet invasion  and the recent 2001  U.S.-led invasion  that toppled the  Taliban  government. In late 2001 the  United Nations Security Council  authorized the creation of an  International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) . This force is composed of  NATO  troops that are involved in assisting the government of President  Hamid Karzai  in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key  infrastructures  in the nation. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion  US dollars  have also been provided by the international community for the  reconstruction  of the country.

Its modern usage derives from the word  Afghan .     Origin of the name   The first part of the name, ""Afghan"", is an alternative name for the  Pashtuns  who are the founders and the largest ethnic group of the country. They probably began using the term  Afghan  as a name for themselves since at least the  Islamic  period and onwards. According to W. K. Frazier Tyler, M. C. Gillet and several other scholars,  ""The word Afghan first appears in history in the  udd al-lam  in 982 AD.""   Al-Biruni  referred to Afghans as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the  Indus River , which would be the  Sulaiman Mountains . [ 12 ]   A  Moroccan  traveller,  Ibn Battuta , visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: [ 13 ]       We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of  Persians  called Afghans.       In this regard the  Encyclopdia Iranica  states: [ 14 ]       From a more limited, ethnological point of view, ""Af gh n"" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Pat-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Patn. The equation [of]  Afghan  [and]  Patn  has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Patn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically.       It further explains:       The term ""Af gh n"" has probably designated the Patn since ancient times. Under the form  Avagn , this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer  Varha Mihira  in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his  Brihat-samhita .       This information is supported by traditional  Pashto literature , for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet  Khushal Khan Khattak : [ 15 ]       Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!       The last part of the name,  -stn  is an ancient  Indo-Iranian  suffix for ""place"", prominent in many languages of the region.   The term "" Afghanistan ,"" meaning the "" Land of Afghans ,"" was mentioned by the sixteenth century  Mughal Emperor  Babur in his  memoirs , referring to the territories south of  Kabul  that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called  ""Afghans""  by Babur). [ 16 ]   Until the 19th century the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the  Kingdom of Kabul , as mentioned by the  British  statesman and historian  Mountstuart Elphinstone . [ 17 ]  Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the  Kingdom of Balkh  in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [ 18 ]   With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name ""Afghanistan"" to the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties between the  British Raj  and  Qajarid Persia , referring to the lands subject to the  Pashtun   Barakzai Dynasty  of Kabul. [ 19 ]  ""Afghanistan"" as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in 1857 by  Friedrich Engels . [ 20 ]  It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in 1919, after regaining full independence over its  foreign affairs  from the British, [ 21 ]  and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 constitution. [ 22 ]     Geography   Main article:  Geography of Afghanistan          Topography       Afghanistan is a landlocked and  mountainous  country in South- Central Asia , with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point is  Nowshak , at 7,485 m (24,557 ft) above sea level. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. The  endorheic   Sistan Basin  is one of the driest regions in the world. [ 23 ]  Afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to minor  earthquakes , mainly in the northeast of  Hindu Kush  mountain areas. Some 125 villages were damaged and 4000 people killed by the May 30, 1998 earthquake.   At 249,984 sq mi (647,500 km), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after  Myanmar ).   Tajikistan ,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  border Afghanistan to the north,  Iran  to the west,  Pakistan  to the south and the  People's Republic of China  to the east.   The country's natural resources include  gold ,  silver ,  copper ,  zinc  and  iron ore  in southeastern areas; precious and  semi-precious stones  such as  lapis ,  emerald  and  azure  in the north-east; and potentially significant  petroleum  and  natural gas  reserves in the north. The country also has  uranium ,  coal ,  chromite ,  talc ,  barites ,  sulfur ,  lead , and  salt . [ 1 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  However, these significant mineral and energy resources remain largely untapped due to the effects of the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. Plans are underway to begin extracting them in the near future. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]     History   Main article:  History of Afghanistan          For many centuries, the region that is now  Afghanistan  was the eastern part of the  Persian Empire . Ever since, it forms the eastern periphery to the  Iranian Cultural Continent .       Though the modern state of Afghanistan was founded or created in 1747 by  Ahmad Shah Durrani [ 10 ] , the land has an ancient history and various timelines of different civilizations. Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the  University of Pennsylvania , the  Smithsonian Institution  and others suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the area were among the earliest in the world. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]   Afghanistan is a country at a unique nexus point where numerous  Indo-European  civilizations have interacted and often fought, and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region has been home to various people, among them the  Aryan  ( Indo-Iranian ) tribes, such as the  Kambojas ,  Bactrians ,  Pashtuns , etc. It also has been conquered by a host of people, including the  Median  and  Persian Empires ,  Alexander the Great ,  Turks , and  Mongols . In recent times, invasions from the  British ,  Soviets , and most recently by the  United States and their allies  have taken place. On the other hand, native entities have invaded surrounding regions in  Iranian plateau ,  Central Asia  and  Indian subcontinent  to form empires of their own.   In 2000 BC,  Indo-European -speaking  Aryans  are thought to have been in the region of Afghanistan. It is unlikely [ 31 ]  that the  Aryans  themselves originated in Afghanistan although they did migrate from there south towards India and west towards  Persia , but they also migrated into Europe via north of the Caspian. These Aryans set up a nation which became known as  Airynem Vejah . Original homelands of the  Aryans  have been proposed as Anatolia, Kurdistan, Central Asia, Iran, or Northern India, with the directions of the historical migration varying accordingly. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  Later, during the rule of  Ashkanian ,  Sasanian  and after, it was called Ernshahr ( Persian :    -  rnahr ) meaning Dominion of the Aryans.   It has been speculated that  Zoroastrianism  might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BC, as  Zoroaster  lived and died in  Balkh . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]  Ancient  Eastern Iranian languages , such as  Avestan , may have been spoken in this region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the sixth century BC, the  Persian Empire  of the  Achaemenid  Persians overthrew the  Median Empire  and incorporated Afghanistan (known as  Arachosia  to the Greeks) within its boundaries.  Alexander the Great  conquered Afghanistan after 330 BCE. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the  Seleucid Empire  controlled the area until 305 BCE, when they gave most of the area to the  Mauryan Empire  as part of an alliance treaty. During Mauryan rule,  Buddhism  became the dominant religion in the region. The Mauryans were overthrown by the  Sunga Dynasty  in 185 BCE, leading to the  Hellenistic  reconquest of Afghanistan by the  Greco-Bactrians  by 180 BCE. Much of Afghanistan soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the  Indo-Greek Kingdom . The Indo-Greeks were defeated by the  Indo-Scythians  and expelled from most of Afghanistan by the end of the 2nd century BCE.          The  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom  at its maximum extent, circa 180 BCE       During the first century, the  Parthian Empire  subjugated Afghanistan, but lost it to their  Indo-Parthian  vassals. In the mid to late 1st century AD the vast  Kushan Empire , centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the  Sassanids  in the third century. Although various rulers calling themselves  Kushanshas  (generally known as  Indo-Sassanids ) continued to rule at least parts of the region, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids. [ 36 ]  The late Kushans were followed by the  Kidarite  Huns [ 37 ]  who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful  Hephthalites , as rulers of the region in the first half of the fifth century. [ 38 ]  The Hephthalites were defeated by the Sasanian king  Khosrau I  in AD 557, who re-established Sassanid power in Persia. However, the successors of Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in  Kabulistan  called  Kushano-Hephthalites  or  Kabul-Shahan / Shahi , who were later defeated by the Muslim  Arab  armies and finally conquered by Muslim Turkish armies led by the  Ghaznavids .     Islamic and Mongol conquests of the region          Afghanistan was the eastern frontier of the Islamic Caliphate by 750.       Main articles:  Islamic conquest of Afghanistan  and  Mongol invasion of Central Asia   In the  Middle Ages , up to the nineteenth century, Afghanistan was part of a larger region known as  Greater Khorasan . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  Several important centers of Khorsn are thus located in modern Afghanistan, such as  Balkh ,  Herat ,  Ghazni  and  Kabul . It was during this period of time when  Islam  was introduced and spread in the area.   The region of Afghanistan became the center of various important empires, including that of the  Samanids  (875999),  Ghaznavids  (9771187),  Seljukids  (10371194),  Ghurids  (11491212),  Mongol Empire ,  Ilkhanate  (12251335), and  Timurids  (13701506). Among them, the periods of the Ghaznavids [ 42 ]  and Timurids [ 43 ]  are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of the region's history.   In 1219 the region was overrun by the  Mongols  under  Genghis Khan , who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the  Ilkhanate  [one of 4 Subordinate Mongolian Khanates], and was extended further following the  invasion  of  Timur Lang  (Tamerlane), a ruler from Central Asia. In 1504,  Babur , a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the  Mughal Empire  with its capital at  Kabul . By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups:  Uzbeks  to the north,  Safavids  to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self-ruled by local tribes.     Hotaki dynasty   Main article:  Hotaki dynasty   In 1709,  Mir Wais Hotak , a local Afghan ( Pashtun ) from the  Ghilzai  clan, overthrew and killed  Gurgin Khan , the Safavid governor of  Kandahar . Mir Wais successfully defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the local population of Kandahar from  Sunni  to the  Shia  sect of  Islam . Mir Wais held the region of Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son  Mir Mahmud Hotaki . In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an Afghan army to  Isfahan  ( Iran ), sacked the city and proclaimed himself  King of Persia . However, the great majority still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan by the Afghans  including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family  the  Hotaki dynasty  was eventually removed from power by a new ruler,  Nadir Shah  of Persia. [ 44 ] [ 45 ]          Conquest of the Afghan Durrani Empire at its greatest extent         Durrani Empire: beginnings of the Afghan state   Main article:  Durrani Empire   In 1738 Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns of the  Abdali  clan [ 46 ] , conquered the region of Kandahar; in the same year he occupied Ghazni, Kabul and  Lahore . On June 19, 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated, possibly planned by his nephew  Ali Qoli . In the same year, one of Nadir's military commanders and personal bodyguard,  Ahmad Shah Abdali , a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a  loya jirga  following Nadir's death. The Afghans gathered at  Kandahar  and chose Ahmad Shah as their King. Since then, he is often regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. [ 1 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  After the inauguration, he changed his title or clans' name to  Durrani , which derives from the Persian word  Durr , meaning  Pearl . [ 46 ]   By 1751 Ahmad Shah Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with  Delhi  in India. [ 20 ]  In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired to his home in  Maruf , Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He was succeeded by his son,  Timur Shah Durrani , who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was finally succeeded by his son  Zaman Shah Durrani .     European influence and the creation of the state of Afghanistan   Main article:  European influence in Afghanistan          King Amanullah on a royal trip to Berlin. This trip initiated a great alliance between Afghanistan and Germany that continues to this day.       During the nineteenth century, following the  Anglo-Afghan wars  (fought 183942, 187880, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the  Barakzai dynasty , Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the United Kingdom. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King  Amanullah Khan  acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its foreign affairs (see  The Great Game ). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the  Durand Line . This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India  and later the new state of Pakistan  over what came to be known as the  Pashtunistan  debate.     The Kingdom of Afghanistan   King  Amanullah  (1919-1929) moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the Third Anglo-Afghan war. He established diplomatic relations with most major countries and, following a 1927 tour of  Europe  and  Turkey  (during which he noted the modernization and secularization advanced by  Atatrk ), introduced several reforms intended to modernize Afghanistan. A key force behind these reforms was  Mahmud Tarzi ,  Amanullah Khan 's Foreign Minister and father-in-law - and an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a  Loya Jirga ), which made elementary education compulsory. [ 49 ]  Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional  Muslim   veil  for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after  Kabul  fell to forces led by  Habibullah Kalakani .          Afghan King Zahir Shah and his wife with then-US  President John F. Kennedy  and Caroline Kennedy       .   Prince Mohammed Nadir Khan, a cousin of Amanullah's, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October of the same year, and with considerable Pashtun tribal support he was declared King Nadir Shah. He began consolidating power and regenerating the country. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favour of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a Kabul student.   Mohammad Zahir Shah, Nadir Khan's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was when the country was under the rule of  King Zahir Shah . Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. In 1946, another of Zahir Shah's uncles,  Sardar Shah Mahmud Khan , became Prime Minister and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced as Prime Minister by  Mohammed Daoud Khan , the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the  Soviet Union  and a more distant one towards  Pakistan .     Republic of Afghanistan   Main article:  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan   However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law,  Mohammed Daoud Khan , launched a bloodless coup and became the first  President of Afghanistan  while Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit. Mohammed Daoud Khan jammed Afghan radio's with anti-Pakistani broadcasts and looked to the Soviet Union and the United States for aid for development.   In 1978 a prominent member of the  People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  (PDPA), Mir Akbar Khyber (or Kaibar), was killed by the government. The leaders of PDPA apparently feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all, especially since most of them were arrested by the government shortly after.  Hafizullah Amin  and a number of military wing officers of the PDPA managed to remain at large and organised an uprising.   The PDPA, led by  Nur Mohammad Taraki ,  Babrak Karmal  and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed along with his family. The uprising was known as the  Great Saur Revolution  ('Saur' means 'April' in Pashto). On May 1, Taraki became  President ,  Prime Minister  and  General Secretary  of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the  Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  (DRA), and the PDPA regime lasted, in some form or another, until April 1992.   Some are of the opinion that the 1978  Khalq  uprising against the government of Daoud Khan was essentially a resurgence by the  Ghilzai  tribe of the  Pashtun  against the  Durrani  (the tribe of Daoud Khan and the previous monarchy). [ 50 ]          Kabul's Queens Palace before the Soviet invasion, as the headquarters of the PDPA.       Once in power, the PDPA moved to permit  freedom of religion  and carried out an ambitious  land reform , waiving farmers' debts countrywide. They also made a number of statements on  womens rights  and introduced women to political life. A prominent example was Anahita Ratebzad, who was a major Marxist leader and a member of the Revolutionary Council. Ratebzad wrote the famous May 28, 1978  New Kabul Times  editorial which declared: Privileges which women, by right, must have are equal education, job security, health services, and free time to rear a healthy generation for building the future of the country  Educating and enlightening women is now the subject of close government attention. [ 51 ]   Many people in the cities including Kabul either welcomed or were ambivalent to these policies. However, the  secular  nature of the government made it unpopular with religiously conservative Afghans in the villages and the countryside, who favoured traditionalist 'Islamic' law.   The U.S. saw the situation as a prime opportunity to weaken the  Soviet Union . As part of a  Cold War  strategy, in 1979 the  United States government  (under President  Jimmy Carter ) began to covertly fund forces ranged against the pro-Soviet government, although warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention, (according to National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brzezinski ). [ 52 ]  The  Mujahideen  belonged to various different factions, but all shared, to varying degrees, a similarly conservative 'Islamic' ideology.   In March 1979 Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of  field marshal  and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army. On September 14, Amin overthrew Taraki, who died or was killed.     Soviet invasion and civil war   Main articles:  Soviet war in Afghanistan  and  Civil war in Afghanistan   In order to bolster the  Parcham  faction, the Soviet Unionciting the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countriesintervened on December 24, 1979. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100,000 plus and by members of the Parcham faction. Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal.          Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.       In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and part of its overall  Cold War  strategy, the  United States  responded by arming and otherwise supporting the Afghan  mujahideen , which had taken up arms against the Soviet occupiers. U.S. support began during the  Carter  administration, but increased substantially during the  Reagan administration , in which it became a centerpiece of the so-called  Reagan Doctrine  under which the U.S. provided support to anti-communist resistance movements in Afghanistan and also in  Angola ,  Nicaragua , and other nations. In addition to U.S. support, the mujahideen received support from  Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and other nations.   The Soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians. Over five million  Afghans  fled their country to Pakistan, Iran and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989.    The Soviet withdrawal from the DRA was seen as an ideological victory in the U.S., which had backed the Mujahideen through three U.S. presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich  Persian Gulf .   Following the removal of the Soviet forces, the U.S. and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. [ citation needed ]  The  USSR  continued to support President  Najibullah  (former head of the Afghan secret service,  KHAD ) until 1992 when the new Russian government refused to sell oil products to the Najibullah regime. [ 53 ]   Because of the fighting, a number of elites and intellectuals fled to take refuge abroad. This led to a leadership imbalance in Afghanistan. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, which gave rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. It was at this time that the  Taliban  developed as a politico-religious force, eventually seizing Kabul in 1996 and establishing the  Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . By the end of 2000 the Taliban had captured 95% of the country.   During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. [ 54 ]  Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. [ 55 ]  The majority of the opium production was eradicated by 2001. [ 56 ]     2001present war in Afghanistan   Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001present)          Map of Afghanistan by the United Nations showing regional security risks and levels of  opium poppy cultivation .              Current President Hamid Karzai reviewing the Presidential Guard in Kabul.       Following the  September 11 attacks  the United States launched  Operation Enduring Freedom , a military campaign to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The U.S. military also threatened to overthrow the Taliban government for refusing to hand over  Osama bin Laden  and several al-Qaida members. The U.S. made a common cause with the former Afghan Mujahideen to achieve its ends, including the  Northern Alliance , a militia still recognized by the  UN  as the Afghan government.   In late 2001, the United States sent teams of CIA Paramilitary Officers from their  Special Activities Division  and U.S. Army Special Forces to invade Afghanistan to aid anti-Taliban militias, backed by U.S. air strikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda targets, culminating in the seizure of Kabul by the Northern Alliance and the overthrow of the Taliban, with many local warlords switching allegiance from the Taliban to the Northern Alliance. [ 57 ]   In December of the same year, leaders of the former Afghan mujahideen and diaspora met in Germany, and agreed on a  plan  for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of  Hamid Karzai , an ethnic Pashtun of the Durrani clan (from which the royal family was drawn) from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the  Afghan Interim Authority .   After a nationwide  Loya Jirga  in 2002, Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim President of Afghanistan. The country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) in 2003 and a new  constitution  was ratified in January 2004. Following an election in October 2004, Hamid Karzai won and became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly  the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973  sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.   As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor  infrastructure , large concentration of  land mines  and other unexploded ordnance, as well as a huge illegal  poppy  cultivation and  opium  trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the  Taliban insurgency  and the threat of attacks from a few remaining al Qaeda.   At the start of 2007 reports of the Taliban's increasing presence in Afghanistan led the U.S. to consider longer tours of duty and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007, U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions. Also, The number of insurgent attacks is up 300 percent since September, 2006, when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters.   See also:  Timeline of the history of Afghanistan  and  Invasions of Afghanistan     Government and politics   Main article:  Politics of Afghanistan   Politics in Afghanistan has historically consisted of power struggles, bloody  coups  and unstable transfers of power. With the exception of a  military junta , the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a  monarchy ,  republic ,  theocracy  and  communist state . The constitution ratified by the  2003 Loya jirga  restructured the government as an  Islamic republic  consisting of three branches, ( executive ,  legislature  and  judiciary ).   Afghanistan is currently led by President  Hamid Karzai , who was elected in October 2004. The current  parliament  was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members, communists,  reformists , and  Islamic fundamentalists . 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3 points more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, long known under the Taliban for its  oppression of women , one of the leading countries in terms of female representation. Construction for a new parliament building began on August 29, 2005.   The  Supreme Court of Afghanistan  is currently led by Chief Justice  Abdul Salam Azimi , a former university professor who had been legal advisor to the president. [ 58 ]  The previous court, appointed during the time of the interim government, had been dominated by fundamentalist religious figures, including Chief Justice  Faisal Ahmad Shinwari . The court issued several rulings, such as banning  cable television , seeking to ban a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and limiting the rights of women, as well as overstepping its constitutional authority by issuing rulings on subjects not yet brought before the court. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more  technocrats  than the previous court, although it has yet to issue any rulings.   See also:  Constitution of Afghanistan     Law enforcement and military          An Afghan Air Force soldier aboard an Afghan gunship.       Main articles:  Law enforcement in Afghanistan  and  Military of Afghanistan   Afghanistan currently has more than 70,000  national police  officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 80,000. They are being trained by and through the  Afghanistan Police Program . Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, sometimes local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners. In 2003 the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, now under command of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) was extended and expanded beyond the  Kabul  area. However, in some areas unoccupied by those forces, local militias maintain control. In many areas, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police and/or communications. Troops of the  Afghan National Army  have been sent to quell fighting in some regions lacking police protection. [ 59 ]   The  Afghan National Army  currently has 80,000 troops, with plans to nearly double in the next few years. The Afghan Army is not affected by corruption as the National Police due to international oversight.     Administrative divisions   Main articles:  Provinces of Afghanistan  and  Districts of Afghanistan   Afghanistan is administratively divided into thirty-four (34)  provinces  ( welayats ), and for each province there is a capital. Each province is then divided into many provincial  districts , and each district normally covers a city or several  townships .   The  Governor  of the province is appointed by the  Ministry of Interior , and the  Prefects  for the districts of the province will be appointed by the provincial Governor. The Governor is the representative of the central government of Afghanistan, and is responsible for all administrative and formal issues. The provincial  Chief of Police  is appointed by the Ministry of Interior, who works together with the Governor on law enforcement for all the cities or districts of that province.   There is an exception in the capital city (Kabul) where the  Mayor  is selected by the  President of Afghanistan , and is completely independent from the  prefecture  of the  Kabul Province .

Therefore, relations between Afghanistan and NATO members is strong. Afghanistan depends a lot on multi-billion dollar aid infusions from the United States. Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany are also large donors.   Relations between Afghanistan and the  Islamic Republic of Iran  are very strong. The two nations share the same language and culture, and both countries are part of  Greater Persia . Shiites and Sunnis get a long well in Afghanistan which causes no religious tensions between the two nations. Iran is a consistent donor towards Afghan reconstruction.   Afghan and Pakistani relations always fluctuate. The two nations are always disputing, but recent relations have deteriorated vastly. Afghan Intelligence and American agencies accuse Pakistan of working to stop Afghan reconstruction mainly through the  Inter-Services Intelligence . Most of the Taliban come from Pakistan and Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Pakistan. Afghanistan and Pakistan recently fought a series of border skirmishes and the US has lead several air strikes in Pakistani territory from Afghan air bases.   Afghanistan maintains excellent relations with their Northern Allies, including  Uzbekistan ,  Tajikistan  and  Turkmenistan  as all three share a similar culture as the Afghans.  Hazaras  are from those nations.   Afghanistan also has good relations with Russia and India. India is a leading investor in Afghanistan, alongside Iran, and the current Afghan President, Hamid Karzai received some of his college education in India.   Afghanistan has excellent relations with the rest of the Arab and  Muslim world . Afghanistan has no relations with Israel and alongside ally Iran, is a frequent non-Arab critic of Israel.     Demographics   Main article:  Demography of Afghanistan   Further information:  Refugees of Afghanistan   A July 2008 estimate of the total Afghan population is 32,738,376. [ 60 ]     Largest cities   See also:  List of cities in Afghanistan  and  Places in Afghanistan   The only city in Afghanistan with over one million residents is its capital, Kabul. The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size,  Kandahar ,  Herat ,  Mazar-e Sharif ,  Jalalabad ,  Ghazni  and  Kunduz .     Ethnic groups   The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the country in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are not available. [ 61 ]  Therefore most figures are approximations only:           Ethnic groups of Afghanistan )        36.4% to 42.0%  Pashtun         27% to 38.0%  Tajik         8.0% to 10.0%  Hazara         6.0% to 9.2%  Uzbek          0.1% to 4%  Aimak         1.7 to 3%  Turkmen         0.5% to 4%  Baloch          1.9% to 9.2% other ( Pashai ,  Hindki ,  Nuristani ,  Brahui ,  Hindkowans , etc.)               Languages of Afghanistan   (percentages are from  CIA World Factbook ) [ 1 ]         50%  Dari (Eastern Persian)         35%  Pashto         8%  Uzbek         3%  Turkmen         4%  Balochi         2% other ( Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui , etc.)             (1) Based on official census numbers from the 1960s to the 1980s, as well as information found in mainly scholarly sources, the  Encyclopdia Iranica [ 62 ]  gives the following list:     39.4% Pashtun   33.7% Tajik,  Farsiwan , and  Qezelbash   8.0% Hazara   8.0% Uzbek   4.1% Aimak   3.3% Turkmen   1.6% Baloch   1.9% other           (2) An approximate distribution of ethnic groups based on the  CIA World Factbook [ 1 ]  is as following:     Pashtun: 42%   Tajik: 27%   Hazara: 9%   Uzbek: 9%   Aimak: 4%   Turkmen: 3%   Baloch : 2%   Other: 4%                             (3) According to a representative survey, named  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , a combined project of  The Asia Foundation , the  Indian   Centre for the Study of Developing Societies  (CSDS) and the  Afghan Center for Socio-economic and Opinion Research  (ACSOR), the distribution of the ethnic groups is: [ 63 ]     40.9% Pashtun   37.1% Tajik   9.2% Hazara   9.2% Uzbek   1.7% Turkmen   0.5% Baloch   0.1% Aimak   1.3% other           (4) According to another representative survey, named  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand"" , a combined effort by the American broadcasting channel  ABC News , the British  BBC , and the German  ARD  (from the years 2004 to 2009), and released on February 9th 2009, the ethnic composition of the country is (avarege numbers): [ 64 ]     41% Pashtun   38% Tajik   10% Hazara   6% Uzbek   2% Turkmen   1% Nuristani   1% Baloch   1% other                         Languages   Main articles:  Languages of Afghanistan ,  Persian language , and  Pashto language   The most common languages spoken in Afghanistan are  Eastern Persian  (also known as Dari; roughly 50%) and Pashto (roughly 35%). Both are  Indo-European languages  from the  Iranian languages  sub-family, and the  official languages  of the country.  Hazaragi , spoken by the Hazara minority, is a distinct dialect of Persian. Other languages spoken include the  Turkic languages   Uzbek  and  Turkmen  (ca. 9% combined), as well as 30 minor languages, primarily  Balochi ,  Nuristani ,  Pashai ,  Brahui ,  Pamiri languages ,  Hindko , etc. (ca. 4% combined).  Bilingualism  is common.   According to the Encyclopdia Iranica, [ 65 ]  the Persian language is the most widely used language of the country, spoken by around 80% of the population, while Pashto is spoken and understood by around 50% of the population. According to  ""A survey of the Afghan people - Afghanistan in 2006"" , [ 63 ]  Persian is the first language of 49% of the population, while additional 37% speak the language as a second language (combined 86%). Pashto is the first language of 40% of the population, while additional 27% know the language (combined 67%). Uzbek is spoken or understood by 6% of the population, Turkmen by 3%. According to the survey  ""Afghanistan: Where Things Stand""  (avarege numbers from 2005-2009), 69% of the interviewed people preferred Persian, while 31% spoke Pashto. [ 64 ]     Culture   Main article:  Culture of Afghanistan   Afghans display pride in their religion, country, ancestry, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their  clan  loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes. [ 66 ]  As clan warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.   Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous statues of Buddha in the Bamyan Province were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as  idolatrous . Other famous sites include the cities of  Kandahar , Heart, Ghazni and Balkh. The Minaret of Jam, in the  Hari River  valley, is a  UNESCO World Heritage site . The cloak worn by  Muhammad  is stored inside the famous Khalka Sharifa in Kandahar City.   Buzkashi  is a national sport in Afghanistan. It is similar to  polo  and played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a  goat  carcass.  Afghan hounds  (a type of running  dog ) also originated in Afghanistan.   Although literacy levels are very low, classic  Persian poetry  plays a very important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in  Iran  and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Persian culture has, and continues to, exert a great influence over Afghan culture. Private poetry competition events known as mushaera are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every homeowner owns one or more poetry collections of some sort, even if they are not read often.   The eastern dialects of the Persian language are popularly known as ""Dari"". The name itself derives from ""Prs-e Darbr"", meaning  Persian of the royal courts . The ancient term  Dar   one of the original names of the Persian language  was revived in the Afghan constitution of 1964, and was intended ""to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language. Hence, the name  Frs , the language of  Frs , is strictly avoided."" [ 67 ]          Girls in Kabul, wearing their traditional clothes, sing at a celebration of International Women's Day       in 2002.]]   Many of the famous  Persian poets  of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from Khorasan where is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy.     Mawln Rumi , who was born and educated in Balkh in the thirteenth century and moved to  Konya  in modern-day  Turkey   Rabi'a Balkhi  (the first poetess in the History of Persian Poetry, tenth century, native of Balkh)   Daqiqi Balkhi  (tenth century, native of Balkh)   Farrukhi Sistani  (tenth century, the  Ghaznavids  royal poet)   Unsuri Balkhi  (a tenth/eleventh century poet, native of Balkh)   Khwaja Abdullah Ansari  (eleventh century, from Herat)   Nasir Khusraw  (eleventh century, from Qubadyan near Balkh)   Anvari  (twelfth century, lived and died in Balkh)   San' Ghaznawi  (twelfth century, native of Ghazni)   Jm of Hert  (fifteenth century, native of Herat in western Afghanistan), and his nephew Abdullah Hatifi Herawi, a well-known poet   Al Sher Nav'  (fifteenth century, Herat).     Most of these individuals were of Persian ( Tjk ) ethnicity who still form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-known in Persian-speaking world, include  Khalilullah Khalili , [ 68 ]  Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari, [ 69 ]  Sarwar Joya,  Parwin Pazwak  and others. In 2003, Khaled Hosseini published The  Kite Runner  which though fiction, captured much of the history, politics and culture experienced in Afghanistan from the 1930s to present day.   In addition to poets and authors, numerous  Persian scientists  were born or worked in the region of present-day Afghanistan. Most notable was  Avicenna  (Abu Al Hussein ibn Sn) whose father hailed from Balkh. Ibn Sn, who travelled to  Isfahan  later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as ""the father of modern medicine"". George Sarton called ibn Sn ""the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times."" His most famous works are  The Book of Healing  and  The Canon of Medicine , also known as the Qanun. Ibn Sn's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through  Noah Gordon 's  The Physician , now published in many languages. Moreover, according to  Ibn al-Nadim ,  Al-Farabi , a well-known philosopher and scientist, was from the Faryab Province of Afghanistan.   Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the  Nauroz -celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the twentieth century has been likened to  Vienna  during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.   The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is potent in political terms. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, they would assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders. In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call.   Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. [ 66 ]     Religions   Main article:  Religion in Afghanistan   Religiously, Afghans are over 99%  Muslims : approximately 74-80%  Sunni  and 19-25%  Shi'a [ 1 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  (estimates vary). Up until the mid-1980s, there were about 30,000 to 150,000  Hindus  and  Sikhs  living in different cities, mostly in  Jalalabad ,  Kabul , and  Kandahar . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]   There was a small  Jewish  community in Afghanistan ( see  Bukharan Jews ) who fled the country after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and only one individual,  Zablon Simintov , remains today. [ 74 ]     Economy   Main article:  Economy of Afghanistan   Afghanistan is a member of the  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ,  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  and the  Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) . It is an impoverished country, one of the world's poorest and least developed. Two-thirds of the population lives on fewer than 2  US  dollars a day. Its economy has suffered greatly from the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 19982001. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]   The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). As of 2005, the official unemployment rate is at 40%. [ 77 ]  The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum. [ 78 ]   The nation's economy began to improve since 2002 due to the infusion of multi-billion  US dollars  in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats. [ 79 ]  It is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought in most of the country.   The real value of  non-drug  GDP increased by 29% in 2002, 16% in 2003, 8% in 2004 and 14% in 2005. [ 80 ]  As much as one-third of Afghanistan's  GDP  comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including  opium  and its two derivatives,  morphine  and  heroin , as well as  hashish  production. [ 1 ]   Opium production in Afghanistan  has soared to a new record in 2007, with an increase on last year of more than a third, the United Nations has said. [ 81 ]  Some 3.3 million Afghans are now involved in producing opium. [ 82 ]  In a recent article in the  Washington Quarterly , Peter van Ham and Jorrit Kamminga argue that the international community should establish a pilot project and investigate a licensing scheme to start the production of medicines such as morphine and codeine from poppy crops to help it escape the economic dependence on opium: [ 83 ]   According to a 2004 report by the  Asian Development Bank , the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development. [ 78 ]  In 2006, two U.S. companies, Black & Veatch and the  Louis Berger Group , have won a US 1.4 billion dollar contract to rebuild roads, power lines and water supply systems of Afghanistan. [ 84 ]   One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 4 million refugees from neighbouring countries and the  West , who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. What is also helping is the estimated US 23 billion dollars in international assistance every year, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. Private developments are also beginning to get underway. In 2006, a Dubai-based Afghan family opened a $25 million  Coca Cola  bottling plant in Afghanistan. [ 85 ]   While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion  about 15%  is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the  United Nations  system and  non-governmental organizations . The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.   Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the Afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old Afghani by 1 new Afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003. [ 78 ]   The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels. Since 2003, over sixteen new banks have opened in the country, including  Afghanistan International Bank ,  Kabul Bank ,  Azizi Bank ,  Standard Chartered Bank ,  First Micro Finance Bank , and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year  tax holidays  to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports  tariffs  and duties.   Some private investment projects, backed with national support, are also beginning to pick up steam in Afghanistan. An initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr.  Hisham N. Ashkouri , Principal of ARCADD, Inc. for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue, [ 86 ]  revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the  Afghan National Museum .   According to the U.S. Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to 36 trillion cubic feet (1,000 km 3 ) of  natural gas , 3.6 billion barrels (570,000,000 m 3 ) of  petroleum  and up to 1,325 million barrels (2.107E+8 m 3 ) of  natural gas liquids . This could mark the turning point in Afghanistans reconstruction efforts. Energy exports could generate the revenue that Afghan officials need to modernize the countrys infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for the beleaguered and fractious population. [ 27 ]  Other reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal,  iron ore  and other  minerals . [ 24 ] [ 28 ] [ 87 ]  The government of Afghanistan is in the process of extracting and exporting its copper reserves, which will be earning $1.2 billion US dollars in  royalties  and taxes every year for the next 30 years. It will also provide permanent labor to 3,000 of its citizens.

International flights include to  Dubai ,  Frankfurt ,  Istanbul  and a number of other destinations. [ citation needed ]  There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from  Kam Air ,  Pamir Airways  and Safi Airlines.   The country has limited rail service with Turkmenistan. There are two  railway  projects currently in progress, one is between Herat and the Iranian city  Mashad  while another is between Kandahar and  Quetta  in Pakistan. Most people who travel from one city to another use bus services. Automobiles have recently become more widely available, with  Toyota ,  Nissan  and  Hyundai  dealerships in Kabul. A large number of second-hand vehicles are also arriving from the  UAE . Nearly all highways and roads are being rebuilt in the country.     Communications and technology   Main article:  Communications in Afghanistan   Telecommunication services in the country are provided by  Afghan Wireless ,  Etisalat ,  Roshan ,  Areeba  and  Afghan Telecom . In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a  US$ 64.5 million agreement with  ZTE Corporation  for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optic cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country. [ 89 ]  Around 500,000 (1.5% of the population) had internet access by the end of 2008. [ 90 ]   Television and radio broadcastings are available in most parts of the country, with local and international channels or stations.   The nation's post service is also operating. Package delivery services such as  FedEx ,  DHL  and others are also available.     Media   Main article:  Media of Afghanistan   The media was tightly controlled under the  Taliban  and other periods in its history, and was relatively free in others. Under the Taliban, television was shut down in 1996, and print media were forbidden to publish commentary, photos or readers letters. [ 91 ]  The only radio station broadcast religious programmes and  propaganda , and aired no music. [ 91 ]   After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified.  Freedom of expression  and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and  censorship  is banned, though  defaming  individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of  Islam  is prohibited. In 2008,  Reporters Without Borders  listed the media environment as 156 out of 173, with 1st being most free. [ 92 ]  400 publications are now registered and 60 radio stations, a major source of information, currently exist. [ 93 ]  Foreign radio stations, such as the  BBC World Service , also broadcast into the country. However,  press freedom  is threatened by the continuing  war in Afghanistan , with kidnappings of journalists, harassment and death threats.     Education   Main article:  Education in Afghanistan   As of 2006 more than four million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout the country. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. A lack of women teachers is an issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men. [ 94 ]   Literacy of the entire population is estimated (as of 1999) at 36%, the male literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. Up to now there are 9,500 schools in the country.   Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of  higher education . Following the fall of the Taliban,  Kabul University  was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the  American University of Afghanistan  also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The university accepts students from Afghanistan and the neighboring countries. Construction work will soon start at the new site selected for  University of Balkh  in Mazari Sharif. The new building for the university, including the building for the Engineering Department, would be constructed at  600 acres (2.4 km)  of land at the cost of 250 million US dollars. [ 95 ]   A new military school is in function to properly train and educate Afghan soldiers.

The economy was shackled by  extensive regulation ,  protectionism , and public ownership, leading to  pervasive corruption  and  slow growth . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  Since 1991,  continuing economic liberalization  has moved the economy towards a  market-based system . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   Agriculture  is the predominant occupation in India, accounting for 60% of employment.  Service sector  makes up 28% and  industrial sector  12%. [ 8 ]  One estimate is that only one in five job-seekers has had any sort of  vocational training . [ 9 ]  The labor force totals  half billion people . In terms of output, the agricultural sector accounts for 28% of GDP; the service and industrial sectors make up 54% and 18% respectively. Major agricultural products include  rice ,  wheat ,  oilseed ,  cotton ,  jute ,  tea ,  sugarcane ,  potatoes ;  cattle ,  water buffalo ,  sheep ,  goats ,  poultry ;  fish .. [ 10 ]  Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, software. [ 10 ]  India's GDP is US$1.089 trillion, which makes it the  twelfth-largest  economy in the world [ 11 ]  or  fourth largest  by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates. India's nominal  per capita income  US$977 is ranked  128th  in the world. In the late 2000s, India's  economic growth  has averaged 7% a year, which will double the average income in a decade. [ 5 ]   Previously a closed economy, India's trade has grown fast. [ 5 ] India currently accounts for 1.5% of World trade as of 2007 according to the WTO. According to the World Trade Statistics of the WTO in 2006, India's total merchandise trade (export + import) was valued at 294 billion dollars in 2006 and India's services trade inclusive of export and import was 143 billion dollars. Thus, India's global economic engagement in 2006 covering both merchandise and services trade was of the order of 437 billion dollars, up by a record 72 percent from a level of 253 billion dollars in 2004. [ 12 ]  India's trade has reached a still relatively moderate share 24% of GDP in 2006, up from 6% in 1985. [ 5 ]   India remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Although the Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades; its growth has been uneven when comparing different social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas. Unemployment rate is 7.2% (2007 estimate). [ 13 ]   [ 14 ] The percentage of people living below the new  international poverty line  $1.25 a day (PPP, in nominal terms Rs 21.6 a day in urban areas and Rs 14.3 in rural areas in 2005) decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. [ 15 ] . 85.7% of the population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) a day in 2005, compared with 80.5% for  Sub-Saharan Africa . [ 16 ]  Even though the arrival of  Green Revolution  brought end to  famines in India [ 17 ] , half of children are  underweight , one of the highest rates in the world and nearly double the rate of Sub-Saharan Africa.

The advent of British colonisation started the colonial period in the 17th century, which ended with  independence  in 1947. The third period stretches from independence in 1947 until now.     [ edit ]   Pre-colonial   The citizens of the  Indus Valley civilisation , a permanent and predominantly urban settlement that flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well planned streets, a drainage system and water supply reveals their knowledge of  urban planning , which included the world's first urban  sanitation  systems and the existence of a form of  municipal government . [ 19 ]          Silver coin minted during the reign of the  Gupta  king  Kumara Gupta I  (AD 41455)       The 1872 census revealed that 99.3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages, [ 20 ]  whose economies were largely isolated and self-sustaining, with agriculture the predominant occupation. This satisfied the food requirements of the village and provided raw materials for hand-based industries, such as  textiles ,  food processing  and  crafts . Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins,  barter  was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while its craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services. [ 21 ]   Religion, especially  Hinduism , and the  caste  and the  joint family  systems, played an influential role in shaping economic activities. [ 22 ]  The caste system functioned much like medieval European  guilds , ensuring the  division of labour , providing for the training of apprentices and, in some cases, allowing manufacturers to achieve narrow specialization. For instance, in certain regions, producing each variety of cloth was the speciality of a particular sub-caste.          Estimates of the per capita income of India (18571900) as per 194849 prices. [ 23 ]       Textiles such as  muslin ,  Calicos ,  shawls , and agricultural products such as  pepper ,  cinnamon ,  opium  and  indigo  were exported to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia in return for gold and silver. [ 24 ]   Assessment of India's pre-colonial economy is mostly qualitative, owing to the lack of quantitative information. One estimate puts the revenue of  Akbar 's  Mughal Empire  in 1600 at   17.5 million, in contrast with the total revenue of Great Britain in 1800, which totalled 16 million. [ 25 ]  India, by the time of the arrival of the British, was a largely traditional agrarian economy with a dominant subsistence sector dependent on primitive technology. It existed alongside a competitively developed network of commerce, manufacturing and credit. After the fall of the  Mughals , India was administered by  Maratha Empire . The Maratha Empire's budget in 1740s, at its peak, was Rs. 100 million. After the loss at Panipat, the Maratha Empire disintegrated into confederate states of Gwalior, Baroda, Indore, Jhansi, Nagpur, Pune and Kolhapur. Gwalior state had a budget of Rs. 30M. However, at this time, British East India company entered the Indian political theatre. Until 1857, when India was firmly under the British crown, the country remained in a state of political instability due to internecine wars and conflicts. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Colonial          An aerial view of Calcutta Port taken in 1945.  Calcutta , which was the economic hub of British India, saw increased industrial activity during  World War II .       Company rule in India  brought a major change in the taxation environment from revenue taxes to property taxes resulting in mass impoverishment and destitution of the great majority of farmers, resulting in numerous famines. [ 27 ]  The economic policies of the  British Raj  effectively destroyed India's large handicrafts industry and caused a massive drain of India's resources. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  An estimate by  Cambridge University  historian Angus Maddison reveals that India's share of the world income fell from 22.6% in 1700, comparable to Europe's share of 23.3%, to a low of 3.8% in 1952. [ 30 ]  It also created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed  property rights  among the colonizers, encouraged  free trade , and created a single currency with  fixed exchange rates , standardized weights and measures,  capital markets , a well developed system of  railways  and  telegraphs , a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference, and a common-law, adversarial legal system. [ 31 ]  India's colonisation by the British coincided with major changes in the world economyindustrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world, [ 32 ]  with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, one of the world's lowest  life expectancies , and low rates of  literacy .   The impact of the British rule on India's economy is a controversial topic. While leaders of the  Indian independence movement , and left-nationalist  economic historians  have blamed colonial rule for the dismal state of India's economy in its aftermath, right-wing historians have countered that India's economic performance was due to various sectors being in a state of growth and decline, resulting from changes brought about by colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialization and  economic integration . [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Independence to 1991   Indian  economic policy  after  independence  was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders' exposure to  Fabian socialism . Policy tended towards  protectionism , with a strong emphasis on  import substitution ,  industrialization ,  state intervention  in labor and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and  central planning . [ 34 ]   Five-Year Plans of India  resembled central planning in the  Soviet Union . Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalized in the mid-1950s. [ 35 ]  Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying  red tape , commonly referred to as  Licence Raj , were required to set up business in  India  between 1947 and 1990. [ 36 ]   Jawaharlal Nehru , the first  prime minister , along with the statistician  Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis , carried on by  Indira Gandhi  formulated and oversaw economic policy. They expected favorable outcomes from this strategy, because it involved both public and private sectors and was based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme  Soviet-style  central command system. [ 37 ]  The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive  heavy industry  and subsidizing manual, low-skill  cottage industries  was criticized by economist  Milton Friedman , who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers. [ 38 ]   India's low average growth rate from 194780 was derisively referred to as the  Hindu rate of growth , because of the unfavourable comparison with growth rates in other Asian countries, especially the  ""East Asian Tigers"" . [ 31 ]   The  Rockefeller Foundation 's research in  high-yielding varieties of seeds , their introduction after 1965 and the increased use of  fertilizers  and  irrigation  are known collectively as the  Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self-sufficient in food grains, thus improving  agriculture in India .  Famine in India , once accepted as inevitable, has not returned since the introduction of Green Revolution crops.     [ edit ]   After 1991       Main article:  Economic liberalization in India              Major improvements in educational standards across India has helped its economic rise. Shown here is the  Indian School of Business  at  Hyderabad , ranked number 20 in global MBA rankings by the  Financial Times  of London in 2008 [ 39 ]       In the late 80s, the government led by  Rajiv Gandhi  eased restrictions on capacity expansion for incumbents, removed price controls and reduced corporate taxes. While this increased the rate of growth, it also led to high fiscal deficits and a worsening current account. The collapse of the  Soviet Union , which was India's major trading partner, and the  first Gulf War , which caused a spike in oil prices, caused a major balance-of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of defaulting on its loans. [ 40 ]  India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from  IMF , which in return demanded reforms. [ 41 ]   In response, Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao  along with his finance minister  Manmohan Singh  initiated the  economic liberalisation of 1991 . The reforms did away with the  Licence Raj  (investment, industrial and import licensing) and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of  foreign direct investment  in many sectors. [ 42 ]  Since then, the overall direction of liberalisation has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the  trade unions  and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. [ 43 ]  Since 1990 India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the developing world; during this period, the economy has grown constantly, but with a few major setbacks. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security.   While the credit rating of India was hit by its nuclear tests in 1998, it has been raised to investment level in 2007 by S&P and Moody's. [ 44 ]  In 2003,  Goldman Sachs  predicted that India's GDP in current prices will overtake France and Italy by 2020, Germany, UK and Russia by 2025 and Japan by 2035. By 2035, it was projected to be the third largest economy of the world, behind US and China. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]   In the revised 2007 figures, based on increased and sustaining growth, more inflows into foreign direct investment, Goldman Sachs predicts that ""from 2007 to 2020, Indias GDP per capita in US$ terms will quadruple"", and that the Indian economy will surpass the  United States  (in US$) by 2043. [ 47 ]  Goldman Sachs has outlined 10 things that it needs to do in order to achieve its potential and grow 40 times by 2050. These are 1.improve governance 2.raise educational achievement 3.increase quality and quantity of universities 4.control inflation 5.introduce a credible fiscal policy 6.liberalize financial markets 7.increase trade with neighbours 8.increase agricultural productivity 9.improve infrastructure and 10.improve environmental quality. [ 48 ]     [ edit ]   Sectors     [ edit ]   Agriculture       Main articles:  Agriculture in India ,  Forestry in India ,  Animal husbandry in India , and  Fishing in India              Composition of India's total production (million tonnes) of foodgrains and commercial crops, in 200304.              Farmers work inside a rice field in  Andhra Pradesh . India is the second largest producer of rice in the world [ 49 ]  and Andhra Pradesh is the 3rd largest rice producing state in India. [ 50 ]       India  ranks second  worldwide in farm output.  Agriculture  and allied sectors like  forestry ,  logging  and  fishing  accounted for 16.6% of the GDP in 2007, employed 60% of the total workforce [ 8 ]  and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic development of India.  Yields  per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in  irrigation , technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since  Green revolution in India . However, international comparisons reveal that the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world. [ 51 ]       Slow agricultural growth is a concern for policymakers as some two-thirds of Indias people depend on rural employment for a living. Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation.      World Bank: ""India Country Overview 2008"" [ 52 ]     The low productivity in India is a result of the following factors:     According to ""India: Priorities for Agriculture and Rural Development"" by World Bank, India's large  agricultural subsidies  are hampering productivity-enhancing investment. Overregulation of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty. Government interventions in labor, land, and credit markets are hurting the market. Infrastructure and services are inadequate. [ 53 ]   Illiteracy, general socio-economic backwardness, slow progress in implementing land reforms and inadequate or inefficient finance and marketing services for farm produce.   The average size of land holdings is very small (less than 20,000 m) and is subject to fragmentation, due to land ceiling acts and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in disguised unemployment and low productivity of labour.   Adoption of modern agricultural practices and use of  technology  is inadequate, hampered by ignorance of such practices, high costs and impracticality in the case of small land holdings.   World Bank says that the allocation of water is inefficient, unsustainable and inequitable. The  irrigation  infrastructure is deteriorating. [ 53 ]  Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only 52.6% of the land was irrigated in 200304, [ 54 ]  which result in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the  Monsoon  season. A good monsoon results in a robust growth for the economy as a whole, while a poor monsoon leads to a sluggish growth. [ 55 ]  Farm credit is regulated by  NABARD , which is the statutory apex agent for rural development in the subcontinent.     India has many farm insurance companies that insure wheat, fruit, rice and rubber farmers in the event of natural disasters or catastrophic crop failure, under the supervision of the  Ministry of Agriculture . One notable company that provides all of these insurance policies is  agriculture insurance company of india  and it alone insures almost 20 million farmers.   India's population is growing faster than its ability to produce rice and wheat. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Industry          Industrial plant in a rural area near  Jodhpur , Rajasthan. Industrial growth in India has provided increase employment opportunities across India.       Industry accounts for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. [ 8 ]  However, about one-third of the industrial labour force is engaged in simple  household manufacturing  only. [ 56 ]  In absolute terms, India  is 16th  in the world in terms of nominal factory output. [ 57 ]  Despite this, India emits only around fifth of the carbon that the United States does. [ 58 ]   Economic reforms brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving  consumer goods . [ 59 ]  Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector, which was usually run by oligopolies of old family firms and required political connections to prosper was faced with foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, focusing on designing new products and relying on low labour costs and technology. [ 60 ]          A  power loom  used in  Ettayapuram       Textile  manufacturing is the second largest source for employment after agriculture and accounts for 26% of manufacturing output. [ 61 ]   Tirupur  has gained universal recognition as the leading source of hosiery, knitted garments, casual wear and sportswear. [ 62 ]   Dharavi  slum in Mumbai has gained fame for leather products.  Tata Motors '  Nano  attempts to be the world's cheapest car. [ 63 ]   India's restrictive labor regulations hamper the large-scale creation of formal industrial jobs. [ 5 ] [ 64 ] [ 9 ]       Indias labor regulations - among the most restrictive and complex in the world - have constrained the growth of the formal manufacturing sector where these laws have their widest application. Better designed labor regulations can attract more labor- intensive investment and create jobs for Indias unemployed millions and those trapped in poor quality jobs. Given the countrys momentum of growth, the window of opportunity must not be lost for improving the job prospects for the 80 million new entrants who are expected to join the work force over the next decade.      World Bank: India Country Overview 2008 [ 52 ]       [ edit ]   Services     See also:  Business process outsourcing in India            A market in Udaipur.       India  is fifteenth  in services output. It provides employment to 23% of work force, and it is growing fast, growth rate 7.5% in 19912000 up from 4.5% in 195180. It has the largest share in the GDP, accounting for 55% in 2007 up from 15% in 1950. [ 8 ]   Business services ( information technology ,  information technology enabled services ,  business process outsourcing ) are among the fastest growing sectors contributing to one third of the total output of services in 2000. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialization, and an availability of a large pool of low cost, but highly skilled, educated and fluent English-speaking workers, on the  supply side , matched on the demand side by an increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's service exports, or those looking to  outsource  their operations.  India's IT industry , despite contributing significantly to its  balance of payments , accounted for only about 1% of the total GDP or 1/50th of the total services in 2001 [ 65 ]  However the contribution of IT to GDP increased to 4.8 % in 2005-06 and is projected to increase to 7% of GDP in 2008 [ 66 ] [ 67 ]   Most Indian shopping takes place in open markets and millions of independent grocery shops called kirana. Organized retail such supermarkets accounts for just 4% of the market as of 2008. [ 68 ]  Regulations prevent most foreign investment in retailing. Moreover, over thirty regulations such as ""signboard licences"" and ""anti-hoarding measures"" may have to be complied before a store can open doors. There are taxes for moving goods to states, from states, and even within states. [ 68 ]   Tourism in India  is relatively undeveloped, but growing at double digits. Some hospitals woo  medical tourism . [ 69 ]     [ edit ]   Finance       Main articles:  Banking in India  and  Insurance in India              Regional office of the  State Bank of India  (SBI), India's largest bank, in Mumbai. The government of India is the largest shareholder in SBI.       The Indian  money market  is classified into: the organised sector (comprising private, public and foreign owned  commercial banks  and  cooperative  banks, together known as  scheduled banks ); and the unorganised sector (comprising individual or family owned indigenous bankers or  money lenders  and  non-banking financial companies  (NBFCs)). The unorganised sector and  microcredit  are still preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes, like ceremonies and short duration loans. [ 70 ]   Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi   nationalised  14 banks in 1969, followed by six others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% of their net credit to priority sectors like agriculture, small-scale industry, retail trade, small businesses, etc. to ensure that the banks fulfill their social and developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased from 10,120 in 1969 to 98,910 in 2003 and the population covered by a branch decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total  deposits  increased 32.6 times between 1971 to 1991 compared to 7 times between 1951 to 1971. Despite an increase of rural branches, from 1,860 or 22% of the total number of branches in 1969 to 32,270 or 48%, only 32,270 out of 5  lakh  (500,000) villages are covered by a scheduled bank. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks (like encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness), other reforms have opened up the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign players. [ 73 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Natural resources     See also:  Energy policy of India            India has the world's 3rd largest coal reserves. [ 74 ]  Shown here is a coal mine in  Jharkhand .       India's total cultivable area is 1,269,219 km (56.78% of total land area), which is decreasing due to constant pressure from an ever growing population and increased urbanisation.   India has a total water surface area of 314,400 km and receives an average annual rainfall of 1,100 mm.  Irrigation  accounts for 92% of the water utilisation, and comprised 380 km in 1974, and is expected to rise to 1,050 km by 2025, with the balance accounted for by industrial and domestic consumers. India's inland water resources comprising rivers, canals, ponds and lakes and marine resources comprising the east and west coasts of the  Indian ocean  and other  gulfs  and  bays  provide employment to nearly 6 million people in the  fisheries  sector. In 2008, India had the world's third largest fishing industry. [ 75 ]   India's major  mineral  resources include  Coal  (3rd-largest reserves in the world),  Iron  ore,  Manganese ,  Mica ,  Bauxite ,  Titanium  ore,  Chromite ,  Natural gas ,  Diamonds ,  Petroleum ,  Limestone  and  Thorium  (world's largest along  Kerala 's shores). India's  oil reserves , found in  Bombay High  off the coast of  Maharashtra ,  Gujarat ,  Rajasthan  and in eastern  Assam  meet 25% of the country's demand. [ 76 ] [ 8 ]   Rising energy demand concomitant with economic growth has created a perpetual state of energy crunch in India. India is poor in oil resources and is currently heavily dependent on coal and foreign oil imports for its energy needs. Though India is rich in  Thorium , but not in  Uranium , which it might get access to in light of the nuclear deal with US. India is rich in certain energy resources which promise significant future potential - clean / renewable energy resources like  solar ,  wind , biofuels (jatropha, sugarcane).

Totals are rounded. Private sector data relates to non-agriculture establishments with 10 or more employees. [ 77 ]       The current government has concluded that most spending fails to reach its intended recipients. [ 78 ]   Lant Pritchett  calls India's public sector ""one of the world's top ten biggest problems - of the order of AIDS and climate change"". [ 78 ]   The Economist 's article about Indian civil service (2008) says that Indian central government employs around 3 million people and states another 7 million, including ""vast armies of paper-shuffling peons"" [ 78 ] . According to a government officer responsible for personnel, India has 80,000 ""Category One""  Indian Administrative Service  (IAS) bureaucrats who make decisions. [ 78 ]  Furthermore, the Economist writes that an elite of merely 5600 members ""mostly runs India"". [ 78 ]  India is divided to 604 districts, size of small countries. [ 78 ]  The Economist described how a district head officer spends 60% of his time dealing individual supplicants asking for things such as alms or firewood instead of larger issues. [ 78 ]  Million dollar bureaucracies can be run without a single computer in the management. [ 78 ]  At local level, administration can be worse. It is not unheard of that most state assembly seats are hold by convicted criminals. [ 79 ]  The Reserve Bank of India has warned that India's public-debt to GDP ratio is over 70 percent. [ 80 ]   One study found out that 25% of public sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers could not be found at the workplace. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 15% in  Maharashtra  to 71% in  Bihar . Only 1 in nearly 3000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence. Despite poorer absence rates, public sector teachers enjoy salaries at least five times higher than private sector teachers. India's absence rates are one of the worst in the world. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ]  A greater private sector role with means such as  education vouchers  has been proposed. [ 83 ]     [ edit ]   Infrastructure          A map of the network of  National Highways  in India              The  Mundra Port  in  Gujarat  is one of the busiest in the Arabian Sea region.       Development of infrastructure was completely in the hands of the public sector and was plagued by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, urban-bias and an inability to scale investment. [ 85 ]  India's low spending on power, construction, transportation, telecommunications and  real estate , at $31 billion or 6% of GDP in 2002 had prevented India from sustaining higher growth rates. This has prompted the government to partially open up infrastructure to the private sector allowing foreign investment [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 77 ]  which has helped in a sustained growth rate of close to 9% for the past six quarters. [ 88 ]   Some 600 million Indians have no mains electricity at all. [ 89 ]  While 80 percent of Indian villages have at least an electricity line, just 44 percent of rural households have access to electricity. [ 90 ]  According to a sample of 97,882 households in 2002, electricity was the main source of lighting for 53% of rural households compared to 36% in 1993. [ 91 ]  Some half of the electricity is stolen, compared with 3% in China. The stolen electricity amounts to 1.5% of GDP. [ 92 ] [ 90 ]  Almost all of the electricity in India is produced by the public sector. Power outages are common. [ 89 ]  Many buy their own power generators to ensure electricity supply. As of 2005 the electricity production was at 661.6 billion kWh with oil production standing at 785,000 bbl/day. In 2007, electricity demand exceeded supply by 15%. [ 89 ]   Multi Commodity Exchange  has tried to get a permit to offer electricity future markets. [ 93 ]   Indian Road Network  is developing. Trucking goods from  Gurgaon  to the port in  Mumbai  can take up to 10 days. [ 94 ]  Taxes and bribes are common between state borders; Transparency International estimates that truckers pay annually $5 billion in bribes. [ 95 ] [ 94 ]  India has  the world's second largest road network . [ 96 ]  Although India has only 1% of the world's vehicles, India has 8 per cent of the world's vehicle fatalities. [ 97 ] [ 98 ]   Container traffic is growing at 15% a year. [ 99 ]  Some 60% of Indias container traffic is handled by the  Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust  in  Mumbai . It has just 9 berths compared to 40 in  Singapore 's main port. It takes an average of 21 days to clear import cargo in India compared to just 3 in Singapore. [ 89 ]  China had 30 times more container traffic in 2004. [ 100 ]   In 2007, an article by Businessweek reported that India's cell-phone market is the fast growing in the world and companies adding some 6 million new customers a month. [ 94 ]  Very few Indians use Internet. As of January 15, 2007, there were 2.10 million broadband lines in India. [ 101 ]  The entire India has only 25,000 tourist-class hotel rooms, compared with more than 140,000 in Las Vegas alone. Hotel companies see opportunities for big investments. [ 94 ]   In some places, no major irrigation works have been done since the British era despite opportunities to boost agricultural productivity. Some 700 million Indians do not have access to a proper toilet. [ 89 ]  Only 13% of sewage is treated according to one estimate, leaving rivers and other water resources under severe strain. [ 89 ]  Most cities supply water only a few hours a day and none provides 24h water.

The Indian rupee is accepted as legal tender in the neighboring  Nepal  and  Bhutan , both of which peg their currency to that of the Indian rupee. The rupee is divided into 100  paise . The highest-denomination banknote is the 1,000 rupee note; the lowest-denomination coin in circulation is the 10 paise coin (it earlier had 1,2 and 5 paise coins which have been discontinued by the Reserve Bank of India). [ 103 ]  There has been a recent fall in the value of the Rupee as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, as foreign institutional investors sold $14 billion worth of Indian stocks in 2008 and invested in US treasury bonds.   India inherited several institutions, such as the  civil services , Reserve Bank of India, railways, etc., from its  British  rulers.  Mumbai  serves as the nation's commercial capital, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),  Bombay Stock Exchange  (BSE) and the  National Stock Exchange  (NSE) located here. The headquarters of many financial institutions are also located in the city.   The RBI, the country's  central bank  was established on April 1, 1935. It serves as the nation's monetary authority, regulator and supervisor of the financial system, manager of exchange control and as an issuer of currency. The RBI is governed by a central board, headed by a governor who is appointed by the Central government of India. The  BSE Sensex  or the BSE Sensitive Index is a value-weighted index composed of 30 companies with April 1979 as the base year (100). These companies have the largest and most actively traded stocks and are representative of various sectors, on the Exchange. They account for around one-fifth of the market capitalisation of the BSE. The Sensex is generally regarded as the most popular and precise  barometer  of the Indian stock markets. Incorporated in 1992, the National Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most advanced stock markets in India. The NSE is the world's third largest stock exchange in terms of transactions. There are a total of 23 stock exchanges in India, but the BSE and NSE comprise 83% of the volumes.

[ 115 ]  The average is 103 sq ft per person in rural areas and 117 sq ft per person in urban areas. [ 115 ]   Poverty in India  is some of the starkest in the world. Around half of Indian children are malnourished. The proportion of underweight children is nearly double that of Sub-Saharan Africa. [ 18 ] [ 116 ]  However, India has not had  famines  since the  Green Revolution  in the early 1970s. While poverty in India has reduced significantly, official figures estimate that 27.5% [ 117 ]  of Indians still lived below the national poverty line of $1 (PPP, around 10 rupees in nominal terms) a day in 2004-2005. [ 118 ]  A 2007 report by the state-run National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) found that 65% of Indians, or 750 million people, lived on less than 20 rupees per day [ 119 ]  with most working in ""informal labour sector with no job or social security, living in abject poverty."" [ 120 ]   Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under  planning , to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. All these programmes have relied upon the strategies of the  Food for work  programme and  National Rural Employment Programme  of the 1980s, which attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. [ 77 ]  In August 2005, the  Indian parliament  passed the  Rural Employment Guarantee Bill , the largest programme of this type in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of  India's 600 districts . The question of whether economic reforms have reduced poverty or not has fuelled debates without generating any clear cut answers and has also put political pressure on further economic reforms, especially those involving the downsizing of labour and cutting agricultural subsidies. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]     [ edit ]   Education   Further information:  Education in India          Boys seated in school near  Baroda ,  Gujarat .       Fewer than 40 percent of adolescents in India attend secondary schools. [ 123 ]  Only 16% of manufacturers in India offer in-service training to their employees, compared with over 90% in China. [ 124 ]  Overall, one estimate is that only one in five job-seekers in India has ever had any sort of  vocational training . [ 9 ]   Among developing countries, India stands out for its spectacularly low levels of occupational and geographic mobility. [ 125 ]     [ edit ]   Employment   Agricultural and allied sectors accounted for about 57% of the total workforce in 19992000, down from 60% in 199394. While agriculture has faced stagnation in growth, services have seen a steady growth. Of the total workforce, 8% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in the public sector. The NSSO survey estimated that in 19992000, 106 million, nearly 10% of the population were unemployed and the overall unemployment rate was 7.32%, with rural areas doing marginally better (7.21%) than urban areas (7.65%). India's labor force is growing by 2.5% every year, but employment is growing only at 2.3% a year. [ 126 ]   Unemployment in India is characterized by chronic  underemployment  or  disguised unemployment . Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and unemployment (which in recent decades has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods) attempt to solve the problem, by providing financial assistance for setting up businesses, skill honing, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decreased role of the public sector after liberalization has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and has also put political pressure on further reforms. [ 127 ] [ 77 ]   In 2006,  remittances  from Indian migrants overseas made up $27 billion or about 3% of India's GDP. [ 128 ]     [ edit ]   Corruption       Main article:  Corruption in India       India ranked 120th on the  Ease of Doing Business Index  2008, behind countries such as  China  (83rd),  Pakistan  (86th), and  Nigeria  (108th).   Corruption  has been one of the pervasive problems affecting India. The economic reforms of 1991 reduced the  red tape , bureaucracy and the  Licence Raj  that had strangled private enterprise and was blamed for the corruption and inefficiencies. Yet, a 2005 study by  Transparency International  (TI) India found that more than half of those surveyed had firsthand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office. [ 129 ]   The  Right to Information Act  (2005) and equivalent acts in the states, that require government officials to furnish information requested by citizens or face punitive action, computerisation of services and various central and state government acts that established vigilance commissions have considerably reduced corruption or at least have opened up avenues to redress grievances. [ 129 ]  The 2007 report by Transparency International ranks India at 72nd place and states that significant improvements were made by India in reducing corruption. [ 130 ] [ 131 ]     [ edit ]   Regional imbalance     See also:  States of India by size of economy  and  List of regions of India            A rural man drying  cow dung  in  Bihar , the poorest state in India.       One of the critical problems facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India's different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development. [ 132 ]  Seven low-income states -  Bihar ,  Chhattisgarh ,  Jharkhand ,  Madhya Pradesh ,  Orissa ,  Rajasthan , and  Uttar Pradesh  - are home to more than half of India's population. [ 124 ]   Between 1999 and 2008, the annualized growth rates for  Gujarat  (8.8%),  Haryana  (8.7%), or  Delhi  (7.4%) were much higher than for  Bihar  (5.1%),  Uttar Pradesh  (4.4%), or  Madhya Pradesh  (3.5%). [ 133 ]   Poverty rates in rural  Orissa  (43%) and rural  Bihar  (40%) are some of the worst in the world. [ 100 ]  On the other hand, rural  Haryana  (5.7%) and rural  Punjab  (2.4%) compare well with middle-income countries. [ 100 ]   The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities [ 134 ]  After liberalization, the more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]       Lagging states need to bring more jobs to their people by creating an attractive investment destination. Reforming cumbersome regulatory procedures, improving rural connectivity, establishing law and order, creating a stable platform for natural resource investment that balances business interests with social concerns, and providing rural finance are important.

On Yale and Columbia's  Environmental Performance Index , India's score is 21/100 on sanitation, compared with 67/100 for the region and 48/100 for the country income group. [ 137 ]   About 1.2 billion people in developing nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. [ 138 ]  Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). [ 139 ]  114 cities dump untreated  sewage  and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. [ 140 ]  Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as other developing countries. NewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred  Yamuna River  as ""a putrid ribbon of black sludge"" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem. [ 137 ]   Cholera  epidemics are not unknown. [ 137 ]  Open  defecation  is widespread even in urban areas of India. [ 141 ] [ 142 ]   Indoor air pollution from burning wood, coal and animal dung is widespread. [ 143 ]  70% of rural households in India lack ventilation. Particulate concentrations in houses are reported to range from 8,300 to 15,000 g/m 3 , greatly exceeding the 75 g/m 3  maximum standard for indoor particulate matter in the United States. [ 144 ]   Changes in ecosystem biological diversity, evolution of parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as  cholera  which emerged in 1992 in India. The frequency of  AIDS / HIV  is increasing. In 1996, about 46,000 Indians out of 2.8 million (1.6 % of the population) tested were found to be infected with HIV. [ 145 ]   Even in the rich regions, health care is poor. World Bank reports that ""a detailed survey of the knowledge of medical practitioners for treating five common conditions in Delhi found that the typical quality doctor in a public primary health center has a more than 50-50 chance of recommending a harmful treatment"". The competence rating of India's doctors is below  Tanzania 's. [ 100 ]     [ edit ]   External trade and investment     [ edit ]   Global trade relations          Indian exports in 2006              According to the CIA Factbook (2007), India is a net importer. Total imports stood at US$224 billion and exports were US$140 billion. Shown here is the cargo of a container ship being unloaded at the  Jawaharlal Nehru Port ,  Navi Mumbai       International trade  as a proportion of GDP reached 24% by 2006, up from 6% in 1985 and still relatively moderate. [ 5 ] [ 146 ]   India currently accounts for 1.2% of World trade as of 2006 according to the WTO. [ 147 ]  Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledging economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while  foreign direct investment  was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200M annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of  non-resident Indians . [ 148 ]   India's exports were stagnant for the first 15 years after independence, due to the predominance of tea, jute and  cotton  manufactures, demand for which was generally  inelastic . Imports in the same period consisted predominantly of machinery, equipment and raw materials, due to nascent industrialisation. Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade has become more broad-based and has risen to Rs. 63,080,109  crores  in 200304 from Rs.1,250 crores in 195051. [ citation needed ]  India's major trading partners are China, the US, the UAE, the UK, Japan and the EU. [ 149 ]  The exports during April 2007 were $12.31 billion up by 16% and import were $17.68 billion with an increase of 18.06% over the previous year. [ 150 ]   India is a founding-member of  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) since 1947 and its successor, the  World Trade Organization . While participating actively in its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the  developing world . For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of such matters as labour and environment issues and other  non-tariff barriers  into the WTO policies. [ 151 ]   Despite reducing import restrictions several times in the 2000s, [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  India was evaluated by the World Trade Organization in 2008 as more restrictive than similar developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and Russia. The WTO also identified electricity shortages and inadequate transportation infrastructure as significant constraints on trade.  [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ]  Its restrictiveness has been cited as a factor which has isolated it from the  global financial crisis of 20082009  more than other countries, even though it has reduced ongoing economic growth. [ 157 ]     [ edit ]   Balance of payments   Since independence, India's  balance of payments  on its  current account  has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India's exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 200203, up from 66.2% in 199091. Although India is still a net importer, since 199697, its overall balance of payments (i.e., including the  capital account  balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from  non-resident Indians ; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings. As a result, India's foreign currency reserves stood at $285 billion in 2008, which could be used in infrastructural development of the country if used effectively.   India's reliance on external assistance and commercial borrowings has decreased since 199192, and since 200203, it has gradually been repaying these debts. Declining interest rates and reduced borrowings decreased India's debt service ratio to 4.5% in 2007. [ 158 ]  In India,  External Commercial Borrowings  (ECBs) are being permitted by the Government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The  Ministry of Finance  monitors and regulates these borrowings (ECBs) through ECB policy guidelines. [ 159 ]     [ edit ]   Investment     Share of top five investing countries in FDI inflows. (20002007) [ 160 ]     Rank   Country   Inflows  (Million USD)   Inflows (%)       1     Mauritius   85,178   44.24% [ 161 ]       2     United States   18,040   9.37%       3     United Kingdom   15,363   7.98%       4     Netherlands   11,177   5.81%       5     Singapore   9,742   5.06%       Foreign direct investment  in India has reached 2% of GDP, compared with 0.1% in 1990, and Indian investment in other countries rose sharply in 2006. [ 5 ]   As the fourth-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India is a preferred destination for  foreign direct investments  (FDI); [ 162 ]  India has strengths in information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and jewellery. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies resulted in a significant hindrance. However, due to some positive economic reforms aimed at deregulating the economy and stimulating foreign investment, India has positioned itself as one of the front-runners of the rapidly growing Asia Pacific Region. [ 162 ]  India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 50 million and represents a growing consumer market. [ 163 ]   India's recently liberalized FDI policy (2005) allows up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and foreign direct investment FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalized FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100 per cent FDI in the construction business. [ 164 ]  This automatic route has been permitted in townships, housing, built-up infrastructure and construction development projects including housing, commercial premises, hotels, resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.   A number of changes were approved on the FDI policy to remove the caps in most sectors. Fields which require relaxation in FDI restrictions include civil aviation, construction development, industrial parks, petroleum and natural gas, commodity exchanges, credit-information services and mining. But this still leaves an unfinished agenda of permitting greater foreign investment in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing. FDI inflows into India reached a record US$19.5bn in fiscal year 2006/07 (April-March), according to the government's Secretariat for Industrial Assistance. This was more than double the total of US$7.8bn in the previous fiscal year. The FDI inflow for 2007-08 has been reported as $24bn [ 165 ]  and for 2008-09, it is expected to be above $35 billion. [ 166 ]  A critical factor in determining India's continued economic growth and realizing the potential to be an economic superpower is going to depend on how the government can create incentives for FDI flow across a large number of sectors in India.

The economy was shackled by  extensive regulation ,  protectionism , and public ownership, leading to  pervasive corruption  and  slow growth . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  Since 1991,  continuing economic liberalization  has moved the economy towards a  market-based system . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   Agriculture  is the predominant occupation in India, accounting for 60% of employment.  Service sector  makes up 28% and  industrial sector  12%. [ 8 ]  One estimate is that only one in five job-seekers has had any sort of  vocational training . [ 9 ]  The labor force totals  half billion people . In terms of output, the agricultural sector accounts for 28% of GDP; the service and industrial sectors make up 54% and 18% respectively. Major agricultural products include  rice ,  wheat ,  oilseed ,  cotton ,  jute ,  tea ,  sugarcane ,  potatoes ;  cattle ,  water buffalo ,  sheep ,  goats ,  poultry ;  fish .. [ 10 ]  Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, software. [ 10 ]  India's GDP is US$1.089 trillion, which makes it the  twelfth-largest  economy in the world [ 11 ]  or  fourth largest  by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates. India's nominal  per capita income  US$977 is ranked  128th  in the world. In the late 2000s, India's  economic growth  has averaged 7% a year, which will double the average income in a decade. [ 5 ]   Previously a closed economy, India's trade has grown fast. [ 5 ] India currently accounts for 1.5% of World trade as of 2007 according to the WTO. According to the World Trade Statistics of the WTO in 2006, India's total merchandise trade (export + import) was valued at 294 billion dollars in 2006 and India's services trade inclusive of export and import was 143 billion dollars. Thus, India's global economic engagement in 2006 covering both merchandise and services trade was of the order of 437 billion dollars, up by a record 72 percent from a level of 253 billion dollars in 2004. [ 12 ]  India's trade has reached a still relatively moderate share 24% of GDP in 2006, up from 6% in 1985. [ 5 ]   India remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Although the Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades; its growth has been uneven when comparing different social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas. Unemployment rate is 7.2% (2007 estimate). [ 13 ]   [ 14 ] The percentage of people living below the new  international poverty line  $1.25 a day (PPP, in nominal terms Rs 21.6 a day in urban areas and Rs 14.3 in rural areas in 2005) decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. [ 15 ] . 85.7% of the population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) a day in 2005, compared with 80.5% for  Sub-Saharan Africa . [ 16 ]  Even though the arrival of  Green Revolution  brought end to  famines in India [ 17 ] , half of children are  underweight , one of the highest rates in the world and nearly double the rate of Sub-Saharan Africa.

The advent of British colonisation started the colonial period in the 17th century, which ended with  independence  in 1947. The third period stretches from independence in 1947 until now.     [ edit ]   Pre-colonial   The citizens of the  Indus Valley civilisation , a permanent and predominantly urban settlement that flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well planned streets, a drainage system and water supply reveals their knowledge of  urban planning , which included the world's first urban  sanitation  systems and the existence of a form of  municipal government . [ 19 ]          Silver coin minted during the reign of the  Gupta  king  Kumara Gupta I  (AD 41455)       The 1872 census revealed that 99.3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages, [ 20 ]  whose economies were largely isolated and self-sustaining, with agriculture the predominant occupation. This satisfied the food requirements of the village and provided raw materials for hand-based industries, such as  textiles ,  food processing  and  crafts . Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins,  barter  was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while its craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services. [ 21 ]   Religion, especially  Hinduism , and the  caste  and the  joint family  systems, played an influential role in shaping economic activities. [ 22 ]  The caste system functioned much like medieval European  guilds , ensuring the  division of labour , providing for the training of apprentices and, in some cases, allowing manufacturers to achieve narrow specialization. For instance, in certain regions, producing each variety of cloth was the speciality of a particular sub-caste.          Estimates of the per capita income of India (18571900) as per 194849 prices. [ 23 ]       Textiles such as  muslin ,  Calicos ,  shawls , and agricultural products such as  pepper ,  cinnamon ,  opium  and  indigo  were exported to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia in return for gold and silver. [ 24 ]   Assessment of India's pre-colonial economy is mostly qualitative, owing to the lack of quantitative information. One estimate puts the revenue of  Akbar 's  Mughal Empire  in 1600 at   17.5 million, in contrast with the total revenue of Great Britain in 1800, which totalled 16 million. [ 25 ]  India, by the time of the arrival of the British, was a largely traditional agrarian economy with a dominant subsistence sector dependent on primitive technology. It existed alongside a competitively developed network of commerce, manufacturing and credit. After the fall of the  Mughals , India was administered by  Maratha Empire . The Maratha Empire's budget in 1740s, at its peak, was Rs. 100 million. After the loss at Panipat, the Maratha Empire disintegrated into confederate states of Gwalior, Baroda, Indore, Jhansi, Nagpur, Pune and Kolhapur. Gwalior state had a budget of Rs. 30M. However, at this time, British East India company entered the Indian political theatre. Until 1857, when India was firmly under the British crown, the country remained in a state of political instability due to internecine wars and conflicts. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Colonial          An aerial view of Calcutta Port taken in 1945.  Calcutta , which was the economic hub of British India, saw increased industrial activity during  World War II .       Company rule in India  brought a major change in the taxation environment from revenue taxes to property taxes resulting in mass impoverishment and destitution of the great majority of farmers, resulting in numerous famines. [ 27 ]  The economic policies of the  British Raj  effectively destroyed India's large handicrafts industry and caused a massive drain of India's resources. [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  An estimate by  Cambridge University  historian Angus Maddison reveals that India's share of the world income fell from 22.6% in 1700, comparable to Europe's share of 23.3%, to a low of 3.8% in 1952. [ 30 ]  It also created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed  property rights  among the colonizers, encouraged  free trade , and created a single currency with  fixed exchange rates , standardized weights and measures,  capital markets , a well developed system of  railways  and  telegraphs , a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference, and a common-law, adversarial legal system. [ 31 ]  India's colonisation by the British coincided with major changes in the world economyindustrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world, [ 32 ]  with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, one of the world's lowest  life expectancies , and low rates of  literacy .   The impact of the British rule on India's economy is a controversial topic. While leaders of the  Indian independence movement , and left-nationalist  economic historians  have blamed colonial rule for the dismal state of India's economy in its aftermath, right-wing historians have countered that India's economic performance was due to various sectors being in a state of growth and decline, resulting from changes brought about by colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialization and  economic integration . [ 33 ]     [ edit ]   Independence to 1991   Indian  economic policy  after  independence  was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders' exposure to  Fabian socialism . Policy tended towards  protectionism , with a strong emphasis on  import substitution ,  industrialization ,  state intervention  in labor and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and  central planning . [ 34 ]   Five-Year Plans of India  resembled central planning in the  Soviet Union . Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalized in the mid-1950s. [ 35 ]  Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying  red tape , commonly referred to as  Licence Raj , were required to set up business in  India  between 1947 and 1990. [ 36 ]   Jawaharlal Nehru , the first  prime minister , along with the statistician  Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis , carried on by  Indira Gandhi  formulated and oversaw economic policy. They expected favorable outcomes from this strategy, because it involved both public and private sectors and was based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme  Soviet-style  central command system. [ 37 ]  The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive  heavy industry  and subsidizing manual, low-skill  cottage industries  was criticized by economist  Milton Friedman , who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers. [ 38 ]   India's low average growth rate from 194780 was derisively referred to as the  Hindu rate of growth , because of the unfavourable comparison with growth rates in other Asian countries, especially the  ""East Asian Tigers"" . [ 31 ]   The  Rockefeller Foundation 's research in  high-yielding varieties of seeds , their introduction after 1965 and the increased use of  fertilizers  and  irrigation  are known collectively as the  Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self-sufficient in food grains, thus improving  agriculture in India .  Famine in India , once accepted as inevitable, has not returned since the introduction of Green Revolution crops.     [ edit ]   After 1991       Main article:  Economic liberalization in India              Major improvements in educational standards across India has helped its economic rise. Shown here is the  Indian School of Business  at  Hyderabad , ranked number 20 in global MBA rankings by the  Financial Times  of London in 2008 [ 39 ]       In the late 80s, the government led by  Rajiv Gandhi  eased restrictions on capacity expansion for incumbents, removed price controls and reduced corporate taxes. While this increased the rate of growth, it also led to high fiscal deficits and a worsening current account. The collapse of the  Soviet Union , which was India's major trading partner, and the  first Gulf War , which caused a spike in oil prices, caused a major balance-of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of defaulting on its loans. [ 40 ]  India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from  IMF , which in return demanded reforms. [ 41 ]   In response, Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao  along with his finance minister  Manmohan Singh  initiated the  economic liberalisation of 1991 . The reforms did away with the  Licence Raj  (investment, industrial and import licensing) and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of  foreign direct investment  in many sectors. [ 42 ]  Since then, the overall direction of liberalisation has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the  trade unions  and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. [ 43 ]  Since 1990 India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the developing world; during this period, the economy has grown constantly, but with a few major setbacks. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates and food security.   While the credit rating of India was hit by its nuclear tests in 1998, it has been raised to investment level in 2007 by S&P and Moody's. [ 44 ]  In 2003,  Goldman Sachs  predicted that India's GDP in current prices will overtake France and Italy by 2020, Germany, UK and Russia by 2025 and Japan by 2035. By 2035, it was projected to be the third largest economy of the world, behind US and China. [ 45 ] [ 46 ]   In the revised 2007 figures, based on increased and sustaining growth, more inflows into foreign direct investment, Goldman Sachs predicts that ""from 2007 to 2020, Indias GDP per capita in US$ terms will quadruple"", and that the Indian economy will surpass the  United States  (in US$) by 2043.

These are 1.improve governance 2.raise educational achievement 3.increase quality and quantity of universities 4.control inflation 5.introduce a credible fiscal policy 6.liberalize financial markets 7.increase trade with neighbours 8.increase agricultural productivity 9.improve infrastructure and 10.improve environmental quality. [ 48 ]     [ edit ]   Sectors     [ edit ]   Agriculture       Main articles:  Agriculture in India ,  Forestry in India ,  Animal husbandry in India , and  Fishing in India              Composition of India's total production (million tonnes) of foodgrains and commercial crops, in 200304.              Farmers work inside a rice field in  Andhra Pradesh . India is the second largest producer of rice in the world [ 49 ]  and Andhra Pradesh is the 3rd largest rice producing state in India. [ 50 ]       India  ranks second  worldwide in farm output.  Agriculture  and allied sectors like  forestry ,  logging  and  fishing  accounted for 16.6% of the GDP in 2007, employed 60% of the total workforce [ 8 ]  and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic development of India.  Yields  per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in  irrigation , technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since  Green revolution in India . However, international comparisons reveal that the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world. [ 51 ]       Slow agricultural growth is a concern for policymakers as some two-thirds of Indias people depend on rural employment for a living. Current agricultural practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable and India's yields for many agricultural commodities are low. Poorly maintained irrigation systems and almost universal lack of good extension services are among the factors responsible. Farmers' access to markets is hampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation.      World Bank: ""India Country Overview 2008"" [ 52 ]     The low productivity in India is a result of the following factors:     According to ""India: Priorities for Agriculture and Rural Development"" by World Bank, India's large  agricultural subsidies  are hampering productivity-enhancing investment. Overregulation of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty. Government interventions in labor, land, and credit markets are hurting the market. Infrastructure and services are inadequate. [ 53 ]   Illiteracy, general socio-economic backwardness, slow progress in implementing land reforms and inadequate or inefficient finance and marketing services for farm produce.   The average size of land holdings is very small (less than 20,000 m) and is subject to fragmentation, due to land ceiling acts and in some cases, family disputes. Such small holdings are often over-manned, resulting in disguised unemployment and low productivity of labour.   Adoption of modern agricultural practices and use of  technology  is inadequate, hampered by ignorance of such practices, high costs and impracticality in the case of small land holdings.   World Bank says that the allocation of water is inefficient, unsustainable and inequitable. The  irrigation  infrastructure is deteriorating. [ 53 ]  Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only 52.6% of the land was irrigated in 200304, [ 54 ]  which result in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the  Monsoon  season. A good monsoon results in a robust growth for the economy as a whole, while a poor monsoon leads to a sluggish growth. [ 55 ]  Farm credit is regulated by  NABARD , which is the statutory apex agent for rural development in the subcontinent.     India has many farm insurance companies that insure wheat, fruit, rice and rubber farmers in the event of natural disasters or catastrophic crop failure, under the supervision of the  Ministry of Agriculture . One notable company that provides all of these insurance policies is  agriculture insurance company of india  and it alone insures almost 20 million farmers.   India's population is growing faster than its ability to produce rice and wheat. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Industry          Industrial plant in a rural area near  Jodhpur , Rajasthan. Industrial growth in India has provided increase employment opportunities across India.       Industry accounts for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. [ 8 ]  However, about one-third of the industrial labour force is engaged in simple  household manufacturing  only. [ 56 ]  In absolute terms, India  is 16th  in the world in terms of nominal factory output. [ 57 ]  Despite this, India emits only around fifth of the carbon that the United States does. [ 58 ]   Economic reforms brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving  consumer goods . [ 59 ]  Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector, which was usually run by oligopolies of old family firms and required political connections to prosper was faced with foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, focusing on designing new products and relying on low labour costs and technology. [ 60 ]          A  power loom  used in  Ettayapuram       Textile  manufacturing is the second largest source for employment after agriculture and accounts for 26% of manufacturing output. [ 61 ]   Tirupur  has gained universal recognition as the leading source of hosiery, knitted garments, casual wear and sportswear. [ 62 ]   Dharavi  slum in Mumbai has gained fame for leather products.  Tata Motors '  Nano  attempts to be the world's cheapest car. [ 63 ]   India's restrictive labor regulations hamper the large-scale creation of formal industrial jobs. [ 5 ] [ 64 ] [ 9 ]       Indias labor regulations - among the most restrictive and complex in the world - have constrained the growth of the formal manufacturing sector where these laws have their widest application. Better designed labor regulations can attract more labor- intensive investment and create jobs for Indias unemployed millions and those trapped in poor quality jobs. Given the countrys momentum of growth, the window of opportunity must not be lost for improving the job prospects for the 80 million new entrants who are expected to join the work force over the next decade.      World Bank: India Country Overview 2008 [ 52 ]       [ edit ]   Services     See also:  Business process outsourcing in India            A market in Uidapur.       India  is fifteenth  in services output. It provides employment to 23% of work force, and it is growing fast, growth rate 7.5% in 19912000 up from 4.5% in 195180. It has the largest share in the GDP, accounting for 55% in 2007 up from 15% in 1950. [ 8 ]   Business services ( information technology ,  information technology enabled services ,  business process outsourcing ) are among the fastest growing sectors contributing to one third of the total output of services in 2000. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialization, and an availability of a large pool of low cost, but highly skilled, educated and fluent English-speaking workers, on the  supply side , matched on the demand side by an increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's service exports, or those looking to  outsource  their operations.  India's IT industry , despite contributing significantly to its  balance of payments , accounted for only about 1% of the total GDP or 1/50th of the total services in 2001 [ 65 ]  However the contribution of IT to GDP increased to 4.8 % in 2005-06 and is projected to increase to 7% of GDP in 2008 [ 66 ] [ 67 ]   Most Indian shopping takes place in open markets and millions of independent grocery shops called kirana. Organized retail such supermarkets accounts for just 4% of the market as of 2008. [ 68 ]  Regulations prevent most foreign investment in retailing. Moreover, over thirty regulations such as ""signboard licences"" and ""anti-hoarding measures"" may have to be complied before a store can open doors. There are taxes for moving goods to states, from states, and even within states. [ 68 ]   Tourism in India  is relatively undeveloped, but growing at double digits. Some hospitals woo  medical tourism .

The government of India is the largest shareholder in SBI.       The Indian  money market  is classified into: the organised sector (comprising private, public and foreign owned  commercial banks  and  cooperative  banks, together known as  scheduled banks ); and the unorganised sector (comprising individual or family owned indigenous bankers or  money lenders  and  non-banking financial companies  (NBFCs)). The unorganised sector and  microcredit  are still preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes, like ceremonies and short duration loans. [ 70 ]   Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi   nationalised  14 banks in 1969, followed by six others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% of their net credit to priority sectors like agriculture, small-scale industry, retail trade, small businesses, etc. to ensure that the banks fulfill their social and developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased from 10,120 in 1969 to 98,910 in 2003 and the population covered by a branch decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total  deposits  increased 32.6 times between 1971 to 1991 compared to 7 times between 1951 to 1971. Despite an increase of rural branches, from 1,860 or 22% of the total number of branches in 1969 to 32,270 or 48%, only 32,270 out of 5  lakh  (500,000) villages are covered by a scheduled bank. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]   Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks (like encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness), other reforms have opened up the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign players. [ 73 ] [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Natural resources     See also:  Energy policy of India            India has the world's 3rd largest coal reserves. [ 74 ]  Shown here is a coal mine in  Jharkhand .       India's total cultivable area is 1,269,219 km (56.78% of total land area), which is decreasing due to constant pressure from an ever growing population and increased urbanisation.   India has a total water surface area of 314,400 km and receives an average annual rainfall of 1,100 mm.  Irrigation  accounts for 92% of the water utilisation, and comprised 380 km in 1974, and is expected to rise to 1,050 km by 2025, with the balance accounted for by industrial and domestic consumers. India's inland water resources comprising rivers, canals, ponds and lakes and marine resources comprising the east and west coasts of the  Indian ocean  and other  gulfs  and  bays  provide employment to nearly 6 million people in the  fisheries  sector. In 2008, India had the world's third largest fishing industry. [ 75 ]   India's major  mineral  resources include  Coal  (3rd-largest reserves in the world),  Iron  ore,  Manganese ,  Mica ,  Bauxite ,  Titanium  ore,  Chromite ,  Natural gas ,  Diamonds ,  Petroleum ,  Limestone  and  Thorium  (world's largest along  Kerala 's shores). India's  oil reserves , found in  Bombay High  off the coast of  Maharashtra ,  Gujarat , and in eastern  Assam  meet 25% of the country's demand. [ 76 ] [ 8 ]   Rising energy demand concomitant with economic growth has created a perpetual state of energy crunch in India. India is poor in oil resources and is currently heavily dependent on coal and foreign oil imports for its energy needs. Though India is rich in  Thorium , but not in  Uranium , which it might get access to in light of the nuclear deal with US. India is rich in certain energy resources which promise significant future potential - clean / renewable energy resources like  solar ,  wind , biofuels (jatropha, sugarcane).

Totals are rounded. Private sector data relates to non-agriculture establishments with 10 or more employees. [ 77 ]       The current government has concluded that most spending fails to reach its intended recipients. [ 78 ]   Lant Pritchett  calls India's public sector ""one of the world's top ten biggest problems - of the order of AIDS and climate change"". [ 78 ]   The Economist 's article about Indian civil service (2008) says that Indian central government employs around 3 million people and states another 7 million, including ""vast armies of paper-shuffling peons"" [ 78 ] . According to a government officer responsible for personnel, India has 80,000 ""Category One""  Indian Administrative Service  (IAS) bureaucrats who make decisions. [ 78 ]  Furthermore, the Economist writes that an elite of merely 5600 members ""mostly runs India"". [ 78 ]  India is divided to 604 districts, size of small countries. [ 78 ]  The Economist described how a district head officer spends 60% of his time dealing individual supplicants asking for things such as alms or firewood instead of larger issues. [ 78 ]  Million dollar bureaucracies can be run without a single computer in the management. [ 78 ]  At local level, administration can be worse. It is not unheard of that most state assembly seats are hold by convicted criminals. [ 79 ]  The Reserve Bank of India has warned that India's public-debt to GDP ratio is over 70 percent. [ 80 ]   One study found out that 25% of public sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers could not be found at the workplace. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 15% in  Maharashtra  to 71% in  Bihar . Only 1 in nearly 3000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence. Despite poorer absence rates, public sector teachers enjoy salaries at least five times higher than private sector teachers. India's absence rates are one of the worst in the world. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ]  A greater private sector role with means such as  education vouchers  has been proposed.

Development of infrastructure was completely in the hands of the public sector and was plagued by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, urban-bias and an inability to scale investment. [ 85 ]  India's low spending on power, construction, transportation, telecommunications and  real estate , at $31 billion or 6% of GDP in 2002 had prevented India from sustaining higher growth rates. This has prompted the government to partially open up infrastructure to the private sector allowing foreign investment [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 77 ]  which has helped in a sustained growth rate of close to 9% for the past six quarters. [ 88 ]   Some 600 million Indians have no mains electricity at all. [ 89 ]  While 80 percent of Indian villages have at least an electricity line, just 44 percent of rural households have access to electricity. [ 90 ]  According to a sample of 97,882 households in 2002, electricity was the main source of lighting for 53% of rural households compared to 36% in 1993. [ 91 ]  Some half of the electricity is stolen, compared with 3% in China. The stolen electricity amounts to 1.5% of GDP. [ 92 ] [ 90 ]  Almost all of the electricity in India is produced by the public sector. Power outages are common. [ 89 ]  Many buy their own power generators to ensure electricity supply. As of 2005 the electricity production was at 661.6 billion kWh with oil production standing at 785,000 bbl/day. In 2007, electricity demand exceeded supply by 15%. [ 89 ]   Multi Commodity Exchange  has tried to get a permit to offer electricity future markets. [ 93 ]   Indian Road Network  is developing. Trucking goods from  Gurgaon  to the port in  Mumbai  can take up to 10 days. [ 94 ]  Taxes and bribes are common between state borders; Transparency International estimates that truckers pay annually $5 billion in bribes. [ 95 ] [ 94 ]  India has  the world's second largest road network . [ 96 ]  Although India has only 1% of the world's vehicles, India has 8 per cent of the world's vehicle fatalities.

It has just 9 berths compared to 40 in  Singapore 's main port. It takes an average of 21 days to clear import cargo in India compared to just 3 in Singapore. [ 89 ]  China had 30 times more container traffic in 2004. [ 100 ]   In 2007, an article by Businessweek reported that India's cell-phone market is the fast growing in the world and companies adding some 6 million new customers a month. [ 94 ]  Very few Indians use Internet. As of January 15, 2007, there were 2.10 million broadband lines in India. [ 101 ]  The entire India has only 25,000 tourist-class hotel rooms, compared with more than 140,000 in Las Vegas alone. Hotel companies see opportunities for big investments. [ 94 ]   In some places, no major irrigation works have been done since the British era despite opportunities to boost agricultural productivity. Some 700 million Indians do not have access to a proper toilet. [ 89 ]  Only 13% of sewage is treated according to one estimate, leaving rivers and other water resources under severe strain. [ 89 ]  Most cities supply water only a few hours a day and none provides 24h water.

The Indian rupee is accepted as legal tender in the neighboring  Nepal  and  Bhutan , both of which peg their currency to that of the Indian rupee. The rupee is divided into 100  paise . The highest-denomination banknote is the 1,000 rupee note; the lowest-denomination coin in circulation is the 1 rupee coin (it earlier had 25 & 50 paise coins which have been discontinued by the Reserve Bank of India). [ 103 ]  There has been a recent fall in the value of the Rupee as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, as foreign institutional investors sell large amounts of Indian stocks and invest in US treasury bonds.   India inherited several institutions, such as the  civil services , Reserve Bank of India, railways, etc., from its  British  rulers.  Mumbai  serves as the nation's commercial capital, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),  Bombay Stock Exchange  (BSE) and the  National Stock Exchange  (NSE) located here. The headquarters of many financial institutions are also located in the city.   The RBI, the country's  central bank  was established on April 1, 1935. It serves as the nation's monetary authority, regulator and supervisor of the financial system, manager of exchange control and as an issuer of currency. The RBI is governed by a central board, headed by a governor who is appointed by the Central government of India. The  BSE Sensex  or the BSE Sensitive Index is a value-weighted index composed of 30 companies with April 1979 as the base year (100). These companies have the largest and most actively traded stocks and are representative of various sectors, on the Exchange. They account for around one-fifth of the market capitalisation of the BSE. The Sensex is generally regarded as the most popular and precise  barometer  of the Indian stock markets. Incorporated in 1992, the National Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most advanced stock markets in India. The NSE is the world's third largest stock exchange in terms of transactions. There are a total of 23 stock exchanges in India, but the BSE and NSE comprise 83% of the volumes.

As of 2005, 85.7% of the population lives on less than $2.50 (PPP) a day, down from 92.5% in 1981. This compares with 80.5% in  Sub-Saharan Africa . [ 108 ]  75.6% of the population lives on less than $2 a day (PPP), which is around 20 rupees or $0.5 a day in nominal terms. It was down from 86.6% and compares with 73.0% in Sub-Saharan Africa.

[ 108 ]  The World Bank further estimates that a third of the global poor now reside in India.   Today, more people afford to a  bicycle  than ever before. Some 40% of Indian households owns a bicycle, with ownership rates ranging from around 30% to 70% at state level. [ 114 ]  Housing is still very modest. According to Times of India, ""a majority of Indians have per capita space equivalent to or less than a 10 feet x 10 feet room for their living, sleeping, cooking, washing and toilet needs."" and ""one in every three urban Indians lives in homes too cramped to exceed even the minimum requirements of a prison cell in the US."" [ 115 ]  The average is 103 sq ft per person in rural areas and 117 sq ft per person in urban areas. [ 115 ]   Poverty in India  is some of the starkest in the world. Around half of Indian children are malnourished. The proportion of underweight children is nearly double that of Sub-Saharan Africa. [ 18 ] [ 116 ]  However, India has not had  famines  since the  Green Revolution  in the early 1970s. While poverty in India has reduced significantly, official figures estimate that 27.5% [ 117 ]  of Indians still lived below the national poverty line of $1 (PPP, around 10 rupees in nominal terms) a day in 2004-2005. [ 118 ]  A 2007 report by the state-run National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) found that 65% of Indians, or 750 million people, lived on less than 20 rupees per day [ 119 ]  with most working in ""informal labour sector with no job or social security, living in abject poverty."" [ 120 ]   Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under  planning , to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. All these programmes have relied upon the strategies of the  Food for work  programme and  National Rural Employment Programme  of the 1980s, which attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. [ 77 ]  In August 2005, the  Indian parliament  passed the  Rural Employment Guarantee Bill , the largest programme of this type in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of  India's 600 districts . The question of whether economic reforms have reduced poverty or not has fuelled debates without generating any clear cut answers and has also put political pressure on further economic reforms, especially those involving the downsizing of labour and cutting agricultural subsidies. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]     [ edit ]   Education   Further information:  Education in India          Boys seated in school near  Baroda ,  Gujarat .       Fewer than 40 percent of adolescents in India attend secondary schools. [ 123 ]  Only 16% of manufacturers in India offer in-service training to their employees, compared with over 90% in China. [ 124 ]  Overall, one estimate is that only one in five job-seekers in India has ever had any sort of  vocational training . [ 9 ]   Among developing countries, India stands out for its spectacularly low levels of occupational and geographic mobility. [ 125 ]     [ edit ]   Employment   Agricultural and allied sectors accounted for about 57% of the total workforce in 19992000, down from 60% in 199394. While agriculture has faced stagnation in growth, services have seen a steady growth. Of the total workforce, 8% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in the public sector. The NSSO survey estimated that in 19992000, 106 million, nearly 10% of the population were unemployed and the overall unemployment rate was 7.32%, with rural areas doing marginally better (7.21%) than urban areas (7.65%). India's labor force is growing by 2.5% every year, but employment is growing only at 2.3% a year. [ 126 ]   Unemployment in India is characterized by chronic  underemployment  or  disguised unemployment . Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and unemployment (which in recent decades has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods) attempt to solve the problem, by providing financial assistance for setting up businesses, skill honing, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decreased role of the public sector after liberalization has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and has also put political pressure on further reforms. [ 127 ] [ 77 ]   In 2006,  remittances  from Indian migrants overseas made up $27 billion or about 3% of India's GDP.

The economic reforms of 1991 reduced the  red tape , bureaucracy and the  Licence Raj  that had strangled private enterprise and was blamed for the corruption and inefficiencies. Yet, a 2005 study by  Transparency International  (TI) India found that more than half of those surveyed had firsthand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office. [ 129 ]   The  Right to Information Act  (2005) and equivalent acts in the states, that require government officials to furnish information requested by citizens or face punitive action, computerisation of services and various central and state government acts that established vigilance commissions have considerably reduced corruption or at least have opened up avenues to redress grievances. [ 129 ]  The 2007 report by Transparency International ranks India at 72nd place and states that significant improvements were made by India in reducing corruption. [ 130 ] [ 131 ]     [ edit ]   Regional imbalance     See also:  States of India by size of economy  and  List of regions of India            A rural man drying  cow dung  in  Bihar , the poorest state in India.       One of the critical problems facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India's different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development. [ 132 ]  Seven low-income states -  Bihar ,  Chhattisgarh ,  Jharkhand ,  Madhya Pradesh ,  Orissa ,  Rajasthan , and  Uttar Pradesh  - are home to more than half of India's population. [ 124 ]   Between 1999 and 2008, the annualized growth rates for  Gujarat  (8.8%),  Haryana  (8.7%), or  Delhi  (7.4%) were much higher than for  Bihar  (5.1%),  Uttar Pradesh  (4.4%), or  Madhya Pradesh  (3.5%). [ 133 ]   Poverty rates in rural  Orissa  (43%) and rural  Bihar  (40%) are some of the worst in the world. [ 100 ]  On the other hand, rural  Haryana  (5.7%) and rural  Punjab  (2.4%) compare well with middle-income countries. [ 100 ]   The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities [ 134 ]  After liberalization, the more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors. [ 135 ] [ 136 ]       Lagging states need to bring more jobs to their people by creating an attractive investment destination. Reforming cumbersome regulatory procedures, improving rural connectivity, establishing law and order, creating a stable platform for natural resource investment that balances business interests with social concerns, and providing rural finance are important.

On Yale and Columbia's  Environmental Performance Index , India's score is 21/100 on sanitation, compared with 67/100 for the region and 48/100 for the country income group. [ 137 ]   About 1.2 billion people in developing nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. [ 138 ]  Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). [ 139 ]  114 cities dump untreated  sewage  and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. [ 140 ]  Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as other developing countries. NewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred  Yamuna River  as ""a putrid ribbon of black sludge"" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem. [ 137 ]   Cholera  epidemics are not unknown. [ 137 ]  Open  defecation  is widespread even in urban areas of India. [ 141 ] [ 142 ]   Indoor air pollution from burning wood, coal and animal dung is widespread. [ 143 ]  70% of rural households in India lack ventilation. Particulate concentrations in houses are reported to range from 8,300 to 15,000 g/m 3 , greatly exceeding the 75 g/m 3  maximum standard for indoor particulate matter in the United States. [ 144 ]   Changes in ecosystem biological diversity, evolution of parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as  cholera  which emerged in 1992 in India. The frequency of  AIDS / HIV  is increasing. In 1996, about 46,000 Indians out of 2.8 million (1.6 % of the population) tested were found to be infected with HIV. [ 145 ]   Even in the rich regions, health care is poor. World Bank reports that ""a detailed survey of the knowledge of medical practitioners for treating five common conditions in Delhi found that the typical quality doctor in a public primary health center has a more than 50-50 chance of recommending a harmful treatment"". The competence rating of India's doctors is below  Tanzania 's. [ 100 ]     [ edit ]   External trade and investment     [ edit ]   Global trade relations          Indian exports in 2006              According to the CIA Factbook (2007), India is a net importer. Total imports stood at US$224 billion and exports were US$140 billion. Shown here is the cargo of a container ship being unloaded at the  Jawaharlal Nehru Port ,  Navi Mumbai       International trade  as a proportion of GDP reached 24% by 2006, up from 6% in 1985 and still relatively moderate. [ 5 ] [ 146 ]   India currently accounts for 1.2% of World trade as of 2006 according to the WTO. [ 147 ]  Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledging economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while  foreign direct investment  was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200M annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of  non-resident Indians . [ 148 ]   India's exports were stagnant for the first 15 years after independence, due to the predominance of tea, jute and  cotton  manufactures, demand for which was generally  inelastic . Imports in the same period consisted predominantly of machinery, equipment and raw materials, due to nascent industrialisation. Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade has become more broad-based and has risen to Rs. 63,080,109  crores  in 200304 from Rs.1,250 crores in 195051. [ citation needed ]  India's major trading partners are China, the US, the UAE, the UK, Japan and the EU. [ 149 ]  The exports during April 2007 were $12.31 billion up by 16% and import were $17.68 billion with an increase of 18.06% over the previous year. [ 150 ]   India is a founding-member of  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) since 1947 and its successor, the  World Trade Organization . While participating actively in its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the  developing world . For instance, India has continued its opposition to the inclusion of such matters as labour and environment issues and other  non-tariff barriers  into the WTO policies. [ 151 ]   Despite reducing import restrictions several times in the 2000s, [ 152 ] [ 153 ]  India was evaluated by the World Trade Organization in 2008 as more restrictive than similar developing economies, such as Brazil, China, and Russia. The WTO also identified electricity shortages and inadequate transportation infrastructure as significant constraints on trade.  [ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ]  Its restrictiveness has been cited as a factor which has isolated it from the  global financial crisis of 20082009  more than other countries, even though it has reduced ongoing economic growth. [ 157 ]     [ edit ]   Balance of payments   Since independence, India's  balance of payments  on its  current account  has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India's exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 200203, up from 66.2% in 199091. Although India is still a net importer, since 199697, its overall balance of payments (i.e., including the  capital account  balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from  non-resident Indians ; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings. As a result, India's foreign currency reserves stood at $285 billion in 2008, which could be used in infrastructural development of the country if used effectively.   India's reliance on external assistance and commercial borrowings has decreased since 199192, and since 200203, it has gradually been repaying these debts. Declining interest rates and reduced borrowings decreased India's debt service ratio to 4.5% in 2007. [ 158 ]  In India,  External Commercial Borrowings  (ECBs) are being permitted by the Government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The  Ministry of Finance  monitors and regulates these borrowings (ECBs) through ECB policy guidelines. [ 159 ]     [ edit ]   Investment     Share of top five investing countries in FDI inflows. (20002007) [ 160 ]     Rank   Country   Inflows  (Million USD)   Inflows (%)       1     Mauritius   85,178   44.24% [ 161 ]       2     United States   18,040   9.37%       3     United Kingdom   15,363   7.98%       4     Netherlands   11,177   5.81%       5     Singapore   9,742   5.06%       Foreign direct investment  in India has reached 2% of GDP, compared with 0.1% in 1990, and Indian investment in other countries rose sharply in 2006. [ 5 ]   As the fourth-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India is a preferred destination for  foreign direct investments  (FDI); [ 162 ]  India has strengths in information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and jewellery. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies resulted in a significant hindrance. However, due to some positive economic reforms aimed at deregulating the economy and stimulating foreign investment, India has positioned itself as one of the front-runners of the rapidly growing Asia Pacific Region. [ 162 ]  India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 50 million and represents a growing consumer market. [ 163 ]   India's recently liberalized FDI policy (2005) allows up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and foreign direct investment FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalized FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100 per cent FDI in the construction business. [ 164 ]  This automatic route has been permitted in townships, housing, built-up infrastructure and construction development projects including housing, commercial premises, hotels, resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.   A number of changes were approved on the FDI policy to remove the caps in most sectors. Fields which require relaxation in FDI restrictions include civil aviation, construction development, industrial parks, petroleum and natural gas, commodity exchanges, credit-information services and mining. But this still leaves an unfinished agenda of permitting greater foreign investment in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing. FDI inflows into India reached a record US$19.5bn in fiscal year 2006/07 (April-March), according to the government's Secretariat for Industrial Assistance. This was more than double the total of US$7.8bn in the previous fiscal year. The FDI inflow for 2007-08 has been reported as $24bn [ 165 ]  and for 2008-09, it is expected to be above $35 billion. [ 166 ]  A critical factor in determining India's continued economic growth and realizing the potential to be an economic superpower is going to depend on how the government can create incentives for FDI flow across a large number of sectors in India.
