A day to remember all they have given us,  each day, and throughout every year.  When I think about you on this day,  my heart misses you so very much.  I miss the love only a Mother can give,  with her gentle, and caring touch.  But I do know that even in Heaven,  God remembers the Mothers He called home.  And He will bless you for all you gave,  before returning to the kingdom of His throne.  So as you celebrate Mother's Day in Heaven,  know you are loved by your children this day.  As the love for a mother is a very special love,  which nothing, or time, can ever take away.  Yet I don't need Mother's Day to remind me,  of all the love I hold so deeply in my heart.  Not a day has past when I don't think of you,  since the Angels came, and we had to part.  Today I am sending my love up to Heaven,  to you my precious Mother, on Angels' wings.  And I give thanks for everything you gave me,  as a Mother's love is one of life's true blessings.

Author Unknown        ""A  Child's  Love""    You have given to me the precious gift of life,  and a wonderful place for me to call my home.  But most of all, you have freely given to me,  the greatest unconditional love, I've ever known.  I feel blessed having been born out of your love;  for you wanting me, without knowing who I'd be.  And now you know who I am, not a day has past,  when I have ever felt that you did not want me.  Without me ever needing to ask for it from you,  you've always been right here for me over the years.  Sharing in so many smiles, as you have felt my joy,  and comforting me in sorrow, wiping away my tears.  You have taught me so much over the many years;  some I was too young to remember, but lots I do.  But those not remembered, are still part of me,  and I've become who I am today, because of you.  Although I am ""my own person"", an individual,  I'm thankful that so much of you lives inside me.  If I'd been able to choose my own personality traits,  it would have been yours, that I wanted them to be.  I just want you to know how much I do love you,  and have appreciated everything you have ever done.  I could not have asked for a more special parent,  as in my heart, you will forever be,  my number ONE!

Teach me to understand my children,  to listen patiently to what they have to say,  and to answer all their questions kindly.  Keep me from interrupting them or contradicting them.  Make me as courteous to them as I would have them be to me.  Forbid that I should ever laugh at their mistakes,  or resort to shame or ridicule when they displease me.  May I never punish them for my own selfish  satisfaction or to show my power.  Let me not tempt my child to lie or steal.  And guide me hour by hour that I may demonstrate by all  I say and do that honesty produces happiness.  Reduce, I pray, the meanness in me.  And when I am out of sorts, help me, O Lord, to hold my tongue.  May I be ever mindful that my children are children  and I should not expect of them the judgment of adults.  Let me not rob them of the opportunity to wait  on themselves and to make decisions.  Bless me with the bigness to grant them all their reasonable requests,  and the courage to deny them privileges I know will do them harm.  Make me fair and just and kind.  And make me fit, O Lord, to be loved  and respected and imitated by my children.  AMEN  Author Unknown         A Song From Heaven    In the last months of my Mothers life, she would slip in  and out of a worldnown only to her.  When she was in ""Her World"", we would all try to reach her,  to try and draw her back to us. But we had no control.  So we lived for the clear days, when she was in ""Our World"".  On one of those clear days, Mother drew me to her  bedside, and lookingnto my face she said,  "" Mum came to me yesterday.""  I can tell you I was not prepared for the words my Mother  spoke,ut as she told me of the visit, I listened,  daring not to speak. ""Mum was trying to teach me  something,"" she said, "" It was like a dream,ut more real.  I understood clearly what she was saying.""BR>  Mother paused, then looked deeply into my eyes.  ""Mum sang an old songhat she used to sing while she went  about her work in theitchen. I had forgotten that song.  I wish I had the words.""  I caught my breath and asked her the name of the song.  She didn't knowhe name, but she sang me the chorus,  struggling to recall the words.  "" Far away, beyond the starry night,"" my Mother sang.  I sensed themportance of the song and hung on every word.  Before I lefthat day, I promised to look for the words.  I looked everywhere, but not knowing the title and it  being suchn old song, I didn't have any luck.  My Mother's birthday was fast approaching, and I knew  that this songould be the perfect gift. I had all  but given up, when one day, as Ias listening to a  ""talk radio "" show, I decided to appeal to the goodBR> people in Arkansas. I called in and told them about my Mother'sBR> desire and I gave them what I had of the song.  Before the afternoon was done, I not only had the words  to Mother's song, had the music and a tape.  The folks that made the tape for me, filled the rest of  the tape with songs about Mothers. And not one ofhose  beautiful people would take a dime for the time spent.  Oh what a birthday that was. I popped that tape into  Mother's playernd watched, as her face flooded  with tears of joy. Mother played thatong so much,  that before long, we both had it committed to memory.  Little did I know what an important roll that song  wouldlay in months to come.  Soon, Mother slipped into ""Her World"", and nothing we  could doould draw her back to ours. We knew the end was near.  Before her health failed, Mother had crocheted everyone a  beautifulfghan, except for my younger sister.  I recall her asking me what colourshe should make Donna's  afghan. I told her I would find out, but whenother  became ill, we all forgot about the afghan...  all that is,xcept Mother.  There in her hospital bed, away in her world, she  would sit for hours,orking in a strained position  on an imaginary afghan. I tried inain to pull her  back to us. I would beg her to lay down her ""yarn""  and rest,ut she would take on that determined look  that I knew so well,ull away and continue working.  One day, as I watched her work with her imaginary yarn,  I decided to go to Mother instead of trying to pull her  back to me. admired her afghan and the pretty colours.  She smiled!She had ""Heard"" me.  I asked her who the afghan was for, and in broken speech  she said,My girl."" I promised her that when she finished,  I would see that Donna got that beautiful afghan.  Then I started to sing her song.  ""Twilight is stealing over the sea.""  An amazing thing happened. Mother stopped her crocheting  and egan to sing. She only hit every other word or so,  but oh those words ere precious to me. As I started  to sing the chorus, became aware of a bird singing  outside the window. walked to the window as I sang,  and there, perched on theement ledge of the 4th floor  window, was a red and brown finch,inging his heart out!  What a sight we were that day. Mother and I andhat  little bird,inging at the top of our lungs!  One month latter, I was listening to the  tape at my Mother's funeral.  nd I could almost hear her... singing along.  I will always believe that God sent me and Mother  that song.As for that little bird... well...  he must have been an Angel... sento put a song  in our hearts at a time when we needed it the most.  Bobby Smith        ""A  Mothers  Love""    l have watched you grow up over the years,  and shared in the learning, the joys and the tears.  l've seen you become the person who you are today,  A child of mine, and so very special to me, in every way.

Your hands love without end,  Gently tend the fevered brow,  until the morning comes again.  No other hands will ever feel  the same as a mother's touch,  No others hands love truer,  none could ever care so much.  Your hands will show the way  on the wings of mother's prayers,  They'll find the grace to grow each day.  Your hands love faithfully,  They're a picture of the love  of God and Jesus, they can see.  Written by  -  Lisa JohnsonBR>         A Touch of Love    You were six months old and full of fun,  With the blink of an eye, you were suddenly one.  There were so many things we were going to do,  But I turned my head, and you turned two.  At two you were very dependent on me,  But independence took over when you turned three.  Your third birthday, another year I tried to ignore.  But when I lit the candles there weren't three, but four.  Four was the year that you really strived,  Why, look at you now, you're already five.  Now you are ready for books and for rules.  This is the year that you go to school.  The big day came, you were anxious to go.  We walked to the bus, going oh, so slow.  As you climbed aboard and waved goodbye,  I felt a lump in my throat and tears stung my eyes.  Time goes so fast, it's hard to believe  That just yesterday you were home here with me.  And tomorrow when the bus brings you home  and you jump to the ground,  You'll be wearing your cap and graduation gown.  So, I'm holding to these moments as hard as I can,  Because the next time I look, I'll be seeing a man.  Author Unknown         Walking With Grandma    I like to walk with Grandma,  Her steps are short like mine.  She doesn't say ""Now hurry up.""  She always takes her time.  I like to walk with Grandma,  Her eyes see things like mine do...  Wee pebbles bright, a funny cloud,  Half hidden drops of dew.  Most people have to hurry,  They do not stop and see...  I'm glad that God made Grandma,  Unrushed and young like me!  Author Unknown         No Charge    My little boy came into the kitchen this evening  while I was fixing supper.  And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on.  So, after wiping my hands on my apron, I read it,  and this is what it said:   For mowing the grass, $5.  For making my own bed this week, $1.  For going to the store $.50.  For playing with baby brother while you  went shopping, $.25.  For taking out the trash, $1.  For getting a good report card, $5.  And for raking the yard, $2.   Well, I looked at him standing there expectantly,  and a thousand memories flashed through my mind.  So, I picked up the paper, and turning it over,  this is what I wrote:   For the nine months I carried you,rowing  inside me, No Charge.  For the nights I sat up with you,octored you  prayed for you, No charge.  For the time and the tears,nd the cost  through the years, No Charge.  For the nights filled with dread,nd the  worries ahead, No Charge.  For advice and the knowledge,nd the cost of  your college, No Charge.  For the toys, food and clothes,nd for  wiping your nose, No Charge.  Son, when you add it all up,he full cost  of my love is No Charge.   Well, when he finished reading, he had greatBR> big tears in his eyes.  And he looked up at me and he said,  ""Mama, I sure do love you.""BR> Then he took the pen and in great big letters he wrote,  ""Paid In Full""  Written by - Shirley Caesar  These words were put to music, one of my all time favourite songs.      When God Created Mothers    When the good Lord was creating mothers, He was into  His sixth day of overtime, when an angel appeared and said,   ""You're doing a lot of fiddling around on this one.  "" And the Lord said, ""Have you read the spec on this one?  She has to be completely washable, but not plastic;  have 180 moveable parts, all replaceable; run on  black coffee and leftovers; have a lap that disappears  when she stands up; A kiss that can cure anything from  a broken leg to a disappointed love affair; and six pair of hands.""  The angel shook her head slowly and said,  ""Six pairs of hands...no way.  It's not the hands that are causing me problems,""  said the Lord.  ""It's the three pairs of eyes that  Mothers have to have.""  ""That's on the standard model?"" asked the angel.  The Lord nodded. ""One pair that sees through closed doors  when she asks, ""What are you kids doing in there?""  when she already knows. Another here, in the back  of her head that sees what she shouldn't, but  what she has to know, and of course the ones here  in front that can look at a child when he goofs up  and say, ""I understand and I love you,"" without  so much as uttering a word.""  ""Lord,"" said the angel, touching his sleeve gently,  ""Rest for now. Tomorrow.....""  ""I can't,"" said the Lord. ""I'm so close to creating  something close to myself. Already I have one who  heals herself when she is sick, can feed a family  of six on one kilo of hamburger mince and can  get a nine year old to stand under a shower.  The angel circled the model of the Mother very slowly.  ""She's too soft,"" she sighed.  ""But tough!"" said the Lord excitedly.  ""You cannot imagine what the mother can do or endure.  ""Can she think?""  ""Not only think, but she can reason and compromise,""  said the Creator.  Finally the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek.  ""There's a leak,"" she pronounced. ""I told you, you were  trying to put too much into this model.""  ""It's not a leak,"" said the Lord. ""It's a tear.""  ""What's it for?""  ""It's for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain,  loneliness and pride.""  ""You're a genius,"" said the angel.  The Lord looked sombre, ""I didn't put it there.""

Walker was the daughter of slaves, married at 14, a widow with a baby daughter at 20. But, by the time that she was 40, Madam C. J. Walker (1867-1919) was making as much money as a white corporate executive, thanks to her popular hair-care products for black women and her brilliance at marketing them. She created a workforce of sales agents that gave African American women job options other than being washerwomen or domestics. As her prominence and wealth increased, she became a generous benefactor of black educational institutions, and such a staunch supporter of the anti-lynching movement that the State Department labeled her a ""race agitator"" and denied her a passport in 1919. Yet, she had plenty of time for fun, too; she built a lavish mansion (near John D. Rockefeller's) in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, and her daughter Lelia entertained the Harlem Renaissance elite in a spectacular Manhattan townhouse that was renovated with revenues from the company's New York branch. Madam C. J. Walker as she chose to call herself after marrying Charles J. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove in 1867 to former slaves. She was orphaned at age 7 when her parents died in a yellow fever epidemic. As a child she picked cotton and helped do laundry for others. After the death of her parents she lived with her sister and brother-in-law, Willie. At 14 she married Moses McWilliams ""to get a home of my own."" Three years later she had a baby girl, Lelia, and two years later she was widowed. She was a very driven person who wanted to provide well for herself and young daughter. As a child she had never been educated, so she worked during the day and went to school at night. She even saved enough money to send her daughter to college. All this before she founded her company. But it was a difficult time for blacks and it wasnât until Sarah had a dream in which a man gave her a secret formula for a hair care product that her life began to change for the better. Sarah had been experiencing hair loss herself and decided to try the formula. She found it worked wonderfully and tried it on family and friends. Everyone loved it. She began mixing her new product, Wonderful Hair Grower, in an attic and selling it door-to-door. Eventually she opened her own factory. Her daughter managed the company and Madame Walker traveled promoting and demonstrating her products.  Madam Walker had always wanted to help others and now she had the money to do so. Her employees, mostly black women, received better pay and were treated with dignity and offered opportunities for advancement. She gave money to Mary Bethuneâs school, the NAACP, many black writers and artists, churches, YMCAâs, and various charities.   At only 51 years of age, on May 25, 1919, Madam C. J.

As America's ""Family Manager,"" bestselling author Kathy Peel has shown millions of moms that running a household is like operating a business. Like any good C.E.O., every mother must know her goals, determine her strategies, and manage her human resources.       Delegate-Motivate-Organize...Relax!       Every smart manager knows that success depends on teamwork. Kathy shows readers how to get kids and spouses to help around the house-with lots of practical advice and encouragement to get them motivated and keep them going.       Save Time, Money, and Your Sanity      With hundreds of time-saving, money-saving, and stress-reducing ideas, this indispensable handbook also shows readers how to take charge of running the home-without running themselves into the ground.                                                                                                                 ,                                                          s                                           p: 10       sGU:                                :  WiseMomma  CT, USA - 2008t75           HomeManager101           Upon leaving the corporate world to nurture our first born, I came across this book. It was a very helpful tool! It gave me help I needed to transition rolls from Corp Woman to Family Manager. It helped me see myself in a new light. The term HomeMaker is so matronly and out dated. With my new title as Home Manager and new job description I was ready to tackle the days ahead with confidence. This book gives sooo much practical advice. It's like having a granny sharing all her secretes and golden nuggets to keeping a house in order all the while balancing the delicate relationships of wife, mother and friend. Written well, organized chapters by subject, meaty & written in plain english with no unnecessary fluff. It is a wonderful book and I'm so glad I got my hands on it! More than a good read, it has templates and loads of suggestive advise to getting the job done efficiently and quickly. The Family Manager Takes Charge is a must have for those seeking more sanity while running the home.                                   :  Mommie of Mollie  San Antonio, TX - 2007t87           Things I never thought to do (or never knew how)           I just got this book a few days ago, and have been reading it in my spare time, but already I've organized the office, my daughter's closet, and the kitchen cupboards with Kathy Peel's advice.  This book not only gives great tips and advice, but gets you motivated to keep a clean, organized and orderly home.  I'm only in the 4th or 5th chapter so far, and have gotten so many great ideas for keeping a more smooth-running home.  My husband has really enjoyed coming home every day to a more organized, neater home.  Our biggest problem is clutter, and she gives great advice for getting rid of clutter and controlling the influx.  We have a lot to do yet, but I'm excited to take back our home with Kathy Peel's helpful instructions.                                   :  KJK  boulder, co - 2007t410           A must for new brides!           I have been a housewife for 17 years and I still learned a lot of great time saving tips from this book.  This is definately the kind fo book you have to buy, not borrow, so you can hilight and tag pages that jump out at you.  It has columns for notes, budgets, etc.  This is an absolutely perfect book for a shower gift or anniversary gift for a new bride--I am excited to give a copy to my daughters when they leave home.                                   :  Rivka Slatkin  None - 2007t211           not the typical organizing book           A lot of organizing books repeat the same old principles. Kathy's book applies an entirely different creed! Family managers become CEOs of the family which gives us a whole different perspective and value system. I highly recommend this book. Even after you get the concept down, there is a lot of information in the book you will want to have on the shelf as a reference.                                   :  Coleen A.

All family members living in the home should help take care of the home they live in. Almost everyone can do something, even small children. There is NO reason why Mom should clean up behind herself and everyone else too! After all, if everyone is partaking of the blessings of the home to live in, everyone should help take care of it. While no one will change overnight, incorporating these tips into your daily life will soon make new and neater habits for even the messiest of the messies. If you make a mess, clean it up immediately. Don't say you will get it after a while, do it now. Once you walk away from it, chances are that you won't go back to it. Make a habit of cleaning up as you go! This saves time and keeps the home clean and organized. Washing dishes as you cook works great if you don't want a pile after the meal, fold and put away the laundry as soon as it's done, and have the kids put away toys they are done with before they take more out. If you use it, put it back where it belongs. Don't wait until later, do it immediately! Again, once you leave it, chances are you won't go back to it, and whatever you used will not be put away. Have family members learn to put things where they belong when they are done with the item.

You can set your own hours, work when you want to, be with the kids more, and you are your own boss. The perks are wonderful. But having a home business can also become overwhelming quickly when it comes to balancing work and caring for the home and family. It's important for a WAHM to be organized so that the home business and the home and family are taken care of. Being organized doesn't mean you have to do everything yourself. Enlist the rest of the family to help out. Instead of trying to run your home business and do everything around the house that needs to be done, delegate chores out to the rest of the family. This can either be done on a rotating basis where the chores change each week, or you can assign certain chores to family members that they will be responsible for on a daily or weekly basis. Almost everyone can do something. In assigning chores to be done, it's helpful to remember that the kids and hubby will no doubt not do things the way you do them. Unless something is really needing taken care of better or in a different manner, don't go behind them and redo it or complain to them. The idea is to get help so that you can work. If you go behind them, you're not getting work done.

If our homes are disorganized and cluttered, it can easily overwhelm us. Activities as simple as looking for something, trying to decide where to start cleaning, or even where to store something can overwhelm us causes unnecessary stress. Decluttering and organizing the home isn't difficult and it makes day to day life so much simpler. When you get organized, you not only have an organized home and a clutter free home, but you have better time management. This gives you more time to do things you want to do or need to do, not to mention the benefits of less stress on the mind and body. One of the first steps to getting an organized life is to declutter your home. Uncluttering the home gets rid of things that you no longer need or use. This can be clothes that you or the family no longer wear or fit into, books and toys the kids have outgrown, things that you keep that serve no purpose, papers ad magazines that have piled up over the months, etc. It it serves no useful purpose and isn't being kept for sentimental purposes, it's probably a good idea to toss it out. Once the clutter is gone, then you can begin to organize your home room by room. Everyone has a different idea of how to organize their home and belongings. The best way is to organize for how you use things. Items that you use the most obviously need to be more accessible than items that are used less often. So you will want to organize used items in a manner that they can be easily obtained when needed.

thinking back to a time when I was young,            My memory is clear as day, I'm listening to the dishes clink,            You were downstairs; you would sing songs of praise,            And all the times we laughed with you,            And all the times that you stayed true to us,            Now we say, I said, I thank you,            I'll always thank you,            More than you could know,            Than I could ever show,            And I love you, I'll always love you,            There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,            That you're beautiful forever,            You were my mom,            You were my dad,            The only thing I ever had was you, It's true,            And even when the times got hard you were there,            To let us know that we'd get through, you showed me how to be a man,            You taught me how to understand the things people do,            You showed me how to love my God,            You taught me that not everyone knows the truth,            And I thank you,            I'll always thank you,            More than you could know,            Than I could ever show,            And I love you, I'll always love you,            There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,            That you will live forever, always                                                                                I Want a Mom           (Album: Unknown; Artist: Cyndi Lauper)                       I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom who love me whatever                      I want a mom to take my hand           And make me feel like a holiday           A mom to tuck me in at night           And chase the monsters away           I         want a mom to read me stories           And sing a lullaby           And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Oh, I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom that will love me whatever, forever                      And when she says to me that she'll always be there           To watch and protect me, I don't have to be scared           O, and when she says I will always love you,            I don't need to worry cause I'll know that it's true                      I want a mom when I get lonely, to take the time to play           A mom who can be a friend and find a rainbow when it gray           I want a mom to read me stories and sing a lullaby           And if I find a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Chorus (repeat twice):            I want a mom           I want a mom           I

Literally jumped off the page and said âread me.â Perhaps it is because I have a home office that looks like this:     Iâve tried to organize it before as you can probably see from the various boxes on the shelves, but for some reason it just didnât stick. What? It doesnât look too bad, you say? Well, thatâs because I havenât shown you the close-up view. Prepare yourself, it gets pretty bad.   Iâll start with the shelves - nothing unbearable there really. Itâs not completely organized, but at least you can see the labels on everything and theyâre easily accessible. The only problem is that there are several of these stacks lying around with no real order to them.     Okay, moving on to the other side of the desk. Here we have my perpectually over-flowing inbox. Itâs full of the papers that I can never find and that I never know what to do with once theyâre found.     And now, the other side of the desk(I saved the best for last). Consider yourself warned.     Iâm not sure how to even explain it or justify it. Especially the dog hair. Itâs embarrassing really.   This is what Iâve been living with for the past several months. So when I opened the  YOU CAN DO IT book  and saw the Getting Organized chapter heading, I realized that it was written for me and me alone.   Okay, on the off-chance that it was written for you too, Iâm going to show you what it suggests. First, let me say that this chapter is based on the advice of Meryl Starr, a professional organizer in New York. And I like how she said, âorganization doesnât just look good, it feels good.â How true!    Step 1:   Select the space you want to clean. It can be a closet, an entire room, or a cabinet. Make sure that you have an appropriate amount of time to devote to the project and that it can be done within that time frame.    For obvious reasons, I chose my office space. Itâs actually part of the den and sits in between theTV and my husbandâs computer desk. Since we live in a small house, we have to make do with the limited space we have. The shelving system is called  Elfa  and was purchased from  The Container Store  earlier this year. Itâs a great system and very easy to put in place.   Step 2:   Have your supplies that youâll need such as garbage bags and things with which to clean. Meryl suggests that you donât run out and buy a lot of cute boxes and things until you know exactly what you need.    Step 3:   Remove everything from the space that you are organizing and then clean. I took this step very literally and removed everything from my desk and shelves (except for the computer) and then dumped it onto the floor.     Then I cleaned. I mean I scrubbed those shelves until they shined.     I almost didnât want to put anything back and I probably wouldnât have either, but the CPA said I couldnât leave mypile on the floor.   Step 4:   Separate your  mess  stuff into three stacks: 1) stuff to keep, 2) stuff to donate, and 3) stuff to throw away. The object is to keep only those things that you need and to get rid of everything else. Meryl even includes a little pep talk about why it isnât necessary to keep the shell you found while walking on the beach with your first boyfriend. She said that, âyou can hang onto the memory of your first love â¦ without hanging onto the physical memories.â    So I sorted and I separated and finally came up with my three piles.   Throw away:   Donate:   Keep:         Step 5:   Now it wastime to put everything back.  Things had been pretty easy until this point but suddenly I broke out in a cold sweat. I had been down this road before and was scared to try it again. I mean, being organized isnât a thing that comes naturally for me, I have to work at it. Hard. Just as I began to wonder if it was worth the effort and maybe I should just accept a life of slothfulness, I started to get ideas in my head. Mental images of what my desk could look like.   So I ran upstairs and grabbed the tv/monitor that was sitting unused in the guest room. I hooked it up beside my computer so that it could act as my second monitor, one to be used just for working on photos. Then I followed some of Merylâs suggestions to take advantage of organizational toolssuch as divider trays, boxes for cds or photos, baskets, hooks, etc.   So I filed away the extra magazinesâ¦     and then rearranged my boxes.     I even made sure they had labels on them to help find things quickly.     I changed the layout of my books which helped to make the stacks look neater and to keepthem from constantly falling over, which was a problem I had struggled with before.     Then I made a quick trip to The Container Store for some drawers as I previously did not have any in place. I think that is the key to keeping my desk organized - having a space for the little things to go. SotheCPA and Iinstalled the three  new drawers  (which are currently on sale for half off, btw).     In the bottom drawer I stored my collection of stationery. (Some people collect stamps, others collect coins. I collect paper products.)     In the next drawer, we added an insert that provides individual spaces for things like post-it notes, pens, and chapstick.     And the top drawer is the place for my miscellaneous papers. Only this time, I have a system to use. I put in three separate containers to help keep my papers from being thrown all over the drawer.     Then, I grabbed some of these fantastic paper clips and wrote titles on them such as âfileâ     âurgent,â     and âmiscellaneous.â     Also while at The Container Store, we had picked up this great  cord organizer . You probably donât realize it, but behind that white âpipeâ is about four different cords. The idea is to try to hide them as much as possible since they can look very unsightly. Iâm still working on hiding the other cords, but itâs a start.     A few finishing touches such as the clock,     and this floating shelf (to be used for the books I am currently reading) and voila. We were done!     And now for the end result of all of our hard workâ¦     Isnât that amazing? With all the extra space that was created, I even had a place for my new scanner.    Hereâs the breakdown:   Before: After:       Before: After:      Before: After:      There you have it. Was it a lot of work? I wonât lie to you - it took me several hours, the better part of a day really.   Was it worth it?   Hmmâ¦ to go from this:     to this:     ABSOLUTELY!!   Okay, now that youâre all fired-up and ready to get going, what space are you going to organize? Do you have any suggestions or tips that work for you?

Seriously amazing. I canât wait to see it in person. It looks so great. Good job. I know that must have taken forever!                                    The Wife of Odie  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 7:32 am         P.S. $20 if youâll come do that at my house                                     Margie  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 8:11 am         Awesome. Looks so professional now. Great job.                                    Joanna  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 9:24 am         That is inspiring!!  Iâll be honest, I LOVE organizing.  One of the things I miss about being child-free is being able to tackle a project like that and not be constantly interrupted.  Iâm a huge nerd, itâs true.   I also collect stationery.  Because Iâm cool like that.                                    Kristina  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 9:24 am         First of all, I need a desk system like that. And secondly, it looks amazing! It could be in the Ikea catalog!                                    Ruth  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 11:13 am         Ahhh, the wonders and pains of organizing! Since I am a homemaker now, I should be good at itâ¦ right?  My fiancee/husband is an amazing organizer. Sometimes I can get him to help me figure a space out, then I just have to keep it that way.   I LOVE stationary too!! I love making it, finding cool and on sale stuff to buy, and using it for letters!  PS You did an amazing job!!                                    admin  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 12:29 pm         WofO- make it $50 and youâve got a deal!      Margie - why, thank you!   Joanna - I can imagine it would be hard to finish a project with little ones taking your attention.    Kristina - funny you should mention Ikea since all of the boxes were there (they look similar to the Container Store boxes but are only a fraction of the cost).  Also - the Elfa system itself, which we bought during their sale, was less than $300.00.     Ruth - a fellow stationery lover!!  Isnât it the best?  I went into a store recently thatâs going out of business and they had their Crane paper on sale for 50% off (which, as you know, never happens).  I had to stop myself at five.                                    Courtney  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 1:49 pm         Looks GREAT!  Very impressive!                                    Melody C.  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 3:52 am         Oh, my office needs this kind of help. In my defense, I need shelves and a file cabinet of my own, not shared. In an attempt to kick start my clean up I invited my husband to move his desk into my office. Now his side of the room is VERY clean and my piles are now just taller as piles consolidated to make room. Iâm sure I will sort and organize at some point, but the real organization wonât occur until (1) I start a new job with an office away from home, and (2) I get back to the States where I can splurge in places like the Container Store!    Thanks for showing that you donât have to be Martha Stewart to actually accomplish this task!!!                                    Melody C.  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 3:53 am         upon reading your comments closer, I see you had success at Ikea. We have an Ikea not too far away (special trip, not a weekly distance!) I see an excursion in my future!!!                                    Jim @ Change Jar Savings  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 6:46 am         Great job in organizing.   The problem that most people have is they want to hold on to too much stuff. Then it becomes overwhelming to think about getting rid of something you âcherishâ. We also tend to buy more than we should.                                    Rona  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 7:50 am         wow. thatâs all i have to say. this is truly inspiring - makes me wanna tackle that poor excuse of a work area weâve got.  love the color scheme btw.                                    admin  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 10:53 am         Thanks Courtney!    Melody - ha ha, no Martha Stewart here!  Thatâs why I needed a book to help me.   And yes, IKEA is definitely the place to go!   Jim - I agree, thatâs the hardest part sometimes, throwing away things weâre attached to.   Rona - Good luck with your work area - you can do it!!                                    Mary  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 10:56 am         Oh my goodness - this looks fabulous and really looks so inviting.  What would be a good enough incentive for you to do that say in my office, craft room, kitchen????  Remember, Iâm on a limited budget hereâ¦..   Your list of âhow-toâ is great and Iâll definitely print in order to remind myself of what I need to do when I tackle my jobs.  Iâll have to be couragous and send you pics of my finished project to get your opinion of how successful Iâve been.  I know this took a great deal of time but the end product is amazing.  Well done!!!   M                                    Just Pure Lovely  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 10:31 pm         Yowzee, that looks great!  Itâs right out of the pages of a magazine, isnât it?  Iâd have thought so, anyway, if you hadnât posted photos of the progress.  Way to go!   ~ Lori   p.s. Thanks for visiting my blog earlier this week!                                    erin  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 11:23 pm         Ohhhh I love that clock.   I am SO GLAD your book/organizer says to remove everything from the space you want to clean - I have always done that!!  My mother thinks I am nuts but it works for me.  Itâs so much easier to clean and organize an empty space than trying to work around other things that are already there but may not stay where they are.   I have to clean out/organize the closets in my sewing room and our downstairs guest bedroom - my sewing room will become our babyâs nursery and the sewing room will share with the guest bedroom.  I am not sure how I will fit it all (Iâm a bit of a fabric junkie) but Iâm sure if I create a system - other than âjust throw it in the closet and shut the doorâ - I will be able to manage everything.   Thank you for the inspiration!                                    admin  Says:              January 9th, 2009 at 5:00 am         Hi Mary - I wish I could take credit for the how-to list, itâs a good one, isnât it?   Just Pure Lovely - good to see you - love the photos on your site too!   Erin - how exciting, do you know what colors your going to be using for the nursery?  Youâll have to put up pictures so I can see!                                    Another Deb  Says:              January 11th, 2009 at 4:46 pm         I clicked here from Unclutterer and am so impressed!  The office is beautiful, and not so sterile and milimalistic as a lot of them.  This I can RELATE to!  Good job on the new system and thanks for including all of the photos.  I can never see too many before/after pics!                                    Nina  Says:              January 12th, 2009 at 9:24 am         Looks really great and is inspiring for a âoh, I must keep this article/photo/great book!â-person like me.   One thing I pondered on when reading your text and seeing the pics: One thing I read in Declutter books that certainly holds true for me is: the âMISCâ boxes and files come back to bâ¦ haunt you. They are like the zombies of decluttering.  If you ask decluttering-coaches or time-management coaches they will all point in horror at anything you file âmiscâ. It means it has no home, it has no real âproject nameâ - and it will breed and multiply.   One thing I was shown and that has worked well for me is making hanging manila folders with names for these âmiscâ-thingies. New thing - make a named folder, throw it in. Go through them every few weeks, and after a while you see patterns that can be grouped into (named) boxes. Or things you can throw out with a little time passed. I abhorred these hanging folders before. Now I have an Ikea sideboard that hides two wide drawers with the things and that I can stand next to and use as a worktop, too, for sorting stuff. Works great.

thinking back to a time when I was young,           My memory is clear as day, I'm listening to the dishes clink,           You were downstairs; you would sing songs of praise,           And all the times we laughed with you,           And all the times that you stayed true to us,           Now we say, I said, I thank you,           I'll always thank you,           More than you could know,           Than I could ever show,           And I love you, I'll always love you,           There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,           That you're beautiful forever,           You were my mom,           You were my dad,           The only thing I ever had was you, It's true,           And even when the times got hard you were there,           To let us know that we'd get through, you showed me how to be a man,           You taught me how to understand the things people do,           You showed me how to love my God,           You taught me that not everyone knows the truth,           And I thank you,           I'll always thank you,           More than you could know,           Than I could ever show,           And I love you, I'll always love you,           There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,           That you will live forever, always                                                                                I Want a Mom           (Album: Unknown; Artist: Cyndi Lauper)                      I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom who love me whatever                      I want a mom to take my hand           And make me feel like a holiday           A mom to tuck me in at night           And chase the monsters away           I want a mom to read me stories           And sing a lullaby           And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Oh, I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom that will love me whatever, forever                      And when she says to me that she'll always be there           To watch and protect me, I don't have to be scared           O, and when she says I will always love you,           I don't need to worry cause I'll know that it's true                      I want a mom when I get lonely, to take the time to play           A mom who can be a friend and find a rainbow when it gray           I want a mom to read me stories and sing a lullaby           And if I find a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Chorus (repeat twice):           I want a mom           I want a mom           I want a mom that will last forever           I

Many songs around on love it's true,           But here's one just for you.           A faithful lass and one so nice,           From what I've seen only one vice,                      Her wee ones and her husband that's me,           The one vice in a girl so lovely.           A head turner still is she,           All her men as proud as can be.                      So Mum on the day to remember,           On you we all concur,           That indeed you are are the sum,           Of the formula that makes you the No. One Mum!

Madam C.J. Walker                First African-American Female Millionaire                1867-1919               Â                Â                                Madam C.J. Walker was a highly successful entrepreneur of the early                twentieth century and was also well known as a social activist and                philanthropist. Besides being noted as the first female African-American                millionaire, Madam Walker was renowned for her stirring political                and social advocacy and her humanitarian efforts. An early promoter                of womenâs economic independence, she provided well-paying                jobs for thousands of African-American women who otherwise would                have been employed as domestic help and manual laborers.                               Madam C.J. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove on December 23, 1867                to Minerva and Owen Breedlove on the shores of the Mississippi River                in Delta, Louisiana. Her parents were ex-slaves living on the Burney                plantation in Delta and Sarah was the first child of their born                in freedom. As a child, Sarah suffered much loss. Her mother died                when she was only seven years old and though her father remarried                rather quickly he also died before she turned eight. Because her                family was poor, her educational opportunities were limited and                she received little formal education.                               When she was a mere fourteen years old, Sarah married Moses McWilliams                so that she might have a home. Making their home in Vicksburg, together                they had one daughter, AâLelia who was born in 1885. Moses                died in 1887, leaving the widowed Sarah to provide for her family.                She moved with her daughter to St. Louis, Missouri. For the next                eighteen years Sarah supported herself and her daughter by obtaining                work as a washerwoman.                               In 1905, while still living in St. Louis, Sarah had an idea to                begin a cosmetics business. She began to develop a hair care and                grooming system for African-American women that would heal scalp                disease through more frequent shampooing, massage, and an application                of her special ointment. She also devised a method for these women                to straighten their hair. Before this time African-American women                who wanted to de-kink their hair had to iron it with a flat iron                with their hair placed on a flat surface. Sarah devised a system                to straighten hair that used her hair softener with the aid of a                straightening comb.                               Encouraged by her success in St. Louis selling her cosmetics and                method, Sarah moved to Denver Colorado in July, 1905 where she was                joined by her close friend C.J. Walker, a newspaperman. They were                married six months later and though they divorced six years later,                she kept the name that became famous.                                Madam Walker sold her cosmetics and method door-to-door, giving                demonstrations to the women of Denver. She also enlisted the help                of other women hired as agent-operators to sell her products. These                women became known as âhair culturistsâ and âscalp                specialistsâ. Walker required her agents to sign a contract                binding them to a hygienic regimen and in her meetings with them                she stressed the importance of cleanliness and attractiveness as                an aid to self-respect and racial advancement.                                With others selling her method and product for her, Madam Walker                was able to concentrate her efforts on the instruction of her methods                and on the manufacture of her product line. In 1910 she built a                plant in Indianapolis, Indiana that would serve as a center of the                Walker enterprises. The company had many branches including the                Walker College of Hair Culture and Walker Manufacturing Company,                remained in business until it was sold in 1985. The Madame C.J.                Walker Manufacturing Company provided employment for over three                thousand people and Walker herself claimed that her multi-level                sales force had over 20,000 agents by 1919.                               Madam Walker was a generous donor to black charities and was active                in black philanthropic work. In fact, she made the largest single                donation to the National Association of Colored Womenâs effort                to buy the home of Frederick Douglass to be preserved as a museum.                She also contributed generously to such organizations as the Y.M.C.A.                of Indianapolis, the National Association of Colored People and                to several organizations that provided help to the needy in Indianapolis                and scholarships for young men and women at the Tuskegee Institute.                Sarah also encouraged her employees in their own community philanthropic                work, giving cash prizes to the groups of agents that did the largest                amount of community work.                               At the height of her success, Madam Walker was diagnosed with hypertension                and doctors suggested she reduce her activity level. Nevertheless,                Sarah did not heed their advice and continued her busy schedule.                She soon became ill and died on May 25, 1919 as a result of chronic                interstitial nephritis, kidney failure, and hypertension. Despite                her impoverished beginnings, Madam C.J. Walker became known as the                wealthiest African-American woman of her time and, to her credit,                she used her prominent position to fight against racial discrimination                and her substantial fortune to support civic, educational, and social                agencies to aid her fellow African-Americans.

This year, the Academy of American Poets is introducing a new celebration as part of  National Poetry Month â Poem in Your Pocket Day . On  April 17, people across the United States are invited to choose a favorite poem and carry it in their pockets. Just carrying a poem is only part of the celebration though. During the day, poetry lovers are encouraged to unfold and read their pocketed poems in celebration of the visions of poets.    This may be the most challenging day ever  for an English teacher like me. How can I possibly choose just one poem? When I first discussed Poem in Your Pocket Day with colleagues, one of them joked about carrying around a copy of â The Wasteland â in his pocket. I love Eliot too, but Iâd be more likely to carry â Preludes .â Itâs far more portable, but itâs also filled with imagery that I love.     But could I limit it just to â Preludes â? What about my love for the deep allusions in Ezra Poundâs â Hugh Selwyn Mauberly â? Sure everyone knows â In a Station of the Metro ââand there is perhaps no poem more perfectly suited for pocketingâbut my heart belongs to the classical references of âMauberly.â Yet is  that  the right poem?    What about all those  Nikki Giovanni  poems I adore? And how can I forget  Robert Frost  and  Langston Hughes ? Wait, and  Chaucer ,  Shakespeare , and  Blake ? And I have such a nice soft spot for  Christina Rossetti . And I almost forgot about  William Butler Yeats !     Perhaps choosing is just  too  difficult. Maybe I should just write my own, with apologies to  William Carlos Williams :       so much depends    upon               a single       poem          laced with waiting     words                inside my pants     pocket.   Not the work of a great poetic mind, but how can you choose just one anyway? So whatâs your poem? What poet will you carry in your pocket for  Poem in Your Pocket Day ?

These tools provide some great places to start!        Write the  Acrostic Poems  the typical way they are taught, asking students to compose poems that highlight their names or significant nouns. Try the activity with  literature  by having students compose poems for character and place names in a recent reading (e.g., Boo Radley, Maycomb, Atticus Finch). Extend   Acrostic Poems  to content areas by asking students to create acrostics for key vocabulary terms.                 Invite students to publish their poems with the  Stapleless Book . Students might write a series of shorter poems, one on each page of the book. Haiku lend themselves to this strategy. The Stapleless Book can also be used to publish one poem, with a line or two on each page of the book.                  Combine a bit of grammar review with poetry by asking students to compose  Diamante Poems , which use specific parts of speech to contrast different aspects of a single topic or to compare two different topics. The technique can work well in a review of thematic units such as âinnocence to experienceâ or to compare two characters from a work of literature (e.g., Othello and Iago).                 Explore the genre of  Letter Poems  with students and then ask students to use the  Letter Generator  to publish their work. Elementary teachers can use the ReadWriteThink lesson plan  Letter Poems Deliver: Experimenting with Line Breaks in Poetry Writing , which incorporates the online tools.                Describe objects in poems that are published in the object's shape with  Shape Poems . Students can publish poems about Nature, School, Sports, and Celebrations. For example, after a study of the Water Cycle publish shape poems in the shape of the sun, a raindrop, or a cloud.               Have a bit of fun online with Magnetic Poetry  Kids' Kits ,  High School Kit , or  general collections , including a  Shakespeare Kit . Note that some of the general sets will not be appropriate for students (e.g., the Innuendo Kit or the Pickup Lines Kit), so provide students with the direct link to the tools that you choose rather than sending them to the general collections page.

There are cases where teachers and administrators assume that they are exempt, but even the  THE Journal  article suggests that the underlying reasons for the  violations are more complicated. Carol Simpson, who has written a series of books on copyright issues, shares this example in the article:   A school district in Texas purchased a single copy of a high-stakes assessment workbook for each grade level, then sent the copies to the district print shop. The print shop duplicated a copy for each student in the district. The copyright owner found out, and sued the district, alleging $7 million in damages.   Why did that school violate copyright? They were trying to raise test scores. Even Simpson admits in the article, âThere is immense pressure on administrators to maintain or raise test scores. If that means pirating test workbooks, then that's what they're going to do.â As Simpson explains, these educators âfeel like the ends justify the means.â    What troubles me in all this is that the blame falls on the teachers and administrators rather than where it belongs. If schools received adequate funding, educators could acquire copies of these texts legally. Why is the problem seen as educators disregarding the law instead of as local, state, and federal governments providing inadequate educational resources for students?     The  THE Journal  article contends with its title that educators should â Do the (Copy)right Thing .â By ignoring copyright regulations, teachers and administrators do the wrong thing, which âsends a terrible message to students.â Itâs not that I disagree. Protecting intellectual property rights is important. Iâm just not sure which is the worst message to sendâitâs okay to copy these texts, or we canât afford to let you read them.

I first heard about the holiday when  Grammar Girl ,  Mignon Fogarty, twittered  that she was working on a  Top Ten Grammar Myths podcast  that would celebrate the event. Most English teachers will be familiar with the items on her list:          Â Â    10.    A run-on sentence is a really long sentence.       Â Â    9.    You shouldn't start a sentence with the word  however .     Â Â    8.    Irregardless  is not a word.     Â Â    7.    There is only one way to write the possessive form of a word that ends in  s .     Â Â    6.    Passive voice is always wrong.     Â Â    5.    I.e.  and  e.g.  mean the same thing.     Â Â    4.    You use  a  before words that start with consonants and  an  before words that start with vowels.     Â Â    3.    It's incorrect to answer the question âHow are you?â with the statement âIâm good.â     Â Â    2.    You shouldnât split infinitives.     Â Â    1.    You shouldnât end a sentence with a preposition.       Â Â      (from  http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/top-ten-grammar-myths.aspx )           Those rules are the kinds that make English so frustrating for students to learn. When grammar rules are open to popular controversy, how can students ever pin down the  right  way?    We could explain to students that there are always exceptions or share the old adage âRules are made to be brokenââbut neither response is particularly satisfying. How are language learners to know which rules are real and which are myths? How can they learn the ways that a rule can be broken?      Underlying these issues is perhaps the worst grammar myth language learners bring to the classroom:  There is a correct way to speak and write English . One of the telling things about students and language is that nearly all students, language learners or not, will readily accept this myth as true. It can take only  one correcting voice to convince someone that there is a right and a wrong way to read and write.    I remember getting a new package of stationery from my parents as a reward for babysitting my younger siblings. I quickly wrote letters to my grandparents describing the things that we were all doing that summerâtrips to the beach, walks to the bookmobile, and courses at nearby parks. About a week later, I received a reply that commented on the things we were doing, but ended with admonishing me for errors that Iâd made in my writing.     I felt like the worst writer in the world, and I donât remember writing another letter that summer. I was afraid Iâd make more mistakes.  I was convinced that there was a right way to write and a wrong way to write . . . and  that I could only write in the wrong way. Now, of course, I know thatâs a flawed conclusion, but at the time, it was a myth that I easily accepted as true. There was a  right way , the way of my grandfather, and there was the  wrong way , my way.     For an English language learner, the voice of the  right way  may be a teacher, a correcting peer, or a family member, but the effect is similar. Students  mistrust their own literacy skills and sometimes learn itâs  better not to try. What can we do in response? Try these strategies to support English language learners in the classroom:        Position studentsâ home language and cultural knowledge as useful resources. Ask students to share their expertise with the class and draw comparisons among the ways that different language work.        Start where students are   grammatically. Discuss and extend the grammatical tools they have.           Acknowledge the meanings students have constructed as active language users. Remind students to focus on communicating as they use language.           Discuss grammar in the context of making meaning of texts that students read and write. Grammar should never be an add-on thatâs explored in abstract or unconnected ways.              Explore culturally relevant texts with students. Students will better understand discussions of the form and function of different words and structures when they have a thorough understanding of the ideas expressed by those words and structures.         Explore language myths explicitly by talking about the ways that rules and usage change depending upon a range of factors including the speaker, the audience, and the purpose for the text.

Herr                           MENU:    * BACKGROUND * OBJECTIVES * REQUIREMENTS * PROCEDURE * ASSESSMENT    * OTHER ACTIVITIES * APPENDIX             BACKGROUND:    December 23, 1867, two years after the Civil War had freed her parents, Owen and Minverva Breedlove, Sarah was born on a Louisiana plantation. From around the age of four or five, Sarah began going out to the fields with her parents, her older brother Alex, and her sister Louvenia. Minerva and her daughters earned a few extra pennies doing the laundry for the white customers. Her parents knew that their children needed an education but could not spare the time or money to send any of them away.    Tragedy struck at the age of seven when a yellow fever epidemic took the lives of her parents. Trying to support the family after the farm failed, Alex left for Vicksburg. Meanwhile his sisters survived by taking in laundry. When the yellow fever struck again drying up what little money they made, the sisters followed their brother. Sarah lived with her sister and her new brother-in-law until she married Moses McWilliams at the age of fourteen. Then she and her husband moved into their own home.    At the age of 17 she gave birth to her daughter, A'Lelia. Then at the age of 20 she was widowed when Moses died. Wanting a better life for her daughter, Sarah made a decision to go to St. Louis where there was more business for a laundress. With the money she made there, she sent A'Lelia to get the education Sarah never received. After working for 18 years, Sarah saw her daughter graduate from high school and go to Knoxville College. This accomplished her first goal in life.    In 1904 when the World's Fair came to St. Louis, Sarah was exposed to many new ideas and people. The person who made the biggest impression on her life was Mrs. Booker T. Washington. Seeing a well groomed, literate, and worldly African-American woman, Sarah decided that with her daughter in school she could begin to better her own life.    Sarah was 37 years old and beginning to loose her hair to unknown causes. She claims that at this point her prayers to God to help her save her hair were answered. She dreamed of a man who came and told her the ingredients needed for the mixture to grow back her hair. She made some up in her bathtub, tried it out on herself and discovered it worked. She soon was selling to her friends and neighbors. Unfortunately there was another company in St. Louis that sold similar products. With only $1.50 in her pockets, she moved to Denver, Colorado to begin selling her products around the nation. She originally developed three hair care products: Wonderful Hair Grower, Glossine, and Vegetable Shampoo. These products, made for African-American women, softened and helped straighten their tight curls into the more popular style of the time.    On January 4, 1906, around the time the products were becoming more popular, she married Charles Joseph Walker. This changed her name to Mrs. C. J. Walker. She gave herself the name Madame to add a touch of class to the name of her products.    As her business expanded, Madame Walker began a cross-country tour to show off her product while hiring and training new sales agents; mostly African-American women. Against her husband's advice she moved the business headquarters to Pittsburgh, which was a thriving industrial city. Joined by her daughter, they opened the Lelia College to train sales agents. Here the agents were taught how to use and demonstrate the product, and the door-to-door sales techniques which Madame Walker was the first to use in a large-scale fashion. The agents were also told about good personal habits and hygienic procedures, practices that preceded the state's cosmetology laws. Her agents were soon easily recognizable in their neatly arranged hair, black skirts, and white shirts.    As business continued to grow, Madame Walker moved again, this time to Indianapolis. By 1911 the company employed over 950 agents who earned around $1,000 a month compared with the $45 a month unskilled white workers earned. Soon after these statistics were released Madame Walker divorced her second husband, however, she kept the name.    With all the money she was earning Madame Walker decided to help others. She donated money to many educational funds to help women, African-Americans, and even to start a school in West Africa. Other donations she made were to the National Association of Colored People (NAACP), the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), and the effort to buy and protect the home of Frederick Douglas. She also spent $250,000 for a new home with many luxurious goods for herself and her daughter.    Faced with discrimination, she fought against it by any means available. Once, when told to pay twice the amount that white customers paid for movie tickets, she sued the theater and built her own as part of her ""Walker Building"" complex. When President Wilson began stopping reforms that would give African-Americans more freedom, Madame Walker visited the White House in 1917 to protest the lynching of African-Americans.    By 1918 Madame Walker had been declared the first African-American women to become a millionaire when her company reported yearly sales of $250,000 and was employing nearly 2,000 workers.    At the age of 51, Madame Walker was warned to slow her work pace due to hypertension and other health problems. Unwilling to slow down she became ill and died on May 25, 1919. W. E. B. Du Bois wrote for her obituary ""It is given to few persons to transform a people in a generation. Yet this was done by the late Madam C. J. Walker."" (Brown, ONLINE, 1996). From her poor background and hardship ridden early life, and while trying to better her daughter's and then her own life, Sarah Breedlove had become a millionaire and an inspiration to people all around the world.

TOP OF PAGE             OBJECTIVES:         Students will recognize the achievements of Madame C. J.    Walker.          Students will select one long term and one short term goal and    describe the steps necessary to achieve those goals.          Student wil complete their short term goal.          Students will participate in class discussions.      TOP OF PAGE          REQUIREMENTS:    TIME ALLOTMENT:  Approximately six class periods plus an extra week for the short term goal to be met.    RESOURCES NEEDED:    Maps of the United States (Louisiana)    Case study (see appendix)    Guest speakers (parents and/or community leaders)    Questions about Madame C. J. Walker (see appendix)    Goal completion hand-out (see appendix)    TOP OF PAGE             PROCEDURES :    1.  VALUES WHIP/GROUP DISCUSSION . Ask the students to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Then ask each student to share his/her ideas. Allow students to pass if desired. After everyone has been asked return to those who passed and asked them again.    2.  MINI-LECTURE . Talk about how they think they will achieve this goal or if they think they may change their mind. Then talk about Madame C. J. Walker, mention how she started as a laundry person and ended up a millionaire, and discuss the goals she set in life and how she achieved them. Mention a few of the problems she had as well as the successes before and after she became famous. Be sure to locate the different places she lived as you tell the story of her life.    3.  NUMBERED HEADS . Split the class into groups of five students. Once they are in their groups have them number off 1-5. Give each group enough copies of the questions ( see appendix ), for each member to have one. Each team will be responsible for making sure everyone in the group can answer all the questions. Call out a number from 1-5 and a number of a question. The first number is which member of the group will answer the question, the second which question they will answer. The students will answer orally if called upon by the teacher, even if all they say is that someone already said their answer. Go through and make sure each person has a chance to answer one question, then answer the unused questions in an open forum.    4.  GUEST SPEAKER . Invite family members and community leaders in to discuss goals they have set for themselves, how they reached them, and any problems they had to overcome. Afterwards have the students write a reflection paper on things they found interesting about goals people set, how they reached them, obstacles they faced, and how they overcame the obstacles.    5.  THINK-PAIR-SHARE . Have students individually think of a time they planned out how to do something and then followed through. Remind them of Madame Walker's goals and how she followed through with them. Example of answers if they get stuck are vacations, what to do during a ball game, building something, getting money to get something special, or a job they did. Then have the students share with a partner or two how they planned it out and why. Then as a large group allow students to share what, why, and how they did it and how it came out.    6.  ROLE PLAYING . Remind students that Madame Walker did not achieve her goals without some problems interfering or disrupting her goal. In teams students are given a scenario ( see appendix ) of someone trying to reach a goal, but a problem has appeared. As a team the students must figure out a solution then act out the entire scene including the solution. Afterwards the rest of the class can ask why they chose that solution as opposed to the other answers.    7.  VALUES WHIP . Madame Walker had grown up with little money. She spent a lot of her money for different causes, but she also lived well with her daughter. Pose the following question to the students: ""If you had a million dollars what would you do with it?"" Allow a few minutes to think about it, then starting with the teacher have each student tell their answers or pass. After all have had a chance to respond ask those who passed if they would like to speak, though they don't have to speak. Then open the floor to allow students to question each other about their choices, however, this does not mean critisizing the choise by calling it ""dumb"". Be ready for long discussion of values and ethic that may come up. Once all have spoken the session can end.    8.   BRAINSTORMING . In small groups have students think of long term and short term goals they want to set. Inform them that they will be writing out both goals and how they plan to accomplish the goals. The short term goal will be for 7 days. These will be checked upon periodically during the week. The long term goals can be any length of time as these will not be checked for completion, however, they will be looked at for realistic ideas (no superhero powers). Then have the students write out what they have decided for personal long and short term goals. If something becomes a problem for the student in keeping their short term goal help them set a new one or be ready to extend the time period. After they are finished they need to fill out the hand-out in the  appendix . Part of the planning is what the students will do to celebrate the achievement of their goal.    9.  JOURNAL . Have students start keeping a daily log about how their short term goal is coming. Include difficulties and decisions made, thoughts, feelings, why they chose this goal, and what they plan as their reward.    TOP OF PAGE             ASSESSMENT :    1. Answering the question during the whip discussion group.    2. The quality of the answers given by the group and the quality of the individuals answer.    3. The paper the students wrote about the guest speaker(s).    4. Participating and keeping on track during the pair section of Think-Pair-Share.    5. Participation in thinking about the problem, acting out the solution, and answering the questions afterward.    6. Final paper detailing the short and long term goal, the means by which they think to attain it, any obstacle they foresee, and if they goals are possible to attain.    7. Attain their short term goal and filling out the hand-out.    8. Keeping a daily journal of what they are doing to achieve the short term goal, problems, solutions, and their feelings about what's happening.    TOP OF PAGE             OTHER ACTIVITIES :    SERVICE PROJECTS . Have the students look at the community around them and find a problem they think they could solve working together as a class. Have them plan out what they are going to do. If students work on different parts of the project in groups, have weekly meetings (or daily) to discuss problems and ways they could solve them. The student can keep journals of what they did and how it turned out.    GROUP SOLUTIONS . Separate students into groups of 3-5 students. Beforehand create a packet relevant to where the school is. The packet will contain goals for each person, but each goal has problems that relate to the others. (i.e. Someone wants to put up a shopping mall where the only park in the area is. The community wants a community center and the environmentalists want to protect the park.) The individuals must decide what they want to do and then discuss it with the group to be sure that all the plans will work together. They can then present their ideas to the class or write up a report.    TRIP PLANNING . Have the students decide individually or in small groups a place on earth they would like to visit. Have them plan out how they would get there, what they would do, lodging, transportation, and money. Then have a travel agent bring in some brochures, prices and ideas to help the planning.    INVENTION FAIR . Have the students individually or in groups of two or three come up with an invention and build it. Then have them run a simulation advertising campaign to see if people would buy their invention.    TOP OF PAGE          APPENDIX     Â     NUMBERED HEADS QUESTIONS    Â     Â     1.

RETURN TO PROCEDURE             ROLE PLAYING CASE STUDY    Â     Sam is a sixth grader who plays basketball. He has been having trouble staying up with his homework because of his basketball practices and games. His parents have threatened to not let him play anymore if his grades don't come up. Sam has just taken a test that he doesn't think he did well on. He has a book report tomorrow and a game this weekend. If he didn't pass the test the report is the only grade that will allow him to play. After school, an hour is spent in distributing the newspaper. He has time before dinner with his family to work on homework. At 6:00 PM he has basketball practice for an hour and then the evening is free. He is almost finished with the book and has a computer at home to work on it. However, during school he ran into his friend Dan who had just bought a brand new computer game and asked him over to play. Sam has been waiting to play this game for a long time. Also during school his friends invited him to go hang out before the game at the video arcade where all the ""cool"" high school basketball player hang out. Sometimes his coach keeps him and the other starting players after an extra half hour to practice important plays if the last game was closer than he likes, and the last game was by one point. After practice Sam takes a shower and is always tired.    Â     WHAT SHOULD SAM DO?    Â     (CAN CHANGE TO A FEMALE CHARACTER IN SIMILAR SITUATION.)

Sign Up Discuss  in my Forum   Thank You Letters Writing Thank You Letters By  Alison Doyle , About.com    See More About: thank you letters writing thank you letters thank you letter samples     Thank You Note Copyright Carlos Arranz              Writing a thank you letter, or thank you email, after an employment interview is a must. In fact, some employers think less of those interviewees who fail to follow-up promptly. Plan to send out your thank you letters or  thank you notes  as soon as possible (preferably within twenty-four hours) after your interview.    Customize Your Thank You Letters  Like any piece of writing, it is best to keep your audience in mind. Address their issues and concerns. In general, typed (paper or email) thank you letters are recommended.  However, some surveys  suggest than hiring managers like hand written thank notes, too. So, consider the ""personality"" of the organization and the rapport you felt during your interviews. If your interview was a fairly informal process and/or you achieved an immediate rapport with your interviewer, a handwritten note is fine.  When you're not sure what to write, review  thank you letter samples  and  follow up letter samples  to get ideas.  You can also use a  thank you letter template  as a guide when writing your letters.  In addition to thanking the person you talked with, the thank you letter reinforces the fact that you want the job. Note: Even if you do not want the job, write a thank you letter respectfully  withdrawing your application , because you never know what the future holds so why burn your bridges?    View Your Thank You Letters as Sales Letters   You may also view your thank you letters as follow-up ""sales"" letters. In other words, you can restate why you want the job, what your qualifications are, how you might make significant contributions, and so on. This thank you letter is also the perfect opportunity to discuss anything of importance that your interviewer neglected to ask or that you neglected to answer as thoroughly, or as well, as you would have liked.   Group Thank You Letters    What if you spent an entire day being interviewed (and taken to lunch) with several people? Are individual thank you notes appropriate or should you write a ""group"" letter? Choose your approach based on what you think will be most in keeping with the ""personality"" of the organization. Also, consider whether the interviews had very much in common with one another. If there was a great deal of similarity (i.e., shared concerns mutually voiced by your interviewers), perhaps a ""group"" letter will suffice.  My preference though, would be to take the extra time and send an individual thank you letter to everyone you met with.   Lunch or Dinner Interviews  When  dining and interviewing  be sure to thank everyone you spend time with, both for the meal and for taking the time to discuss the position and the company with you.    When You're Not Sure What to Write   Time takes precedence - get a simple, appreciative thank you note in the mail or send a  thank you by email  without delay; save your creative efforts for another time. If you're not sure what to write, review a few  sample thank you letters  or personalize our  thank you letter template .    Remember to Proofread  Check spelling, grammar, typos, etc. If in doubt about the correct names, spellings or titles of your interviewers, call the office to double-check. Your efforts will be worth it!    Sample Thank You Letters  Review a selection of sample thank you letters.

It is okay to ask the person interviewing you for a business card. Often, they will just give you a card without you needing to ask. Step 2: Be sure you know the exact title of the job you're trying to get. You need to use this in the note. Step 3: Get decent stationary or a blank greeting card and matching envelope. Printing out a color card is also okay, but not considered as polite as stationary or a card. Step 4: Write down the name of the person who interviewed you, followed by a colon. If the name was John Smith, then you write, ""Dear John Smith:"" Step 5: Write something like ""Thank you for interviewing me for the position of (job title). My experience and professionalism can be a great benefit for (name of company).  I look forward to hearing from you."" You can use your own words or follow the examples in the sample letters listed in Resources section. Step 6: Use a business-friendly closing such as ""Sincerely"" or ""Gratefully."" Now is not the time to be cute. Step 7: When you sign, make sure your contact information is under your signature. If your signature is illegible, print your name under the signature. Make it as easy as possible for them to remember your name. Step 8: Put in the mailbox and cross your fingers. Tips & Warnings For jobs with a really high turnover such as fast food service, Christmas help or a retail store clerk, you don't have to send a thank you note. Many people send an email thank you note instead. However, it lacks the emotional punch of a real note or card. Unless the interviewer tells you that you can call him or her by the first name, stick to full names or a formal greeting. Don't write more than a few sentences. Although you want to remind the company of who you are, you don't want to put them to sleep. Don't include your resume with the thank you note. They already have it. Sending it again will make you look desperate and unprofessional.

It was Frank E. Hering,                                            a Past Grand Worthy President of the                                            Fraternal Order of Eagles, that made                                            the first known public plea for a national                                            day to honor our mothers. And it was                                            Frank E. Hering who in 1925 was invited                                            by the ""Society of War Mothers""                                            to participate in a special Mother's                                            Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.                                            There, at the ""Tomb of the Unknown                                            Soldier"", before a tremendous audience                                            that included many congressmen and senators,                                            Hering was introduced as ""the Father                                            of Mother's Day.""                                              But                                            that was over 21 years after Hering's                                            first public plea, and 11 years after                                            President Woodrow Wilson by Proclamation                                            officially made Mother's Day the second                                            Sunday in May. And many things happened                                            during that span of time. A lot of hard                                            work, a lot of other people trying to                                            take the credit, and even an article                                            by Hering himself titled......                                           ""NOW                                            WE FIGHT!""                                           That                                            was the headline over the Mother's Day                                            editorial in a decades-ago issue of                                            Eagle Magazine.                                           The                                            Mother's Day editorial? And what in                                            the world could there have been to fight                                            about on a national holiday dedicated                                            to dear old Mom? It was the fact, grumbled                                            the editorial, that ""organizations                                            and individuals are grasping at the                                            honor that belongs to the F.O.E. for                                            internationally sponsoring this memorial.""

The                                            answer, of course, was obvious, but                                            the editorial's conclusion spelled it                                            out anyway:                                           ""Through                                            the early years, we carried on alone.

THE                                            AUTHOR of those fighting words were                                            Frank E. Hering.

Hering.                                            The                                            idea had first come to him as a faculty                                            member of the University of Notre Dame,                                            in his hometown of South Bend Indiana.                                            Walking into a classroom of a fellow                                            instructor, Hering found his colleague                                            distributing penny postcards to the                                            students there. They addressed the cards                                            and began to scribble messages on them.                                                                                       ""What                                            are they writing?"" inquired the                                            bemused Hering of his faculty mate.                                           ""Anything,""                                            replied the other, ""Anything at                                            all as long as it's to their mothers.""                                                                                       A                                            light bulb went on in Frank Hering's                                            head. And the idea for a SPECIAL DAY                                            that would provide some sort of FORMAL                                            RECOGNITION FOR MOTHERS continued to                                            burn there. Hering was involving himself                                            more and more in an organization that                                            had begun just a few years before on                                            the waterfront in Seattle and was catching                                            on all over the country - the Fraternal                                            Order of Eagles. By 1904, Hering was                                            a past officer of the Aerie in South                                            Bend.                                           On                                            February 7th of that year, he was the                                            Main speaker at a memorial sponsored                                            by Indianapolis Aerie #211, at the English                                            Opera House. It was there that he first                                            verbalized publicly his idea of a ""national                                            day of honor for Mothers.""                                            Shortly                                            thereafter Hering became a national                                            officer, eventually becoming Grand Worthy                                            President in 1909 and again in 1911.                                            All through these years in his travels                                            across the country his plea for a national                                            Mother's Day was a standard feature                                            of his appearances at Eagle functions                                            and occasions. In 1912, he submitted                                            to the Grand Aerie, a recommendation                                            that local Aeries be given an opportunity                                            to hold Mother's Day exercises ""on                                            any Sunday during the year."" Approval                                            was swift, and individual Aeries throughout                                            the land began to carry the torch for                                            Mother's Day.                                           LEGISLATION                                            was introduced in the U.S. congress                                            by 1914, requesting a presidential proclamation                                            making the second Sunday in May (a date                                            urged by Anna Jarvis, another crusader                                            for a memorial day for mothers) Mother's                                            day throughout the country. President                                            Woodrow Wilson went along with the idea,                                            and May 10, 1914 became the first official                                            Mother's Day.

Walker was 37 years old when she found herself slowly losing her hair. She would wake up each morning with new clumps of hair on her pillow that had fallen out the night before. She did not know what was causing it, but suspected a combination of poor diet and stress. It is now known to have been a common problem among black women in that time. But while others might have just disguised their problem with a wig, or hidden themselves away from the rest of the world, Walker decided to turn the  crisis  into an opportunity.   At first glance, life did not seem to have much to offer to the young Walker. Sharing a one-room cabin on a cotton plantation with her family of seven was less than accommodating. Living with an abusive brother in law and being widowed at the age of 19 did not help the situation. Losing her hair in her 30 was icing on the cake. In each of these cases, however, Walked demonstrated her ability to not only live through the  crisis,  but to change her fate and  act  on them.    As a young girl, Walker recognized that her family was living on the brink. They were poor, and sleeping on the mud floor of their cabin made that point all too clear. But instead of spending her childhood playing with friends and doing normal kid things, Walker put herself to work and accompanied her parents onto the cotton fields every day almost as soon as she could walk. She was determined to make her own little contribution.   After the death of her parents, Walker decided it would be best to move in with her older sister. An abusive relationship with her sister husband quickly changed her mind. Instead of accepting the treatment as did her sister, Walker looked for a way out. She found her answer in a marriage of her own.   Being single again and losing her hair proved to be the ultimate  crisis  combination. Together, they would give her the motivation she needed to start up her own business. She needed to support herself since no one else would, and she wanted to find a solution to her hair problems. She chose to  act  on the  crisis  instead of  accept  it.   Walker began to inkerwith a few different existing solutions until she found something she liked. And, instead of just keeping it for herself, she decided to go one step further and market it. And, instead of just selling it within the U.S., Walker decided to take her product international. She embarked on a selling campaign throughout Jamaica, Cuba, Costa Rica, Panama and Haiti.   Walker was always on the lookout for an opportunity, and by and large, she took those opportunities when she was in the midst of a difficult time in her life. It was by acting on crises instead of accepting them that Walker was able to turn a scanty living into a success.

For women like 35-year-old Mercila Hembrom in rural India, the value of skilled midwifery care is evidentâboth she and her son are alive and well.     For her previous five pregnancies, Mercila sought antenatal care from the local auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) named Sangita Kumari, but had the local Dai (traditional birth attendant) deliver her at home. Sadly, she lost her last child soon after childbirth.    In this pregnancy, Mercila learned that Sangita had received a recent training on pregnancy, childbirth and newborn care as one of 37 ANMs trained by the ACCESS Program in Dumka. With support from the U.S. Agency for International Development, ACCESS and  the Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA) are implementing an operations research project in selected blocks of Dumka district of Jharkhand. The aim is to demonstrate that the delivery of life saving skills by ANMsâcombined with behavior change communication (BCC) activities for surrounding communitiesâimproves the access to and use of key maternal and neonatal care services, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and reduced morbidity and mortality of mothers and newborns. These efforts support the Government of Indiaâs Ministry of Health and Family Welfare initiative to increase skilled attendance at birth by training ANMs, who are the health care providers closest to communities, to assist women during delivery and refer for emergency care. As a result, trained ANMs may now perform life saving skills.             ANMs practicing in the skills lab (above), and then providing care in the community during training (below). Â               At the start of the ACCESS program in Dumka, ANMs knew little about the importance of early breastfeeding and maintenance of newborn body temperature, both essential neonatal care skills. None of the ANMs had experience with newborn resuscitation or newborn assessment, and few of the recently certified ANMs had skills in newborn immunization. ACCESS provided 12 weeks of refresher training that covered the full range of competencies and included clinical practice in communities. The two local ANM schools at Sadar District Hospital in Dumka and Mohulpahari Christian Hospital were equipped with clinical training materials, models and skills labs, and faculty and future trainers learned effective teaching skills.    At the community level, knowledge about birth preparedness and complications readiness (BP/CR) was very low. For example, only about 7% of almost 800 recent mothers surveyed in August 2007 could name three or more newborn danger signs. In these rural areas, beyond the limited numbers of locally-available, skilled health care providers, there are also other barriers to accessing skilled careâdistance, transportation, cost and unsatisfactory past experiences with the public health care system.    To increase demand for maternal and newborn care, ACCESS trained and mobilized community members in more than 200 villages. These villagers then raised awareness and advocated for local action. As a result, by August 2008: 100% of these villages had a functional emergency transport system for BP/CR during pregnancy and childbirth; 69% were actively using the services provided by the ACCESS-trained ANM in their area; and over 270 community savings groups now have BP/CR savings plans. Community workers from a local  nongovernmental organization work with the villages and counsel women in their homes on BP/CR, skilled care during childbirth, and postpartum and newborn care.    During Mercila's sixth pregnancy, she met a community worker, Mary Mina Hembrom, who gave her friendly advice whenever they would meet, even while fetching water. In this way, Mercila and her family learned about the importance of having a trained, skilled provider during birth, and the danger signs for mother and baby. When Mercila went into labor on a November morning, her husband called Sangita. Within an hour, Sangita arrived with her equipment and drugs, and assessed Mercilaâs labor status. After a long delivery, a baby boy was born; however, he was blue and not breathing. Quickly, Sangita cleared the mucus from his mouth and nose, and dried and covered him. She then separated the baby by clamping and cutting the cord, and began resuscitating him with a bag and mask. After 20 minutes, the baby was stable and breathing normally. During this time, Sangita had also cared for Mercila, ensuring she took misoprostol and performing active management of the third stage of labor  (AMTSL).          As a result of ACCESS interventions:     100% of mobilized villages have a functional emergency transport system for BP/CR;      69% of these villages are using trained ANM services; and     100% of deliveries attended by ACCESS-trained ANMs in the past month received AMTSL and the three key essentials of newborn care.       Sangita stayed with the mother and baby to provide immediate postpartum care, initiate breastfeeding, and explain the postnatal and newborn danger signs. During the next week, she came back to check on Mercila and her son three times. Mary Mina, the community worker, had also visited the mother at home and counseled her on exclusive breastfeeding and family planning.     Today, Mercila is very happy with her 7-month-old son and is thankful for the services provided by Mary Mina and Sangita. Her story highlights ACCESS's work in Dumka and illuminates the numerous opportunities to save lives with  skilled birth attendants and community mobilization. ANMs, once trained, have been able to provide community-based maternal and newborn care competently and increase access to and use of these services. Moreover, women, families and communities in Dumka have quickly learned about maternal and newborn care, and have been willing and able to seek services, plan for childbirth and be prepared for complications.

Every molecule in our body is focused on doing what we love. At other times, necessity and responsibility dictate that we put our dreams aside and do what needs to be done. It is during these moments that we may choose to forget what it is that we love to do. There are many other reasons for why we may leave our passions behind. A hobby may lose its appeal once weve realize it will never turn into our dream job. Someone important to us may keep telling us that our passions are childish and unsuitable  until we finally believe them. Forgetting about what you love to do can be a form of self-sabotage. If you can forget about your dreams, then you never have to risk failure. But just because weve decided to ignore our passions doesnt mean they no longer exist. Nothing can fill the emptiness that remains in a space vacated by a passion that we have tossed aside. Besides, life is too short to stop doing what you love, and it is never too late to rediscover your favorite things. If you gave up playing an instrument, painting, drawing, spending time in nature, or any other activity or interest that you once loved to do, now may be the time to take up that passion again. If you dont remember what it is that you used to be passionate about, you may want to think about the activities or interests that you used to love or the dreams that you always wished you could pursue. You dont have to neglect your responsibilities to pursue your passions, and you dont have to neglect your commitments to do what you love. When you make an effort to incorporate your interests into your life, the fire within you ignites. You feel excited, inspired, and fed by the flames that are sparked by living your life with passion for what you love.

Go  HERE   to see the Lunar New Year stamp on the site. On January 8, 2009, in New York, New York, the Postal Service"" will issue a 42cent, Celebrating Lunar New Year Year of the Ox commemorative stamp, designed by Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, Maryland.The U.S. Postal Service introduced its Celebrating Lunar New Year series in 2008. This is the second stamp in that series, which will continue through 2019 with stamps for the Year of the Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar.In 2008, a stamp depicting festive red lanterns was issued to mark the Year of the Rat. Art Director Ethel Kessler and artist Kam Mak, who grew up in New York Citys Chinatown and now lives in Brooklyn, decided to focus on some of the common ways the Lunar New Year Holiday is celebrated. To commemorate the Year of the Ox, which begins January 26, 2009, they chose a lion head of a type often worn at parades and other festivities. Kesslers design also incorporates elements from the previous series of Lunar New Year stamps, using Clarence Lees intricate papercut design of an ox and the Chinese character drawn in grassstyle calligraphy by Lau Bun for Ox. Labels:  Lunar New Year                                posted by Eleanor Traubman @  Monday, January 12, 2009                   0 comments          links to this post                                                                     Sunday, January 11, 2009                                                    TEN TIPS FOR GETTING ORGANIZED                                      MYTH:  Being organized means having a home that resembles the pages of Real Simple magazine, with nary an object out of place! TRUTH:  Being organized means having a few systems and tools in place which free you up to spend more time with your friends and family and less time hunting for things you need or stressing about piles of stuff that have no rhyme or reason. Here are ten organizing practices to get you going: 1. Set aside time to open your mail every day! Open mail over a trash/recycling can and throw out solicitations and other junk mail. Daily mail sorting prevents paper pile-up and the resulting feelings of overwhelm. 2. Use the RAFT acronym for handling papers. R = Refer to someone else A = Act on it if the action takes 5 minutes or less OR put it in an action pile F = File it T = Toss it! 3. Put old financial or archival documents which you dont need to refer to often in a bankers box and store on a high shelf. Create homes (binders, files, whatever works for you) for papers which come in on a regular basis  financial statements, bills, etc. 4. For de-cluttering, set aside a specific amount of time. Its helpful to use a kitchen timer. Pick an area that you know you will be able to complete in that time frame  e.g., two shelves on the bookshelf, a dresser drawer, the top of your desk. 5. Look at one item at a time. Make a decision about each item before going on to the next. Do you want to keep it, toss it, repair it, or donate it? Make a pile for each category. 6. While going through books, clothing, jewelry, etc., ask yourself: Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I use it? Do I want it? Do I feel good when I wear it, use it, look at it? Keep or let go based on the answer. 7. When you come up against I might need this someday, trust that you can get what you need when the occasion arises. 8. With gifts and other objects of sentimental value, ask yourself: Can I hold onto the memory without holding onto the object? Choose the most precious memories and store or display them so that they are easily accessed  in albums or decorative storage boxes. 9. Have a designated place in your apartment for give-aways so that everyone can get into the habit of putting unused or unwanted stuff there. Choose a charity that you can easily walk or cab your stuff to, or one that makes pick-ups. 10. Put a vase of flowers anywhere in your apartment where clutter tends to accumulate. Its less tempting to let clutter build up where there is beauty!

Adam Zeisel, grandson of design icon  Eva Zeisel , sent me an amazing  set of bronze candlestick holders  which Eva designed. After receiving the set in the mail, I went out to the local five and dime store and got a bunch of rose and fuschia colored candlesticks which look great with the bronze. I love having a tangible reminder of Eva's creative spirit in my home. Adam offers this set on  http://www.evazeiseloriginals.com/  at a nice discount only because there are tiny imperfections (e.g. mine came with a little scratch that I could barely see.) AND he is offering Creative Times readers a further discount:  pay $30 if you purchase an individual candlestick and $25/per if you purchase the three-pieced set. When ordering, please make a note in the comment's field that youwish to receive the 'Creative Times' discount and Adam will apply it to your final invoice. Here is the website description of this item: Made using the ancient method of sand casting, these three beauties get their smooth bronze finish by heating them over raw coals and then dipping them in an aging solution. The process is repeated until the desired color is reached. All work is 100% hand-crafted until the final finish. This updated version does not have a felt bottom.

"" Inspiration is a direct result of working . I'm hardly ever inspired by just lounging around the apartment. I paint cityscapes, so as I'm walking around the city doing my daily errands I'm always scouting for interesting subjects. I've got a mental catalog of places that have a unique character and every few weeks I go on a picture safari to document these locations. While shooting pictures I stay open to whatever activity is happening and just keep clicking away. The second type of inspiration comes in reviewing the photos. There's always some sort of happy surprise waiting, an odd perspective or some intriguing interaction on the street that managed to get captured in a background. This is really about recognizing a special moment - not passing over a photo that's a little blurred or oddly cropped. Since I use the photos as a rough sketch they can be technically imperfect - I actually prefer the imperfections because they've got more potential. The third form of inspiration comes when the paint (finally) hits the canvas. I paint in a style that relies on improvisation, there's plenty of room for unexpected occurances which are also inspiring. I really enjoy exploiting the spontaneous acts that divert me from the planned route. An unexpected color combination or a drawing error can lead to something wonderful. I don't get too attached to my original concept of an artwork, everything is flexible and open to change. A painting never finishes exactly the way I expect, which makes everything much more interesting. Ultimately I'm inspired by the endless possibilities in every artwork.""

Her newest novel is ""a story about three generations of artists who are grappling with the source of creativity and the limits of love.""  The book comes out in February of this year.  To pre-order Jennie's novel,  CLICK HERE .   The questions I use to interview Jennie can be found in Twyla Tharp's book called  The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life .  I pulled a dozen of the 39 questions Twyla asks and answers to form her own creative autobiography. CT:   Describe your first successful creative act. JN:  In 4th grade, we were invited to submit poems for a collection that our class was going to make into a book. I wrote poem after poem  about puppies? Flowers? I have no idea. But I remember very clearly seeing the words I wrote printed on purple mimeograph paper with my byline above them, sandwiched between cardboard covers. I thought it was a thrill. CT:   Was anyone there to witness or appreciate it? JN:  Im sure my teacher and my parents said, Nice job, but their praise wasnt the point  and I think thats what made it a successful act. The impulse to write those poems and the pride I felt when I saw them published was wholly about me. CT:   What is the best idea you ever had? JN:  That I should try writing fiction. CT:   What made it great in your mind? JN:  It felt like coming home. CT:   Can you connect the dots that led you to this idea? JN:  It came to me all at once, on a stage in front of a thousand people in Anchorage, Alaska. I was giving a keynote address to a room full of breast cancer survivors. The year before, theyd had a world famous surgeon, a woman whos actually trying to cure cancer. I was paralyzed with the thought that, compared to her, I had nothing to say that mattered.  I got up to the podium, and realized that what I had was this: I am a storyteller.  And I realized that it mattered very much. CT:   What is your creative ambition? JN:  To write good books for an appreciative audience that continues to grow. CT:   What are the obstacles to this ambition? JN:  Complacency, fear, doubt and a collapsing book industry. CT:   What are the vital steps to achieving this ambition? JN:  In order to write good books, I think I have to pay attention (to the world, to my own intuition, to my stories) and give myself permission to create. As for connecting with an audience? I guess we all have to pray that booksellers stay in business, editors keep their jobs, and publishing houses keep the faith. CT:   How do you begin your day? JN:  I eat breakfast with my husband and our two teenage daughters, which is to say that we all sit down at the table together and we eat; we hardly ever talk. I read three newspapers  fast. I scan the news, and look for interesting stories, mostly in the Calendar, Arts or Living sections. CT:   Which artists do you admire most? JN:  It usually changes depending on my latest favorite book. Right now, I most admire Abigail Thomas, author of the memoir A Three Dog Life and Elizabeth Strout, author of the story collection Olive Kitteridge. CT:   Why are they your role models? JN:  They take the raw material of everyday life and make something dazzling out of it. Everyday life doesnt always feel dazzling to me, but these authors remind me that, in fact, it is. CT:   What do you and your role models have in common? JN:  Hope.

I was so happy to find it in our neighborhood movie rental place, Video-free Brooklyn. If you want to catch it on the tele, watch  Planet B-Boy  on MTV this Sunday the 11th at 11:00 am or 12 midnight. In this Benson Lee documentary, the camera narrows in on breakdance crews from five different parts of the world as they prepare for the ""The Battle of the Year"" - an international break dance contest which takes place in Germany. There are a bunch of things I love about this film. First, it lets us see how five crews operate as a group. Also, it focuses on some of the individual young men in these groups - namely, on their relationship to b-boying and to their families who are sometimes skeptical of the art form. There is a theme of Asian fathers wondering if their sons' involvement in b-boying is going to bring honor or stability to the family or community. When young men are part of a team who wins ""The Battle of the Year"" ( a huge honor, considering that 10,000 spectators come from all ends of the earth to watch this competition), families and entire countries change their mind about the validity of b-boying. At ""The Battle of the Year,"" teams from different countries eye each other suspiciously at the beginning and end up having some great bonding moments which rely on non-verbal communication given the language barriers. This film highlights what makes b-boying an important passion for young men. (And, I might add, what makes it a desirable alternative to the preparation for warfare that all young men receive through socialization or actual military training.):  B-boying simulates battle, but there is no violence; instead, there is genuine opening for athleticism; self- and group-expression; creative collaboration; artistry; dance; a connection to music, and friendships based on mutual respect with other young men.

Just plain old dancing on a dance floor with lots of other people. I always had some ""reason"" I couldn't: I didn't know of anywhere to go; I didn't have a big enough group to go with; my body was stiff and out of shape. Yesterday, I spied a postcard advertising  Brooklyn Museum's First Saturday  and this one was called ""Celebrate the Magic of Dance!"" The back of the card was filled with a lineup of films, speakers, and interactive dance-related events. I took the card home and said ""Come on, Mike - let's go!"" So we got on our tennies and motored over to the museum. First, we stopped in the cafe. It was packed with people of all colors and ages. Then we went to watch a very energetic guy named Ifetayo lead a West Indian dance class for the public. He got lots of the audience involved - young ones, men, women. I stayed on the sidelines. Then we went and looked at the special exhibition -  The Black List Project . And then listened to a student guide give a Sign Language-interpreted talk about the project. Finally, we mozied over to the Chicago House Dance Party deejayed by  DJ Quentin Harris . First, Mike and I did some subtle boogeying on the edges of where people were dancing. Over time, we moved closer and closer to the middle of the dancing until we were a few bodies away from the DJ. It was so fun to be smashed up against other people, other people who were also dancing their hearts out.  (See photo above taken by Mike on his cell phone.) Even though we got home late at night, I turned on the t.v. and watched the movie  Save the Last Dance . I shed some tears because the main characters played by Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Harris both get their dreams: ""Sara"" gets into Julliard to study dance and ""Dereck"" gets into Georgetown to be pre-med. So Sara, Dereck and I all had our dreams come true last night!

They are the Simply Chic and Eye Candy Collections of organizational products by  Carolina Pad  and Paper and designer Jacqueline Savage McFee. I love the colorful geometric and modern patterns& I swear they make organizing more fun.As a work-from-home mom of three I have the lovely challenge of trying to be on top of the kids and the household papers all while keeping my work environment uncluttered and clean. I have failed miserably in this effort the past couple of months and as the summer has been winding down, Ive been having some increasing anxiety about the  desperate  need to get myself organized. Well, school started today, and with it arrived backpacks full of paper,& so tonight I organized my little heart out and I even did it with a smile.

(c) [2007] [Dena Pasis] licensed to About.com, Inc             The only thing getting in the way of you getting organized is, yourself! The good news is, there are 5 things that you can do today, to start accomplishing your organizational goals:      Stop Making Excuses:  Instead of giving into all the reasons why today isnât a good day to get organized, start focusing on why today  is  a good day to get organized!     Schedule an Appointment to Get Organized:   Use your daily planner, calendar or phone, and schedule an appointment, as you would for the doctor or a business meeting, and label it 'get organized'. Treat it like any other important appointment or meeting and attend to it.       Be Realistic about Your Expectations:     Attempting to organize your entire bedroom (closet, dresser, nightstand, etc.)  may be an overwhelming task. Instead, tackle one area at a time. For example, start with the closet. If youâre still motivated and have the time, follow with the dresser. Otherwise, schedule it for another day.       Limit Your Distractions:     Cell phones, television or the computer can easily distract you from the task at hand. Keep these distracting items out of reach while you are organizing.     Reward yourself:     After you accomplish your organizational task, reward yourself by participating in an activity that you enjoy doing. For example, you can spend half an hour watching your favorite television show. When we know there is a reward at stake, it can make a task easier to accomplish.   The key to getting organized is to be consistent, and set yourself an organizing goal to accomplish every week. The combination of consistency and these 5 easy tips, will have you organized in no time!          New Year, New You How-to guides for accomplishing all your resolutions.

Acting out to save lives in India                                       December 15, 2008                                                                                                                              Street dramas are a useful way to reach rural audiences.                                                    UPDATE: Videos from one of the street performances are available on  Ipas's Youtube site.    Thirty-seven years ago, India enacted the liberal Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, thereby allowing Indian women to terminate pregnancies under a broad range of conditions. Unfortunately, many Indian women, especially those living in rural areas, are still unaware that abortion is legal and continue to resort to unsafe services, risking their health and their lives. Ipas is exploring innovative and creative ways to reach these women whose health and lives are in danger because they lack access to information. One strategy seems to garner particular enthusiasm: street drama!       Every hour, an Indian woman will die from an unsafe abortion. Women living in rural settings are especially at risk as they are often more isolated than urban women and must rely on husbands or relatives, rather than health-care providers or medical literature, for health information. With little or no education and low rates of literacy, many women cannot benefit from traditional sources of information such as newspapers and pamphlets. In addition, there may be little access to electricity in rural villages which means women do not have access to information on the television or the radio. To overcome these barriers to information,  Ipas India  is piloting innovative communication strategies to bring information on abortion to 253 villages in Jharkhand state in Eastern India.     In communities where few can read, street drama is an engaging way to spread information, raise awareness and get individuals involved. Ipas India has been working with Contact Base, a local organization, to develop street drama that highlights where and how safe abortion services can be obtained and introduces the concept of medical abortion (abortions induced by medication, rather than surgically). Street drama scripts are developed to be as culturally relevant as possible and incorporate the local dialects and practices of a particular village. They are pre-tested in the community for feedback before Contact Base hires and trains young local talents to present the ""oeuvre""to the public, increasing community ownership and sustainability.     One actress described her excitement to be part of the street drama: ""This is my first drama performance. I am acting as a lady doctor. I really feel good when [the] audience asks me several questions on their unwanted pregnancy [imagining] that I am a real doctor. I feel proud to contribute something for the wellness of my community.""   Before the show, there is dancing and singing as the actors declare that they have come to perform a drama about women's reproductive health and that people should sit down to watch. They also announce that there will be a quiz after the show and that people who answer correctly will be presented with small gifts. Through their vivid and descriptive scripts, the actors are able to deliver life-saving information to women who would otherwise remain unaware of the rights and services available to them.     Another advantage of street drama is that it attracts community members of all genders, age and caste. Furthermore, they create a space for men and women to access information and talk together openly about reproductive health issues. Tarun Jha, medical abortion project coordinator at Ipas India, says that the communal aspect of street drama creates a ""public and non-intrusive form of communication,"" where ""you can talk about sensitive social issues without being put on the spot.""    Ipas India has held 350 interactive street dramas since September. By combining street dramas with other innovative communication methods such as local health intermediaries and colorful billboards, Ipas expects to reach over 25,000 women in Jharkhand state by the end of December.

Noticing changes in your memory function as you age is completely normal!     Approaching midlife often brings challenges of many kinds â including normal memory loss or forgetfulness. If and when those incidents of memory loss seem to be happening more frequently, they can be frightening. âWhere the heck did I put the car keys?â âWhat was the name of that movie we just saw?â âWhat did I come in here for?â    Changes in memory function can begin in  your 40s or 50s  and come slowly or gradually at first. The fact is that some memory loss, forgetfulness, or ""fuzzy brain"" is perfectly normal after turning fifty, and probably does not signal the onset of a debilitating memory disorder or dementia such as Alzheimer's.   About Memory Function   There are many types of memory that deal with everything from remembering what the word ""spoon"" means, to being able to recall a neighbor's phone number. The ability to drive a car or put on a pair of pants becomes an inherent part of you, as opposed to remembering computer passwords at will, which may be information that continues to elude you in the most frustrating of ways!   Two Basic Forms of Memory   Short term memory is also referred to as working memory. With a duration of probably less than a minute, short term memory is what allows you to remember a phone number long enough to dial it, or remember what was read in the first half of a sentence. The many types of long term memory include everything else, from your amazing ability to recite the capitals of all 50 states, to how to write your name, and where you parked your car at the mall yesterday. Memory is complicated. The amount of information that is stored in your brain is incredible, from the time you were an infant until today â everything you have heard or felt, learned or experienced; the amount is mind-boggling. The neurotransmitters that are the workhorse of the brain are aging as well: a normal process that actually begins in your 20s, but doesnât usually become apparent until your 40s.   Forgetfulness is Not a Memory Disorder   The fact is that it simply takes a little longer to process as you age. As many seniors are well aware, the ability to learn new skills is still alive and well! However, you can still process new information and continually hone those skills,  taking classes , starting new career ventures...whatever!   So, what is the benchmark for aging and normal memory loss? You may find yourself forgetting names, appointments, where you put something, or not be able to remember who told you what during a conversation. Although annoying and frustrating in turn, these incidents donât imply anything more important than the happy fact that you've made it this far!   Coping with Memory Loss and Forgetfulness   Most individuals  turning fifty  or older may find themselves continually looking for the car keys or the dog leash. Here's a few tips for coping with the change:   Keep a list: this is one of the very best ways to remind yourself of appointments, tasks you want to accomplish, even writing down someone's name on a piece of paper can help you recall it next time you see him. Consistency: Put your car keys in the same place every single time. Keep your list in the exact same place at all times â somewhere that you have easy access to it. Exercise your memory: Yep, there's evidence that it may be a case of ""use it or lose it""! Crossword puzzles, brain teasers, memory games...and don't forget a healthy diet! Relax!!! Aging and changes in memory function are normal and to be expected with age. Discuss any questions about your ability to recall information on a regular basis, or whether you may be dealing with a memory disorder or the onset of Alzheimer's with your physician.

The only way that you can be fully prepared is to study until it hurts. However, there are a few other SAT prep tips that can help you ace the test. (Note: some of these tips may seem simple, but on test day people tend to panic and forget the basics. Stay focused.)    SAT Test Centers    Make sure that you know exactly where the SAT test center is and how long it takes to get to there. Try to arrive at the test center at least 30 minutes before your SAT appointment. You will need to check in prior to taking the test. Also, do not forget to bring your SAT admission ticket and a photo ID.     Before Taking the SAT    Itâs hard to resist the temptation to stay up all night and cram for the SAT. The fact is, you will be much better off if you spend that time resting. Make sure that you get enough sleep the night before. Your brain will be better for it.   A good breakfast is not a bad thing, but make sure that you do not eat or drink too much right before the exam. You donât want to waste test-taking time because you are holed up in the bathroom.    SAT Test Taking Tips    There are many different approaches that you can use that will help you succeed on the SAT. Most importantly, prepare for the test and keep a steady head while taking it. Here are a few other SAT test-taking tips that will assist you:    Answer easy  SAT questions  first.  You donât get extra points for hard questions, so donât waste all of your time trying to work them out. In each section of the SAT, the questions start out easy and become increasingly more difficult. Get through the easiest part of the SAT first before attempting the hard questions.  Don't be afraid to guess on the SAT.  Unless you are working on a particularly difficult SAT questions, usually you can rule out one or more answers. If you are going to guess, guess smart.  Know when to skip an SAT question.  Sometimes after reading a question, you know that you will not be able to come up with an answer. Rather than spending ten minutes trying to narrow down your choices, skip the question. If you have time at the end, you can go back and have another go at it.  Use your SAT test book.

Commit to making a change            and decide to start now                        Whatever your reasons have been for not getting organized or staying            organized in the past, you can make a change, even if you only have 5            minutes a day.Â  Stop telling yourself youl get organized when you            have more time, more money, or more motivation.Â  Start now!                         Don buy anything yet             Don            buy any storage containers, shelves, drawer organizers, etc., until            youe already done some sorting and know how much storage space you            actually need (if any) for the items youe going to keep.Â  Youl            probably be able to use storage bins or shelves that you already            have.Â  If you do need to buy new storage, youl know exactly what you            need.                        DO buy some large trash bags, if you don have some already.Â  Youl            use these for collecting trash (of course) and items to donate.                        But before you roll up your sleeves and start sorting, do some            brainstorming.                         Define your vision for            the space             T hink            of three words that describe how you want your space to  look             and  feel .Â  You can write these words on a large poster board            and put them up in the room, or create you can even create a ision            boardwith inspirational pictures and words.Â  Your vision will be            your reference point to keep you on track as you work on getting            organized.                         Set limits and boundaries             This            is the key to organization.Â  Wee all limited by time, space, money,            or ability.Â  Sometimes limits are frustrating, but they can also be            empowering if you make them work for you.Â  Your house is a finite            space - it only as big as it is.Â  Maybe remodeling or adding space            is within your budget.Â  If so, that great!Â  But adding more space            won magically make you organized.                        To get organized, you have to change your habits.Â  You have to set            limits for yourself, and then respect those limits by changing your            behavior.                        What does that mean?Â  Here an example.Â  Perhaps your vision for your            kitchen is that it be a place to prepare and enjoy food and to spend            time together as a family, but instead your kitchen counters are            overflowing with paperwork.Â  This means youe not respecting your            vision for the space, or the limitations of the space.                        Set a boundary by designating an inbox or basket for incoming paper.Â             Then, respect that limit by dealing with the paperwork as soon as (or            before!) the inbox overflows.Â  In the past, you might have blown right            past the limit and let the paperwork overflow and take over the            kitchen.Â  Now, youe going to start a new habit.Â  The limit (the            borders of the inbox) is your reminder to do something different            (sort, purge, file).                        You can apply this principle to much more than paperwork.Â  It does get            tricky when you start sorting sentimental items and it's not as easy            to make decisions.Â  We all have emotional attachments to our stuff, so            we tell ourselves that we can fit more into a space than it will            realistically hold.Â  Clutter results.                        However, as organizers, we won't just come in and make you throw            things away.Â  What we will do is challenge you to stick to your            own vision about what you want from your home and your life.Â             Letting go of things that don contribute to your ideal life is an            important part of getting organized, but it also ok to keep things            that have meaning to you, even if you don use them every day.Â  We'll            help you define what you really want from your everyday living spaces,            and then we'll help you make that a reality.                         Ask yourself if each item            contributes toward your vision for your space             Your            vision words are your guideline.Â  If you want to use your living room            for family relaxation and watching TV, then it probably not the            right place for your sewing machine.                        On a smaller scale, ask yourself if items youe hanging onto are            making your life easier, or harder?Â  Are all those magazines youe            saving to read omedayreally bringing you any joy or satisfaction?Â             Or are they just getting in your way and making you feel guilty?Â             Decide what you want from the stuff youe keeping (enjoyment,            information, comfort), and if youe not getting whatever it is that            you want, consider letting the item go.                         You CAN make a difference            in a few minutes a day             If you            don have a large chunk of time to set aside for an organizing            marathon, that ok.Â  You can still tackle clutter.Â  It will take a            while though, so you have to keep up your motivation.Â  Tackle small,            unemotional projects first to create energy.Â  Start with an area that            you will really notice a difference in, like the kitchen or family            room, rather than the attic.Â  That way youl be able to enjoy the            results of your hard work and youl have more motivation and energy            for the less visible projects.   Â Starting with an area you            don't have an emotional attachment to, like the pantry, is also a good            idea.Â  Save the hard stuff, like children's artwork or childhood            keepsakes, for later when you've built up your organizing muscles.                         Use a timer            Take the time you have to work on decluttering even if it only 15            minutes and set a timer for HALF the time.Â  Sort until the timer            goes off.Â  Then set the timer again for the second half.Â  Now put away            everything that you sorted.Â  This way, youl avoid leaving piles of            sorted papers or objects that ultimately get swept back into the big            pile, undoing all your hard work.Â  If the things youe sorting don            have a home yet, take them to the room where they will ultimately            live.                        (This method often works better for stuff than for paper, although it            can work well for large categories of paper things for example,            sorting into categories of magazines, bills to pay, school papers,            receipts, etc.)                        You may have heard the nly handle it oncerule.Â  This is a great            idea, but not always practical. Â Don let it be an excuse that keeps            you from action.Â  Sometimes you may have to handle something twice or            three times (or more!) in the process of getting organized.Â  This is            much better than never handling it at all and having it sit in the            same spot for years.                         Involve the whole family             If            you share your space with others, get their input.Â  What is their            vision for the space?Â  It important that everyone be on the same            page, or youl have a hard time maintaining it.Â  And, recruit their            help in getting organized.Â  Everyone who uses the space bears some            responsibility for getting it neat and keeping it that way.Â  Even            small children can start to learn good organizing habits.Â  And yes,            even messy teens and husbands can be reformed.Â  Of course, this is            easier said than done!Â  The key is having shared goals, understanding            of basic organizing principles, and a commitment to change habits, one            little bit at a time.                        If your family really doesn want to get on board, don force the            issue there's no point in expending your valuable energy trying to            make others make a change theye not ready for.Â  Focus on the areas            you can control.Â  As your family members see the changes you make,            they may warm up to the idea of decluttering their own spaces and            shared spaces.                                     back to the top                                                         Organization is            simple, but not easy.Â              Our job is to encourage and support you.Â                          If you'd like some help implementing             these ideas,  contact us  today!                                                                             .                                                                     .

Their closets are filled with holiday gifts (bought  in April), they know exactly how many cans of tuna are in their pantry,  and they can find what they need in their home in less than a minute.  Does this describe you? If not, thatâs OK. The new year is just around  the corner and if getting your home and/or personal life organized is one of your goals for 2004 then read on. Being organized is a skill that can be learned and mastered over time. Here are some tips for âsurvivingâ the first few steps of your path to becoming organized:  â¢Â Talk to your spouse/family/roommate and tell them you will be taking steps towards getting organized. Inform them that it is important  to have their cooperation and physical/emotional support as you pursue  this endeavor. List the benefits of being organized and emphasize how your being organized will help them lead a less harried and stressful life. Tips for Organizing your Home  â¢Â Select one small area of your home that needs organizing (desk drawer, kitchen cabinet). Break down that organizing project into small and manageable tasks by listing all of the steps necessary to take in order to reach your organizing goal. Take your project one step at a time.  â¢Â Decide upon a set amount of time that you will spend organizing. In the beginning, it is best to start smallâorganizing in 15 minute increments  a day. For instance, set a kitchen timer for 15 minutes and go through  your sock drawer or your medicine cabinet. When the timer goes off, you  can decide to complete the task or save it for another 15-minute block of time. As you become more comfortable with organizing and making decisions  about your clutter, increase the time to 30 min or longer. Or, use your favorite CD as your timer and organize to the music. When the CD is doneâso are you...  â¢Â Take breaks often. Trying to organize for hours on end will  leave you frustrated, exhausted, and unable to appreciate the fruits of your labor. Organizing is a very physically and emotionally taxing activity. Step away from the task for a few minutes--watch TV, read the mail or call a friend. Youâll come back to your project refreshed and ready to accomplish your organizing goals. Tips for Organizing Your Personal Life  â¢Â Select a paper or electronic planner/calendar for 2004. Using  one will help you  to keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, appointments, and activities.  â¢Create goals for 2004 and think about the activities you need to engage in to reach those goals. Make reaching your goals a priority in your life by scheduling these activities in your calendar before all others.  â¢Â Simplify tasks so they become shorter and easier. Examples:  Fill your pantry with non-perishables (requires fewer last-minute trips  to the supermarket), create a mix-and-match wardrobe (saves time in the  morning and money at the dry cleaner), create a packing list for traveling  (print it out every time you travel instead of recreating it for every trip).  â¢Â Delegate tasks that are unpleasant or that take you away from  reaching your goals. You donât have to do it all... Two âDonâtsâ  â¢Â Donât get discouraged. Whether itâs your home or your personal life youâre trying to organize, keep smilinâ and working towards your goal.  Itâs easy to throw in the towel when you donât see immediate progress being  made  â¢Â Donât forget to reward yourself for your accomplishments. After sorting through your file cabinet or purging your to-do list, take a few moments to sit, relax, and contemplate how far youâve come since you made your resolution to get organized.

The idea is to get others to like you so they will hire you directly or refer you to their friends. The sooner you build good relationships, the sooner you'll be hired, and the words ""thank you"" create good will.    The best marketing letter in the world is one that simply says ""Thank you, I appreciate you."" There's no more powerful appeal. No one grows tired of being thanked.    Any thank you is appreciated, but it's even more powerful to thank others unexpectedly. I often invite prospective customers to lunchâthen send them a thank you for attending! That gets their attention. Sometimes I send books as sales gifts, and I always enclose some kind of thank you.    Use handwritten notes only for a few short sentences. Buy plain stationery, nothing fancy. Keep it businesslike. Cards that fold to 3.5"" x 5"" are ideal. Make sure your handwriting is easy-to-read. If it isn't, type the words so they're legible.    If your thoughts won't fit on a card, use a typewrittenânot handwrittenâletter. Letters must be professionally typewritten or word  processedâno exceptions. Long, rambling, hard-to-read thank you notes create more frustration than good will.    A thank-you letter is often a sales letter in disguise, so don't be afraid to put some ""sell"" into it. Send warm thanks to everyone who gives you any kind of help in the job search, however small. No exceptions. No excuses.                                                                +1/303/790-0505 : copyright 1996-2008 William S.

We all have spent most         formative years of our lives with our mothers and shared all joy and         sorrows. Such is the greatness of our mom that she always tries to make         us feel happy even in times of distress. This occasion of Mother's Day         would become more enjoyable if we add some flavor of humor to it.                      ""The hand that rocks the cradle usually is attached to someone who         isn't getting enough sleep."" - John Fiebig                      ""I'd like to be the ideal mother, but I'm too busy raising my         kids."" - Unknown                      The mother of three notoriously unruly youngsters was asked whether or         not she'd have children if she had it to do over again. ""Yes,""         she replied. ""But not the same ones."" - David Finkelstein                               A little boy forgot his lines in a Sunday school presentation. His         mother was in the front row to prompt him. She gestured and formed the         words silently with her lips, but it did not help. Her son's memory was         blank. Finally, she leaned forward and whispered the cue, ""I am the         light of the world."" The child beamed and with great feeling and a         loud clear voice said, ""My mother is the light of the world.""          - Bits and Pieces, 1989                        A teacher gave her class of second graders a lesson on the magnet and         what it does. The next day in a written test, she included this         question: ""My full name has six letters. The first one is M. I pick         up things. What am I?"" When the test papers were turned in, the         teacher was astonished to find that almost 50 percent of the students         answered the question with the word Mother - Unknown           My           Mother Taught Me           Stages           of Motherhood           You           are really a Mom When                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mother's           Day Crafts Â Â  Holiday           Resources Â Â  Recipes Â Â  Songs Â Â  Zodiac Â Â  Quotes                     Â©  Day           For Mothers.com Â Â                                  "

The early Christians celebrated the Mother's         festival on the fourth Sunday of Lent to honor Mary, the mother of         Christ. Interestingly, later on a religious order stretched the holiday         to include all mothers, and named it as the Mothering Sunday. The         English colonists settled in America discontinued the tradition of         Mothering Sunday because of lack of time. In 1872 Julia Ward Howe         organized a day for mothers dedicated to peace. It is a landmark in the         history of Mother's Day.                      In 1907, Anna M. Jarvis (1864-1948), a Philadelphia schoolteacher,         began a movement to set up a national Mother's Day in honor of her         mother, Ann Maria Reeves Jarvis. She solicited the help of hundreds of         legislators and prominent businessmen to create a special day to honor         mothers. The first Mother's Day observance was a church service honoring         Anna's mother. Anna handed out her mother's favorite flowers, the white         incarnations, on the occasion as they represent sweetness, purity, and         patience. Anna's hard work finally paid off in the year 1914, when         President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second Sunday in May as a         national holiday in honor of mothers.                       Slowly and gradually the Mother's day became very popular and gift         giving activity increased. All this commercialization of the Mother's         day infuriated Anna as she believed that the day's sentiment was being         sacrificed at the expense of greed and profit.                      Regardless of Jarvis's worries, Mother's Day has flourished in the         United States. Actually, the second Sunday of May has become the most         popular day of the year. Although Anna may not be with us but the         Mother's day lives on and has spread to various countries of the world.         Many countries throughout the world celebrate Mother's Day at various         times during the year, but some such as Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey,         Australia, and Belgium also celebrate Mother's Day on the second Sunday         of May.

Here, we will have a quick look at some of the         mothers, who have created history in their own way.                                 Alice           Waters  is credited with creating the world famous Edible         Schoolyard Project.                      Anna           Jarvis , the Founder of Mother's Day, dedicated her life to her         mother's cause and lifework and to establish Mother's Day to ""honor         mothers, living and dead....""                       Harriet           Tubman  was a colored woman born into slavery and in spite of         physical handicap and lack of education, dedicated her life to gain         freedom and save the lives of millions of people like her.                      Mother           Teresa  is certainly one of the most famous mothers, who worked         on behalf of Calcutta's poor, lepers and downtrodden for decades.                      Mother Earth , perhaps the most extensively known and famous         mother is Mother Earth. The notion of Mother Earth arose centuries ago         in Greece. In the 7th century BC,  Gaea  was the name given to the         Mother earth by the poet Hesiod. It was believed that she gave birth to         the sky, sea, and mountains and the ruling gods called the Titans. A few         centuries afterwards, Rhea, the daughter of Gaea was honored every year.
