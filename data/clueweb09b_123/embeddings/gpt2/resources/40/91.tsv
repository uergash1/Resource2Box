You're                                       here because of your interest in building                                       and owning an earth-wall home. Your questions                                       probably center around, "" will it                                       work in my climate?  "", "" can                                       I do it?  "", "" how do I                                       begin?  "" or "" how much                                       will it cost?  "" This site exists                                       to answer these questions and to get you                                       started. Here are the main considerations...                                    THE                                       CODES ...Adobe is defined in the current International Building Codes, used across the United States. Individual states, such as New Mexico, Arizona and California, modify this code to fit their building practices. Pressed Block and Rammed Earth are generally included in these codes, which can also be modified by individual counties and cities. Adobe was often a leeperin previous codes, but with the new interest in green building, bureaucrats and legislators are eager to bring it forward and work is underway to write it into ASTM standards.                                  So                                     yes, you can do it, legally speaking. In                                     areas without codes, you have more freedom,                                     but you should still build to a recognized                                     standard. If your building department has                                     little experience with earth walls, they                                     may require that your plans be                                                             -1-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       An                                     Adobe home near Santa Fe, NM                            Mark Chalom, architect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              stamped                                     by a licensed  engineer                                     or                                                               architect.

Tips & interesting information for the    traveller in South Africa:    Tipping is common practice in South Africa for a range of services.    In restaurants the accepted standard is around 10% of the bill, although sometimes    a gratuity will be included in the bill (often in the case of a large party).        Petrol stations are manned by attendants who will expect a tip of two or three    rands for filling up with petrol, checking oil, water and tyre pressure and    cleaning windscreens. Hotel porters should be tipped two to five rands. It is    also appropriate to tip taxi drivers, tour guides.    If you park a car in a populated area such as near a shopping centre, street    security guards will usually ask whether they can watch over your car and in    return should be paid a small fee - anything from two rands, a maximum of three    rands.

It borders every other country of the continent except Chile and Ecuador.    Brazil is very much a country of contrasts. When someone hears the word Brazil, one thinks of the great Amazon forest, fantastic beaches, great soccer players, Carnival time - and that's all. Well, Brazil, the most important country in South America, certainly has MUCH more to offer - warm people, great cities with everything from slums to high technology, a wide range of weather patterns, an awesome mixture of cultures and races - and much more!               BRAZIL TRAVEL INFO           Share your photos           Hotels in Brazil           Maps of Brazil           Brazil forum           Brazil destinations           Best of Brazil           Brazil Real Estate            The most visited places in Brazil includes Fernando de Noronha Island, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (the two bustling megacities of the south-east), the more relaxed city of Salvador in the northeast, or the old colonial towns of Ouro Preto and Olinda. For natural beauty, try a visit to Iguacu Falls. If you have the chance the best time to visit is Carnival.   There is nothing in the whole wide world like Carnival in Rio. Brasilia, the capital city of the country, is known by its great architecture. It is a planned city.   The most up-and-coming resort in Brazil is now the small friendly Praia de Pipa, in the NE of the country; serviced by international airports at Natal and Recife, this small town is popular with both Brazilians and foreign tourists. The laid back attitude of the open and friendly locals make this a welcome change to some of the more recognised but less safe and inviting destinations.   In Southern Brazil you can visit the state of Santa Catarina, which is visited every year by people who prefer not too crowded spots like major cities or places where all tourists go. Small beaches like Mariscal, Garopaba, Taquaras or Estaleiro beach are not too far away from medium size cities, so they provide all necessary structure, but at the same time still conserve their natural enchantments. Praia do Pinho (close to Balneario Camboriu - the most important touristic spot in southern Brazil) is the paradise for naturists as it is the first official nude beach in Brazil (http://www.praiadopinho.com.br). Many options of adventure activities such as rafting, diving, fishing, trekking are aso available in this beautiful region.              BRAZIL DESTINATIONS                   Sao Paulo Travel guide  Its history extends back for over four centuries...

Our first President, George Washington, said that his mother was ""the most beautiful woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother."" America owes much of its goodness and strength to mothers, including adoptive mothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers.      Mother's Day began as a day of love and friendship, designed to help heal families divided across battle lines during the Civil War. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson signed a resolution officially establishing Mother's Day to honor the role of women in the family. On Mother's Day, 2003, we carry on the tradition by recognizing our mothers for their strength and compassion. We also recognize them for showing unconditional love and teaching positive values.      Mothers nurture a child's physical and emotional growth, nurse illness, ease failure, and cheer success. They instill important values in children and help provide the tools they need to make the right choices and grow up to be responsible, compassionate, and successful members of society.      As we honor our mothers on this special day, we celebrate their contributions to the character of our next generation of leaders. And we remember the lessons our mothers have taught us: That it is better to give than to receive, that we must love our neighbors as ourselves, and that service to others brings joy.      The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914, as amended (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as ""Mother's Day"" and has requested the President to call for its appropriate observance. It is my honor and privilege to do so again.      NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 11, 2003, as Mother's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their love, respect, and appreciation to mothers everywhere for their contributions to their children, families, communities, and our Nation. I also call upon citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Readers'          Submissions           Planes          and Desires  ( November 23, 2004 ) by Sven           Islamabad to Peshawar to Kabul           ( February 19, 2004 )             I Try to Be a Refugee Advocate           ( November 17, 2003 )            I Wasn't Going to Afghanistan  ( November 11, 2003 )                                                                       Afghanistan               No sooner had the US begun its bombing                campaign in 2001 did I decide that sometime soon I'd make it to                Afghanistan. Not having the kind of funding needed to get in early                when the country was still at the forefront of the world's attention                my opportunity would have to wait until May 2003, more than eighteen                months after the world began to forget about Afghanistan.               Today it's once again a forgotten backwater.                The world's focus is now on Iraq, SARS, some kind of road map about                peace in the Middle East, and a host of other things that don't                involve Afghanistan. Apparently, if Afghanistan is going to get                some international attention it will cost the lives of a few ISAF                personnel to get it. That is very disturbing.               Promises of aid and security have been                made. Few have been kept. Violence is on the rise. Stability is                on the wane. Security is deteriorating. A handful of tourists have                trickled in, mostly Japanese, finding a war-torn country desperate                for normalcy and mostly quite welcoming to these few intrepid folks                that make the effort to visit.               The stories in this section chronicle                my brief visit which lasted from May 12 - May 24, 2003. The three                sections: Kabul, Bamiyan, and Mazar-e-Sharif chronicle my travels                to and around each of these places, while the Practical Matters                section provides some useful travel information.               Note: The stories and information in this section dates from May 2003 and some things may be different now.
