In his January 1999 State of the Union Address the   President stated that ""we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social   Security can earn."" The House and Senate responded to his call, passing   unanimous legislation that will usher in a new era of opportunity for   America’s senior citizens.           Eliminating the Retirement Earnings Test for People Above the     Normal Retirement Age.  Under current law, if seniors continue to work from     the normal retirement age (currently 65) to age 70, they can have some of their     Social Security benefits withheld. This year, Social Security benefits are     reduced $1 for every $3 earned above $17,000. The withheld benefits are then     returned, in general with interest, in the form of higher benefits after     stopping work, or at age 70. H.R. 5 fully eliminates this confusing and     outdated retirement earnings test for people above the normal retirement age,     allowing them to keep their full Social Security benefits regardless of their     earnings level.                       900,000 People Will Benefit This Year . About 900,000 people     will benefit from this legislation this year (this includes about 800,000     workers and about 100,000 spouses and dependents). People who have had benefits     withheld this year will have them returned in full in their May Social Security     checks.                       Will Encourage More Senior Citizens to Work . This year there     are 9.6 million people between the ages of 65 and 69, of which 3.0 million work     in Social Security covered employment. By 2030, the number of people in this     age group will double to 20.3 million. Eliminating the retirement earnings test     will ensure that healthy senior citizens who want to work can work without     confusing impediments. This is an important step toward preparing the American     economy for the demographic challenge of the baby boom.  The most definitive     study on the Retirement Earnings Test – by economist Leora Friedberg     – found that eliminating the retirement earnings test would cause a 5.3     percent increase in work hours by those affected.                       Paid For Over the Long Run and Thus a Negligible Effect on Social     Security Solvency . Although eliminating the Retirement Earnings Test has a     cost over the next decade, in subsequent decades this cost is fully repaid     – with interest. According to the Social Security actuaries, eliminating     the retirement earnings test will not change the projected exhaustion date for     the Social Security trust funds – 2037 – and it has a ""negligible""     effect on the long-term solvency of Social Security.           President Clinton Has a Fiscally Responsible Plan to Extend the   Solvency of Social Security.  Eliminating the Retirement Earnings Test will   help build bipartisan trust toward working with Congress to extend the life of   Social Security. The President believes that more should be done to extend the   life of Social Security until the middle of the century and strengthen the   benefits for elderly women. The President has proposed a specific plan that   would ensure that the benefits of the debt reduction that are due to Social   Security are used to extend the life of Social Security and pay down the debt   held by the public by 2013:           Keeping Social Security surpluses for Social Security .     The President proposes to lock away all of the Social Security surplus, a step     that would pay down debt and prepare the government, and the Nation, for the     retirement of the baby boomers.                Social Security solvency and debt reduction transfers .     After a decade of debt reduction, the President’s plan earmarks the     interest savings resulting from this debt reduction to the Social Security     Trust Fund. By themselves, these fiscally prudent steps will pay down the     government debt, reduce interest payments in the future, and provide resources     to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund to at least 2054. In     contrast, the Republican so-called lockboxes would not extend the life of     Social Security by a single day.                  New Tools to Help Retirement Planning. The President also announces that   Social Security is releasing a new Social Security Retirement Planner. This is   an Internet-based application that will allow workers to obtain estimates of   their Social Security benefits based on their past and expected future earnings   and other plans. Social Security is the foundation for a secure retirement, but   for most people a comfortable retirement rests on the three-legged financial   stool of Social Security, pensions, and savings. The new financial planner will   enable people to take advantage of the tools of the Internet economy to plan   their pensions and private savings to ensure that they enjoy a dignified   retirement. (Note: to maintain privacy and protect records from unauthorized   users, none of the calculators are linked to individual earnings records or any   other information in SSA’s database. All benefit estimates are based   strictly on input from the users.)

GX010-55-3898623	"Chapter Three:   The Trauma Response: External Factors     I. Sensory Inputs from Event        The nature of sensory information and its strength when people encounter a  traumatic event may relate both to the developmental stage of the individuals as well as previous  life experience.  For instance, a small child may react more to a sense of smell than an  adult because the olfactory senses develop first in the growth of brain structures.  For  most adults, the visual or auditory senses are the strongest initial perceptions, but visual  perceptions are often critical to the eventual formation of a narrative.                Seeing apparently dominates all other senses following trauma because it is  the sense by which most horrible episodes are recorded and reviewed in the mind.   Traumatic ""tapes"" are almost always replayed by victims in silent video _ not in  audio or even in ""smellovision.""  Even in cases where a traumatic episode begins in  an entirely blinded way … the event may eventually transform itself into ""sight.""              _ Terr,  Too Scared to Cry.            The immediate impact of sensory information is affected by the proximity of an  individual to the trauma.  It is also affected by prior experience.  If a particular taste,  smell, touch, sight or sound has previously been associated with threat and danger, the  neuronal connection is already established and it is reactivated by the current experience.  It is  likely that repeated exposure to such threat will both increase sensitization to the sensory  information as well as mute response.       Since the senses are the primary source of information, they become the foundation  for memory of what happened.    II.      Chronology of the Event and the Individual's Participation in  the Chronology          Understanding the perception of time and its relation to trauma reactions is  crucial since the sense of time helps the brain organize and transcribe feelings and thoughts.                Fitting a frightening event into ""time,"" either personal time or world time,  helps a person to cope with that event.  Seeing, furthermore, how sequences of events  work together and how long events will last also helps prevent any flooding of the psyche.   Feeling rhythms, in addition, helps maintain a person's sense of balance.  If all of  these time awarenesses fail, however, to prevent a person from becoming traumatized,  the person's time sense will undergo some damage. … As a ""stimulus barrier,"" in  other words, time functions both as a protection against damage and as a marker of  the damage.             _ Terr,  Too Scared to Cry.        The use of chronology to form a cognitive narrative for a story of events is helpful  to victims.  It is also helpful if they can comprehend the circumstances of the event and  their involvement in it as they seek order and meaning in their world.  It is useful for crisis  responders to try to sort out the stages of the event and the roles that victims played in  the event as they listen to victims' stories.  Some of the issues associated with the  chronological recounting of the story will involve the following stages of disaster as interpreted by  individuals and the community:     A.      Pre-disaster equilibrium             The community equilibrium before a disaster is defined by cultural transitions  or tensions, previous disaster history, or political, economic, or historical tensions.   That equilibrium and the effect of stressors on it is similar to that of an individual.   The pre-disaster equilibrium has been established as a balance between  existing stressors and the adaptive capacity of a community to such stressors.      B.      Warning and threat             These stages for all intents and purposes often are merged in our understanding.   Certainly they may be experienced differently by different people.  However,  objectively, there is a distinct difference.  The warning period is characterized by  anxiety, wariness, and wonder.  There may be excitement tempered by high vigilance.   Post-disaster reactions to what happened during this period may  involve concerns of evacuation and shelter.            Most communities experience warnings of potential disasters on a regular basis.   Tornado warnings, flood warnings, and hurricane warnings are all a part of  continuing community life in many parts of the country.  If individuals or communities  experience such warnings, they develop plans of action for evacuation, shelter, or  care in the event of a disaster.  They also experience a growing acceptance of the  warnings and a gradual denial of the imminence of the disaster.  That denial is  exacerbated when the community or individual has more immediate needs _ financial,  emotional, or political.              Repeated warnings along with sporadic impacts of a certain kind of event  often are the foundation of a ""disaster subculture.""  Disaster subcultures emerge  when there have been repetitive disaster impacts, periodic warnings of disaster, and  the community's knowledge and recognition of consequential damage from the  disaster event.            Many individuals who live in disaster subcultures cope in the aftermath of the  impact of a ""predictable"" disaster by relying upon their cognitive  understanding that they had a choice in whether to live in the area or not.  Recognition of  pre-disaster choices made on an assessment of the risks can ameliorate stress and help to  define future action.            In disaster subcultures, organizational elements of a community may provide  a degree of effective prediction, control, and response.  However,  individual alarm systems may have been weakened by denial, lack of interest, or competing  anxieties or concerns.  This was illustrated in the disaster in Aberfan, Wales, on October  21, 1966, when 140,000 cubic yards of colliery rubbish swept down Methyr  Mountain and killed 116 children, 5 teachers, 23 other adults, injured 35 people, and  destroyed two schools and many houses.  The village had noted changes in the slag pile  days before the disaster and there had been warnings over the course of 40 years prior  to the catastrophe.              Since the village was dependent economically on the Aberfan mine, there was  an element of willful blindness in refraining from taking extra safety measures.   There appeared to be a greater anxiety about the thought of losing jobs than from  some contingent fear of disaster.             _ Howe, ""The Aberfan Disaster,""   Medico-Legal Journal , 1968.                Examples of disaster subcultures include the following.  •     Israel: This description depicts the reaction of a family returning to the  United States for a visit after moving to Israel.  Israel is often besieged by violent  acts, but it is significant that in many cases, its citizens have chosen to reside there  and have accommodated the threats of such violence through a disaster subculture  of attitudes, behaviors, and norms.                The Rosenfelds have reached the Mall intact.  They are eating popcorn as  they amble towards the National Museum of History.  One of the children goes over to  a trash can and looks inside before depositing the empty          popcorn cup.  An identical carton litters the path.  The child eyes it and leaves it  there, earning a disdainful glare from a passerby who demonstratively picks it up and  tosses it into the trash.  The child immediately hangs her head and brings her right  shoulder up in a decidedly foreign gesture, holding this pose for a count of three.  This is  the defensive posture of an unrepentant Israeli child of any ethnic background who  is confronted by an accusing adult.  In this case it is the body language of a kid who  would no more handle a discarded popcorn cup _ or pick up a wallet on the street or kick  a Pepsi can whose chain of custody has not been established _ than she would  accept a ride from a passing stranger with a pocketful of candy. … Sure, it's a war mentality.   Coping with unremitting violence carries a heavy cost.  But, looking back, I feel  that we adjusted to terror better than we knew.  We opened our handbags and turned  out our pockets before we entered public places and we got used to the sight of  middle-aged druggists or lawyers in the uniforms of civil guard patrol.

Such a disaster subculture may compound feelings of anger or guilt by  survivors after a disaster hits even as it also makes them less responsive to warnings of threat.    Planners developing action guides for responding to such threats should know  some of the pitfalls in communicating with disaster subcultures.            What makes a warning credible?  First, warning messages need to identify  the source of the information contained in the warning and include a mixture of  references such as public officials, scientists, or experts in the field of disaster.  These  messages will be perceived as more relevant than others because of the source of the message.   Second, it is useful to warn people through multiple communication channels.   Seeing a warning on television is confirmed by hearing a warning on the radio or  reading about a warning in the newspaper _ it involves different sensory perceptions at  different times.  Third, the content of the warning should include a description of what  is going to happen, where the danger exists, and how severe the potential impact may  be. This helps the mind put the threat into an organized cognition.  Finally,  warnings should provide descriptions of specific and simple protective measures that those  in risk may use to protect themselves.              Threat occurs when warning involves knowledge of imminent danger and  potential death.  Threat may last for brief moments or hours of time.  Many people  experience the impact of the disaster itself in the pre-impact stage of threat.  Their reactions  are triggered by the threat even when the feared threat does not occur.  Hence, it is  important to understand those reactions, the impact of appraisal of threats and coping  responses.            Today's understandings of the role of appraisal of threats and ultimate coping  strategies still rests significantly on the theories developed by Lazarus and Folkman  (New York: Springer Publishing) in 1984.  In their book,   Stress, Appraisal and Coping,  they define coping as ""...constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to  manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding  the resources of the person...""  This definition fits well within the Maslow Model of  response to trauma in Chapter One.  While these coping or stress responses are  examined in more detail below, the significance of the appraisal itself on the ultimate  coping responses has been studied relatively little.            Lazarus and Folkman write about cognitive appraisals that determine, first, if  events are relevant, benefits to the individual, or stressors.  Stressors are defined as  threats, losses, or challenges.  What studies have been done seem to suggest that people  responding to loss rely upon emotional coping skills such as expression of feelings  and social support; individuals responding to threats may rely upon wishful thinking or  religious coping skills such as wanting to be over what happened, believing that  things can return to normal, or relying upon God or faith for help; and those responding  to challenging situations focus on problem-solving or optimism, such as action  planning or looking for positive outcomes of the stress.  (McCrae, R.R., ""Situational  determinants of coping responses: Loss, threat, and challenge,""   Journal of Personality and Social  Psychology , 1984; Bjorck, J.P., & Cohen, L.H., ""Coping with threats,  losses and challenges,""  Journal of Social and Clinical  Psychology , 1993; Bjorck, J.P., & Klewicki, L.L., ""The Effects of Stressor Type on Projected Coping"",   Journal of Traumatic Stress Studies , July, 1997).              These distinctions in the impact of the appraisals of stress and the possible  combination in disasters of cumulative appraisals of loss, threat and challenge may be  interesting considerations in responding to survivors after an event.  Responders  may want to try to understand the retrospective perceptions by survivors of their  appraisal of the potential catastrophe prior to impact.            The study of these stress responses has increased markedly over the last decade.   Several patterns have been identified.            There is the emotion-focused response strategy, the problem-focused  response strategy, and an avoidance or disengagement strategy.  The latter strategy may  incorporate both of the other strategies.              The  emotion-focused  strategy may be the most efficient in what is perceived  as uncontrollable circumstances.  It is an attempt to reduce or eliminate the  emotional distress caused by the situation.  However, some studies suggest that while this  may be the most effective way to handle immediate emergencies where individuals  feel powerless, it may also put  the survivors at higher risk for long-term trauma.              The  problem-focused  strategy aims at removing the source of the threat.  It is  usually employed by individuals who see some latitude that allows for considering  options and taking action.  Such individuals often are able to integrate what happened  in the disaster more quickly into their life story since their actions helped them make  a productive transition through the catastrophe to the present.               Disengagement  may be a process that allows the survivors to take a break  from the threat while beginning to plan for problem-focused responses in the future.   At times, this has been called ""blunting.""  It may be associated with the release of  opiates in the brain and the mediating effect of serotonin in monitoring stress hormones.   It is manifested at times in denial of the event or the event's impact.  Blunting may  be an alternative coping mechanism to an emotion-focused strategy, but may also  put survivors at higher risk for long-term stress reactions.            A study of coping responses among Israeli University students was made  during the 1991 Gulf War.  The students were given a warning period of one-and-a-half  minutes, during which they fled into a sealed room and stayed there while Scud  missiles, possibly carrying deadly  chemical agents, attacked.  Three sets of coping  activities observed.              The  instrumental  response _ involving communicating with others, safety  checks with each other, and helping others _ were most common.  An   emotional  response _ feeling tense, trembling, or asking for a hug _ was the next most common.  Almost  as common was the  blunting  response, defined as making fun of the situation or  thinking of pleasant things.  The latter two responses did not correlate with the  instrumental response, and it is suggested that the instrumental response was implemented  first and that, after everything was done that could be done, the other response  options kicked in.  (Klingman, Avigdor, & Kuper-mintz, Hagai, ""Response Style and  Self-Control Under Scud Missile Attacks:  The Case of the Sealed Room Situation  During the 1991 Gulf War,""  Journal of Traumatic  Stress , July, 1994)            These response studies to the threat of imminent danger are helpful because  they also relate to coping behaviors in the aftermath as control of the situation  becomes more possible.            Community crisis responders have an obligation to help communities be  prepared and vigilant about potential disaster.  This means developing the skills and tools  with which to respond when a disaster occurs; educating community members on  crisis and trauma reactions;  as well as developing a disaster plan for providing  appropriate emotional aftercare.     C.      Impact   1.      Timing            Many victims and survivors think in retrospect that they had no warning of  the danger.  While this may be true, often such people simply do not comprehend  the danger because the shock is so overwhelming and the timing of the threat adds  to its unreality.  For instance, when awoken from sleep, people may not be ready  to respond appropriately.  The suddenness of sleep interruption may cause them  to feel even more isolated.  The abrupt departure from routine may also cause  a mental shock wave when a disaster occurs.   2.      Time warp            The effect of trauma on one's sense of time is dramatic.  While animals  have an innate knowledge of time, it seems to relate to the sense of light and degree  of temperature such that they develop routines based upon when they can hunt,  migrate, sleep, hibernate, or mate.  In the human species, the sense of time  extends itself through a knowledge of past, present and future in a linear extension that  not only includes comprehension of history but a projection of a future.  This  sense of time is refined developmentally as it becomes correlated with motion,  rhythm, and, eventually, ""clock time.""            When a traumatic event occurs, the ""clock time"" seems to cease and  traumatized individuals go through a time warp.  At impact, victims often feel time stops.   Mariann Hybels-Steer recalled a beating in a riot in the following way:                I don't know how long it lasted.  It seemed fast.  It seemed slow.  It seemed like  the blink of an eye.  It seemed like an eternity.  Time compressed.  Time elongated.             _ Hybels-Steer, M.,   Aftermath _ Survive and Overcome Trauma , Simon &  Schuster, 1995.                When the sense of time resumes, it usually is experienced as if life were  progressing in slow motion or at an extremely fast pace.  The less control a  person has during the crisis, the more likely that the crisis will be perceived as lasting  a long time.  The more control someone has, the more likely that the crisis will  be compacted into what is perceived as a brief moment or moments of reaction.            In order to unravel the happening of an event, survivors must try to fit  the event into a time sequence.  A chronology seems to help individuals protect  themselves against the extent of damage caused by the trauma.  If time seems to  stop, the cessation seems to allow the mind to be inundated by perception and to  stop the mind's ability to comprehend the event.  The perceptions, however, may  become vividly imprinted in traumatic memory.            The understanding of time includes senses of rhythm, duration, sequence,  and perspective.  These senses help to order life.  When the these senses are  suspended, people may also stop adhering to everyday routines (usually governed  by time) and rules or laws.  If everything is perceived as chaos or as operating in  a vacuum, why continue to obey order?  Survivors are in an unreal but  animated state.  Time is suspended, as are normality, rules, and laws.  One is no longer  accountable to the previous social structure because that structure no longer exists.              There are practical aspects to this and there are moral aspects:  •     Practical aspects: not going to work on time, social routines being  disrupted, experiencing a coma-like state which is accompanied by temporary  amnesic blanks in memory and understanding; losing sense of hours, days, and weeks.  •     Moral aspects: the suspension of rules, laws, and order may contribute to  the rise in violence during or after the disaster.  Voyeurs or looters may see  nothing wrong in trespassing and stealing if everything is destroyed already.   Sexual assault and rape may be accepted as normal.  Murder may not be illegal  but mandatory under certain circumstances.                For the common soldier … war has the feel _ the spiritual texture _ of a great  ghostly fog, thick and permanent.  There is no clarity.  Everything swirls.  The old rules are  no longer binding, the old truths no longer true.  Right spills over into wrong.  Order  blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law into anarchy, civility into savagery.   The vapors suck you in.  You can't tell where you are, or why you're there, and the  only certainty is overwhelming ambiguity.  In war you lose your sense of the definite,  hence your sense of truth itself, and therefore it's safe to say that in a true war story  nothing is ever absolutely true.             _ Tim O'Brien, combat veteran, ""The Things They Carried,"" 1990 in   Trauma and Recovery , Herman, J., 1992.      3.      Duration of the event            Even as the perception of time is distorted, the actual time elapsed during  the impact of the event on the sensory perceptions, emotional and cognitive  brain structures, and community will affect the severity of the trauma reaction.   The longer that any of the following periods last, the greater the intensity of the  experience of crisis.  •     Duration of immediate life-threatening event.            The quicker one is removed from the threat and emotions are calmed,  the less likely that the event will remain worrisome.  There may remain an  emotional memory of the event and the fear or anger that was caused, but that  trace may not have solidified into chemical or hormonal changes in the brain  messaging system.   •     Duration of ongoing survival concerns.            Even if the immediate threat has been removed, if survivors are left in a  state where they continue to feel that their or their loved ones' lives are threatened  by ongoing danger, they may continue to associate and reassociate the event  with danger.  •     Duration of sensorial involvement.            Threat may be reduced and survival may be assured, but the longer  survivors are in contact with sensory information that reminds them of the event, the  more likely they will integrate those reminders with their emotional map of the trauma.  •     Duration of morbid preoccupation by a community.            The impact of a community's  response to the event can exacerbate  anxieties and trauma reactions.  People look to their society and their culture to  confirm or deny what has occurred.  When a community is traumatized, the  communal entity tends to process the crisis in a similar way to each individual but the  crisis reaction is multiplied exponentially by each member's experience.  If the  community dwells on the trauma as an aberration from communal life and does  not seek to integrate it into its history, or if a community reprocesses the  traumatic reaction over and over without developing a strategy for the future, individuals  in the community may have their own trauma elongated by a lack of support or  understanding of the need to continue to function and grow.  On the other hand,  if the community acknowledges the event and the trauma, and assists individuals  in connecting with each other and finding meaning to the event, people are  often able to successfully survive and thrive.     4. Low point  versus  no low point issues            There is a point in time in most disasters when one can assess the total  casualties or damage.  That may be referred to as the low point of the disaster.  However,  for certain types of disasters, such as health epidemics, environmental spills,  chemical or nuclear accidents, it may be impossible to assess the total damage during a  lifetime.  Such disasters are referred to as ""no low point disasters.""  They have a  beginning _ the sudden knowledge of threat or danger, and they have a middle, the  ongoing upheaval caused by the chronic threat.  They don't have a foreseeable end.            Examples of no low-point disasters include the plague in Europe when  from 1347-1400 over one-third of Europe's population died; the current HIV/AIDS  epidemic; the Three Mile Island nuclear accident; and the Exxon-Valdez oil spill.              The nuclear explosion at Chernobyl in Russia is a similar disaster.  Its  long-term damage and effects are illustrated in the following:                ""…how harmful will chronic radiation prove to be?  There are many indications  that steady low-level doses of increased radiation have a cumulative effect on cells  and chromosomes.  Only time _ and generations _ will      reveal what damage  Chernobyl really caused.… Life      itself will be the evidence,"" said Dr. Alexander Urinan, a  surgeon I visited at Kiev's Children Hospital Number 14.  ""Seven years after the accident,  we're now starting to observe the effects we feared.""  Urinan confirmed that thyroid  cancers in Ukraine and Belarus, especially among the children who received a dose of  radioactive iodine from the initial blast, have far surpassed the numbers predicted.  It is also  clear that the immune systems of many children of Chernobyl, even those born far from  the  reactor, have become so depressed that old diseases like diphtheria are now  reappearing.  ""We're seeing newborn children with liver and stomach cancers,"" Urinan said.   The hospital has also reported record numbers of babies born with cleft  palates, deformed limbs, and missing rectums.  ""We can't tell what to expect when  affected children who are now adolescents begin to give birth … ""             ~~ [Need end and citation _ Smithsonian]               Kai Erikson refers to the special trauma of such catastrophes as a trauma  that is inculcated with ""dread."" (Erikson, K., ""Toxic Reckoning: Business Faces  a New Kind of Fear,""   Harvard Business  Review , January-February, 1990)            With low point disasters, there is a point when people know that things can  get better.  They can describe the worst.  They can complete their story and  develop their truth.  In no-low point disasters, anger vacillates to outrage, back to anger,  to repressed anger, and simulated apathy.  It may never subside.  Fear is a  constant _ dread haunts the survivor's life.  The question is how to learn to cope with  constant fear instead of how to reestablish a sense of safety.     D.      Inventory             The inventory stage of a disaster takes place immediately after the initial impact.   Survivors who have been the victim of sudden, immediate trauma often experience  a period of time in which there is silence.  The silence is usually deceptive.   Observers at a disaster scene may witness the noise of ambulances or natural forces, but  the survivors and responders to the disaster may hear nothing.             ""There were little bodies in piles dotted around the room and items of  children's clothing like shoes around the floor,"" said the first ambulance man to reach  Dunblane Primary School.  ""The strange thing was the virtual silence that we encountered as  we walked in.  Children were just sitting there in total shock with bullet wounds to  their limbs and bodies, unable to cry out or speak.""             ~~[Need citation ]Dunblane (population 9,000), Scotland, March 13, 1996 -  Massacre in which 16 students and their teacher were killed.                This state of silence compounds the sense of isolation and abandonment  that many victims experience in the midst of tragedy.  Their disorientation is increased  if the result of the catastrophe is darkness or it takes place in darkness.   Individuals need to have affirmation that the tragedy has happened and that they are still  connected to the world.            The inventory stage is also the time when survivors make their first assessment  of the amount of harm that has occurred.  The usual progression of assessment is  to find out whether they are injured, whether loved ones are injured or dead, and the  extent of property damage or loss.  First responders and survivors are often in the  position of making immediate triage decisions at the scene.  Afterwards, they may  discover ""mistakes"" made about who, when and how to rescue.  These discoveries  may be the cause of additional guilt, self-blame, depression, or anguish.  The  inventory may extend into stages of rescue and remedy.  This is particularly true of no  low-point disasters.            Richard Williams is the buildings manager for the Federal offices here  [Oklahoma City], and he was in the Federal Building when the bomb went off.  A rescue  worker found him, took his pulse and found none, and left him for dead.  But later, he was  told, another rescuer heard him moaning and carried him out.  His right hand was  smashed and his right ear was left hanging by cartilage, among other injuries.            _  Bragg, Richard, ""In Oklahoma City, Recovery a House at a Time,""   The New York Times,   Sunday, June 8, 1997     E.      Rescue             The period of rescue should be thought of initially in terms of meeting  victims' emergency survival needs and then securing their mental and emotional senses  of safety.  It may last for a few minutes or days while rescuers work to assist  victims find physical, financial, and emotional safety.    1.       Emergency physical response            First responders must focus on emergency physical concerns.  Physical  safety and survival must be assured as much as possible as soon as possible.   However, other life, or connections to life, must be sustained as well.  Safety and survival  of farm animals, pets, or plants may be of great concern.  Many survivors seek  to save historical or sentimental property _ relevant to both individuals and  community.              Ron and Debbie Umbdenstock believe that they have sacrificed their  100-year-old farmhouse and the last of their chickens for the greater good of their village…            The couple's property lies in the path of a slow-moving, man-made flood that  was unleashed…            If the strategy works, the flood gushing south from a levee break upriver…would  be diverted through the broken section and directed back into the Mississippi…            The diversion takes pressure off a main levee along Prairie du Rochur creek  and, everyone hopes, it protects the 250-year-old town of quaint inns and French  restaurants from the worst of the rushing waters.             _ Pressley, Sue Ann, ""Town in Harm's Way Tries to Detour a Juggernaut,""   The Washington Post , Wednesday, August 4, 1993.  Written during the ""Great Flood of 1993.    2.      Emergency emotional and psychological response            At the time of immediate danger and immediately afterwards, emergency  emotional or psychological aid is also needed.  Good crisis intervention is  predicated on immediacy.  Outreach addressing the emotional trauma of disasters should  be performed as soon as possible.  Sometimes this means that crisis responders  are also exposed to danger, and crisis response teams must plan for and confront  issues of safety and security for team members.            Ongoing interventions may be necessary if the duration of the disaster  is for an extended period.   The length of actual impact affects the timeline of access  and the method of access. The timeline of access for emotional  ""rescuers""/responders may be depicted in the following two ways communities tend to respond:  a.     Sudden, Immediate, Short-Term, Low-Point Disasters    •     Impact: up to 48 hours later  _      Focus on survival issues  _      Reactions are blunted through numbing  _      Elation at surviving is complicated by grief, denial of the disaster, and  sudden awareness of vulnerability.            At this stage in the timeline of access, ideally, intervention should occur  as soon as possible.  Even if the trauma continues for days or weeks, initial  intervention should be immediate.  Early visibility of responders and  interventions focused on practical needs facilitate later interventions addressing  the psychological aftermath of the trauma event.  •     Immediate aftermath: 7-14 days  _      Focus is on psychological numbing with emotional flooding.  _      The disaster becomes integrated in present life as routine.  _      Denial and defenses against the impact of the disaster are erected.  _      Depression and fatigue set in.            Access at this point may be denied if no contact was made in the  impact stage of the crisis.  Communities sense their ability to react to the crisis  and contain it.  They feel like they have done ""a good job.""  In many cases,  they have, yet the job often has been done at the expense of their own  emotional and psychological well-being.  Crisis responders are best used to  support community decision-making and to provide assistance in generating  community involvement and contact for individuals who feel isolated.  They are  also useful in helping communities and individuals begin to plan what will  happen next in their response to the aftermath of trauma.  •     Circle of control/exhaustion: 14 days to 6 months  _      Focus is on returning to routine and reestablishing community bonds.  _      Stress levels may be high due to fatigue and increasing secondary  traumas.  _      Community members may reject any assistance because it serves to  remind them of the original trauma.            After trauma has enveloped a community for two weeks or more,  the community and many individuals become exhausted and simply cannot  deal with any continuing stimuli.  Ideally, ongoing intervention begins and  continues with group and individual crisis counseling.  It is always useful to have  responders available during the first six months after an event to help  survivors cope with exhaustion and the sudden influx of emotion.  •     Access through education: 6 months onward  _ Focus is on education and learning about what happened and how  the event will affect the long-term health and relationships of the community.  _ Communities begin to prepare for the future, including learning how to  prevent or mitigate the impact of future tragedies.            After the exhaustive activities of responding to the catastrophe,  individuals and communities often begin to reassess their need for intervention.  If  they have rejected help in the past, it may be more acceptable to receive  information and education as a part of a training program for future events.   Such programs provide a safe place for individuals to learn about their reactions  as well as allowing communities and individuals prepare and train for other  uncommon events.  This training and preparation can be a primary  defense against future trauma when horrifying events may occur.  b.      Sudden Immediate Long Term Low Point Disasters   •      Emergency Phase: first 3 to 4 weeks after event  _     Vulnerable and open about anxieties  _     High level of social contact  _     Willing to talk with anyone and tell individual stories  •      Resistance Phase: 4 to 6 weeks  _     Frustration with reciprocal caregiving among support systems  _     Individuals want to talk about event but don't want to hear about it  _     Modification of routines and creation of new behaviors  _     Exhaustion with new demands  _     Return to inventory and self-assessment  •      Conspiracy of Silence Phase: 6 to 8 weeks  _     Inhibitions on confronting consequences of the event  _     Focus on normality  _     Social conflict rises  _     Victims' physical health suffers  _     Stigmatization of long term psychological needs            The problems of social conflict can be particularly intense and  increase community vulnerability to rises in assaults, domestic violence, child  abuse, and even workplace violence.            A counselor's comment after Hurricane Hugo hit Florida in 1989  underscores this problem.                As long as people were dealing with survival needs _ food, clothes, shelter _  they didn't have a chance to focus on their emotions.… Now the emotions are surfacing.   The level of frustration is very high.  People are just worn out.               _ Joyner as quoted by Leland,   The Virginian-Pilot , March 21, 1990.      •      Adaptation Phase: 8 to 12 weeks  _     Coping strategies employed effectively  _     Consolidation of resources  _     Focus on meeting future challenges  _     Consensus building for community alliances  •      Repetition Phase: 12 to 24 weeks  _     In long-term disasters, communities may repeat the process of  moving through their anxieties at each new major community milestone of  reconstruction.  For instance, after a major flooding, the process may  proceed from the point of the flood's impact until there is stabilization in the  initial relocation process.  The process may begin again when community  members return to their homes after the waters recede, and restart when  they begin to rebuild.  _     Education and interventions should be available during each repetition.  F.      Remedy/mitigation             The remedy or mitigation phase following a disaster is the period when a  community or an individual attempts to regain control of life and face the short-  and long-range consequences of the tragedy.  It overlaps with rescue efforts when  rescue has been extended over a period of time.  The dangers in this phase come  from those who cause ""second injuries.""  1.      Disaster euphoria _ the honeymoon period            Initially, there may be a euphoric reaction among the survivors,  accompanied by many congratulations on heroic efforts in the face of the catastrophe.   The community seems to pull together and the very survival of many may be  viewed as an opportunity for change and elation.  On June 14, 1990, the Wegee  Creek/Pipe Creek flood in Southeastern Ohio left 24 people dead and 60 homes  demolished.  Two months later, one of the survivors remarked:                We lost everything we owned, but we have our lives, and it's time for a  new beginning.             _ Michelmore, P., ""The Night the Creeks Ran Wild,""    Reader's Digest , January, 1991.      2.      Disillusionment             Despite initial feelings of the joy of survival, communities and individuals  are often plunged into disillusionment days or months after the event.  This  disillusionment may parallel individual feelings of survivor guilt or lasting stress  reactions.  However, some of the sources of disillusionment center around efforts  to rebuild a life, to seek justice, or simply to function as a community whose  primary bonds, now, are painful.  Some of the sources of disillusionment  arise from the construction of memorials, civil litigation, the response of the  criminal justice system, media response, public policy responses, or social inequalities.      •     Memorials as a divisive force                Almost a year after a tornado blew in the wall of an elementary school here,  killing nine youngsters and injuring 17 as they ate in the cafeteria, parents are divided  by an emotional dispute over how best to remember those who died.… The  bereaved parents who helped design the stone _ a slab of black granite etched with the  victims' names and an illustration of a boy and girl ascending a light-filled staircase _  say it is a joyful monument to their children.  But many parents whose children  survived say the memorial resembles a tomb         stone and would be a grim daily reminder of a day they desperately want their  children to forget.             _ Foderaro, L.W., ""Where Schoolchildren Died, Dissension Over a Memorial,""    The New York Times , November 2, 1990.  •     Civil litigation                   Four lawyers and a law-firm runner face misdemeanor barratry   [unethical ""ambulance-chasing""]  charges for allegedly soliciting clients after last September's school bus  accident in Alton, Texas.  Twenty-one children died and 60 were injured when the bus plunged  into a water-filled gravel pit.             _ Marcotte, P., ""Barratry Indictments,""    American Bar Association Magazine , 1989.    •     Criminal justice system            Despite federal legislation providing victims with the right to be present at  a trial and to testify through a victim impact statement at the sentencing  stage, Judge Richard Matsch, who presided over the   McVeigh  Oklahoma City bombing case, ruled in 1996 that victims who were present during the  trial would not be allowed to testify at any sentencing.  Succeeding legislation  has sought to clarify the victims' rights, but because the judge entertained  doubts about the constitutionality of the new law, the 40 victims selected as  potential ""impact witnesses"" were advised that if they attend the trial, they might be  later barred from testifying.  Though  the court eventually allowed victims who  observe the trial to testify at sentencing, the ruling only affected a handful of  the impact witnesses _ all the others, fearing a contrary ruling,  had stayed away.            After Betsy Parks was murdered on the North Carolina State  University campus in Raleigh, her parents, Ross and Betty Parks, waited seven years  for a murder trial.  Betty Parks explained:              It was … six and one half years after Betsy died when Gary Coleman was  extradited from a prison in Georgia to North Carolina and charged with her murder.  For the  next fourteen months he was able to delay going to trial with motion after motion _  thirty-one of them at one point.            These continued delays kept us off balance all of one year.  I felt helpless,  frustrated, and angry, wanting the trial behind us, but also wanting the preliminary steps  done correctly.  If Coleman had indeed murdered Betsy, I didn't want him escaping  conviction through a  technicality.               _ Betty Parks, North Carolina (personal communication with the author)    •     Media response              A controversial front-page photograph of a dead pressman sprawled on a  conveyer belt after he was shot by a deranged co-worker has prompted a law suit against   The Courier Journal  of Louisville.

What started at an organizational meeting at a restaurant on Route 17 near  Paramus in February, 1989, split in two.  The call for justice was touched by discord, as  the former leader of the Victims of Flight 103 group became president of the  breakaway Families of Pan Am 103/Lockerbie and is now voicing opposition to the bill  [Proposed Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990], which the original family group  still supports.             _ ""Lockerbie Aftermath: Split Among Families,""    The New York Times , August 12, 1990.    •     Social inequalities              [In the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, Mr. Parrish, a community organizer  said] the donated food and clothing, which keep people going until the Federal  grants arrive, add a disquieting effect in isolated and insular rural areas, allowing  many poor people to see just how poor they are.

""Neighbors, planners, government officials: don't get in my way while I'm  getting what's mine.""            Much of what has happened since 1991 bears witness          to the triumph of selfishness: immense and ugly structures designed without a care  for context or consanguinity, neighbors who coexist amid smoldering resentments. …             _ Kirp, D.L., ""There goes the neighborhood: after the Berkeley fire, an  architectural disaster,""  Harper's  Magazine , March, 1997.      3.       ""Remedy concerns"" for the crisis responder  •     Practical concerns include establishing rumor-control mechanisms,  facilitating reliable, effective communication about disaster issues, mitigating media  intrusions, assisting with funeral and memorial concerns, and providing  training and education on crisis, trauma and appropriate interventions.  •     Group crisis intervention sessions can be a part of the remedial plan.   Repetitive group crisis intervention and retrospective or reflective group crisis  intervention provide useful tools for this remedial process.  •     Community organization activities can be a source of social  reconstruction that is critical for many survivors.  The crisis responder should be  prepared to provide guidance to help survivors initiate such activities in a  constructive way.  •     Planning and participating in long term trauma interventions.  A  devastating community disaster affects community members for years.  Sometimes  additional outside interventions are useful for months as well as on the first  ""anniversary"" of the tragedy or when criminal justice processes continue for years.    G.      Adjustment             The final phase in response to disaster is the period of adjustment.  This  phase can extend over generations.    1.      Stage One            The  first  stage of adjustment involves living through the first year after  the event.  During that time, survivors must get used to doing things they did  before the disaster.  Differences in physical environment and emotional or  psychological responses will color everything they do.  2.      Stage Two            The  second  stage of adjustment involves the time period from the end of  the first year through the next ten or fifteen years _ until the beginning of the  next generation of community memories.  For many survivors, this will be a period  of ""reliving"" and retelling the event over and over again.  The transition from  this period to the next will be marked when survivors realize that young people  do not remember the disaster.  It represents the aging of the first generation of  victims and survivors.  3.      Stage Three             The  third  stage of adjustment is the time during which the catastrophe is  remembered directly by fewer and fewer living survivors but the impact is  evident on the next generation: there is often a yearning among both the survivors  and their descendents to preserve the memories of the trauma.  4.      Stage Four            The  fourth  stage is a time when the initial catastrophe has been converted  into history and legend by succeeding generations.  Sometimes the stories of the  disaster are changed, transformed or utilized to emphasize certain values and  behaviors.   At the third and fourth stages of adjustment, there may be  cross-generational transfer of the traumatic experience.  These stages begin with the  children of the original victims and survivors and thus overlap with Stage Two but  it often becomes apparent as these children reach adulthood and continue  the story of the disaster through their own children.                The individual survivor's war history is crucial to the understanding of  survivors' offspring.  They seem to have consciously and unconsciously absorbed their  parents' Holocaust experiences into their lives almost in toto.  Holocaust parents, in the  attempt to give their best, taught their children how to survive and, in the process,  transmitted to them the life conditions under which they had survived the war.            Many children of survivors, like their parents, manifest Holocaust derived  behaviors, particularly on the anniversaries of their parents' traumata.  Moreover,  some have internalized, as parts of their identity, the images of those who perished  and hence, simultaneously live in different places (Europe and America) and  different time periods (1940 and the present).             _ Danieli, Y., ""The Treatment and Prevention of Long-term Effects  and Intergenerational Transmission of Victimization:  A Lesson from Holocaust  Survivors and Their Children,""   Trauma and Its  Wake , Figley, C., ed., Brunner/Mazel, NY, 1985.              …There's unfinished business in the second generation, for only when  you acknowledge the past can you be free.  Our task is to deal with it and not forget it.   Even though it is painful, we can't _ we mustn't _ avoid this work.               _ Werner Bohleber, in ""The Pathways of Pain,""  Fellman, B.,   Yale Alumni Magazine , March 1995.    III. Spatial Dimensions of the Crisis Experience    A.      Convergence        The concept of convergence refers to the phenomenon of the gathering of people,  information, and attention around a disaster site.  People who converge usually  represent groups such as ""returnees,"" those who were at the disaster but left and come back,  ""absentees,"" those who weren't there at the time but, in their minds, could've or  should've been there, people in the general area of the disaster who are anxious and frightened  by the event, the curious, exploiters, voyeurs, and the helpers.       Convergence can be  positive  or   negative .  1.       Positive convergence            Positive convergence occurs when people go to the scene with  appropriate training and at the invitation of the community that has suffered the event.   Some examples are firefighters, law enforcement officers, paramedics,  disaster relief groups, and crisis responders.  However, it should be noted that  even when individuals or groups are well-trained, they may not be wanted or  needed and can thus have a negative effect at the scene.              In the response to the PSA crash in San Diego in 1978, 60 ambulances  arrived when only 6 were needed.             _ ""Psychological Counseling is Necessary to Help Employees Cope with  Plane Crashes,""  O'Connell, R.,  Crime Control  Digest , February 15, 1988.    2.      Negative convergence            Negative convergence occurs when people assemble for their own  purposes.  They may be looters, voyeurs, ambulance-chasing attorneys,  mental health professionals, media and others.             Even before the debris and human remains had been cleared from the Detroit  site of the USA's second-worst air crash, lawyers and insurance adjusters were  descending on the victims' grieving families.            Like circling vultures, lawyers swooped in to sign up clients.  And the  airline's insurers scrambled to head them off by offering settlements to the families of the  156 victims of Northwest Airlines Flight #255.  Their ordeal is just beginning.  They are  the targets of a big-bucks tug of war between personal injury lawyers and               the airline and its insurer.  The bidding began within days of the crash.             _ ""When Tragedy Hits, Families Need Time,""    USA Today , August 26, 1987.                A man who identified himself as a Roman Catholic priest and counseled  relatives of victims of the Northwest Airlines crash here last month may actually have been  an imposter soliciting cases for a lawyer, officials say.             _ ""Priest Suspected as Imposter,""    New York Times , September 14, 1987.      B.      Media convergence        Media convergence can have both positive and negative effects.  Sensationalized  coverage of traumatized or grieving survivors may add to their pain.  A photo carried in both   The Washington Post , December 23, 1988, and   News-week  accompanied the coverage of the Pan Am Flight 103 tragedy and carried the caption,   ""The body of a passenger still strapped to a seat is lowered by a rescue worker from a rooftop in Lockerbie,  Scotland.""   The photo brought a wave of outrage from readers.       On the other hand, the media can be the most effective purveyor of useful information  to communities on the impact of trauma.   The Gainesville Sun   included an eight-page supplement on the emotional aftermath of the serial murders of five college students at the  University of Florida and the Santa Fe Community College in August, 1990.    C.      Proximity        The closer one is to the center of the disaster, the more likely one is to be at risk  for post-disaster crisis and long-term stress reactions.  Individuals are increasingly subject  to the intensity of sensorial information when they are directly involved in the disaster area.   The center of the disaster is defined as the point of impact.  Eye witnesses and survivors  of loved ones who died in the disaster are at high risk, in addition to victims who have  suffered major injury or certain types of property damage.  The concentric circles shown in the  figure on the next page describe these risk factors.                I couldn't sleep.  I couldn't eat.  I lost twenty pounds in four weeks after seeing  the wreck.  It was so close to my house and the shock of being alive and whole  seemed amazing.  But at the same time I was desolate.  My heart hurt for the people who  died and those who were injured.             _     Survivor of Amtrak-Conrail train crash, NOVA Crisis Response Reports, 1987    D.      Remoteness        There is a human compulsion to want to be at the site of a disaster if one's loved  ones or property are directly affected.  The more remote the disaster from immediate access  by rescuers, survivors of loved ones who are injured or dead, owners of homes destroyed,  or other concerned community members, the more intense stress is experienced.  If it is  impossible to get to the site physically, the measure of remoteness may be affected by  the availability of telephone or electronic access.                For two weeks following the storm, no outside organization _ not the American  Red Cross, the Salvation Army or even the media _ realized that this isolated  community had been virtually destroyed.  ""Most of the residents left Copahee just before  the hurricane hit, and when they returned, they were too stunned to do anything.  The  town looked like a war zone.  Houses were reduced to splinters.  Trailers were destroyed.   People were sifting through the rubble, trying to find any personal belonging _  a family picture, a child's toy.  It was a shocking, horrible sight.""             _ Claverie, L.,  ""Hurricane!""    Family Circle , September 25, 1990.       E.      Geographic spread        The greater the area affected by the disaster, the more chance that it will become  a community-wide tragedy.  People identify with certain geographical areas as well as  geographical symbols.  If those are affected, they extend the range of community  members who feel touched by the catastrophe.                Other storms piled up more snow, recorded higher winds, killed more people.   But for combined extent and intensity, the Blizzard of '93, as it was called in most of  the U.S., was in a class by itself.  Tornadoes in Florida, record cold in Alabama (2  degrees F. in Birmingham), mountainous snows from North Carolina (50 in. at  Mount Mitchell) to New York (43 in. at Syracuse), hurricane-force winds (110 m.p.h.  in Franklin County, Florida) _ all were part of the same monster storm system that  from March 12 to March 15 spread death and destruction from Cuba, where three  died, to the Canadian Maritimes (four killed).  Deaths totaled 238, and that did not  include 48 sailors missing from vessels that sank off Nova Scotia and in the Gulf of Mexico.   Worst tolls: 50 in Pennsylvania, and 44 in Florida, where winds made  deadly projectiles out of rubble still lying on the ground from Hurricane Andrew in August.   Helicopters and search parties on snowshoes were still looking for hikers and  campers stranded in Southern U.S. Mountains; nine were airlifted out of Tennessee's  Great Smoky Mountains National Park as late as Thursday.  Economic damages  seemed sure to climb well past an early guess of $800 million; in New York State,  Governor Mario Cuomo estimated snow-removal costs alone at $120 million.  If it was not  ""the storm of the century,"" survivors hope they never see the real one.            _ The Washington Post   ~~ [date]    IV. Role Dimensions    A.       How does one identify or define a victim?   1.      A role classification system            One suggestion comes from  Disasters and Disaster  Stress,  AMS Press, New York, 1989, in a classification scheme developed by A.J.W. Taylor and  A.G. Frazier.  It follows:  a.       Primary Victims  _ those who are directly exposed to a large scale  catastrophe with the potential for destroying life, disrupting well established  relationships and patterns of behavior, and for destroying property;  b.       Secondary Victims  _ those with close family and personal ties to the  primary victims who themselves have severe grief and, perhaps, guilt reactions;  c.       Tertiary Victims  _ those whose occupations and duties require them to  respond to any major alert in the community and to assist with any subsequent  rehabilitation and restoration work;  d.       Quarternary Victims  _ those concerned and caring members of  communities beyond the impact area who express their intentions,  often with inappropriate goods and services.  They might also come from organizations that feel  some responsibility for having perhaps contributed to the cause of a particular  disaster;  e.       Quinternary Victims  _ those individuals and groups who lose control when  in proximity to disasters and either reveal their underlying psychopathology  by their ghoulish preoccupation with cadavers or by their unruly behavior in mobs;  f.       Sesternary Victims  _ miscellaneous people who  (i)      think that, but for chance events, they would have been primary or  secondary victims;    (ii)      refrained from expressing a premonition to somebody who  subsequently became a primary victim;  (iii) actively induced people to enter situations in which they became  primary victims;  (iv) were the close relatives and friends of the tertiary victims who waited  at home for news that their people were safe and then shared the  emotional burden of the post-disaster working situation;  (v)      as clinicians and researchers, at a stage often far removed from the  disaster-face, are liable to have their professional competence affected because of  1.      the acute and prolonged demands presented by their own  post-disaster work,  2.      the risk of emotional identification with the suffering of some workers,  3.      any compelling desire to appear to be doing something  immediately ""useful"" as distinct from the indirect or abstract,  4.      any thirst from seeking sustained dramatic experience;  (vi) suffer guilt from benefiting from a disaster.  2.      An individual's subjective perception of role            While the definitions above are based on observation, an individual's  subjective experience may record the tragedy from several different perspectives.  That  subjective experience may involve complex roles:  •     The victim who is injured or who has lost property in the event.  •     The sensorial witness, either as a bystander or a responder.  •     The survivor of a loved one involved in the catastrophe _ a loved one  who has died, been injured, or had property destroyed.  •     The rescuer who has helped others, sometimes as an on-scene responder  or as a remote responder who has a job supporting on-scene responders.  •     A community member who has witnessed or survived a disaster which  has threatened the community's existence.  3.      Often rescuers have cognitively dissonant reactions to their roles.  •     Some were perceived by others as heroes when they were not.              Joshua Conyers, age 14, died in the Carrolltown bus crash.  He was attributed  with saving his younger brother Aaron, but other evidence suggests that those initial  stories were untrue.             _ Crisis Response Report, NOVA, June, 1988.    •     Some are perceived as heroes, yet they, themselves feel they failed.              Robert Booker  [later celebrated as a hero]   will never forget his descent into the smoky darkness of a crumpled Amtrak car where passengers lay injured and dying.  He  was the first one into the car _ the first to try to douse flames and save a man whose  legs and head he could partially see sticking through the choking smoke and wreckage.   ""There was a guy stuck.  He was yelling, `Help me,' … The man's legs and hair  were in flames and he was coughing with smoke.  I took off my shirt and put it over his face.   He died right there. … I won't forget the fact that I couldn't get that one man out.   His face will stay with me forever.""             _  The Baltimore Sun , January 6, 1987.     •     Other people, while successful in helping during the event, feel  uncomfortable with being given ""hero"" status.              Ever since Capt. Al Haynes returned to flying DC-10s in October, strangers  have been stopping him in airports to shake his hand.  Passengers on his flights send  notes to the cockpit saying they're happy he's the pilot.  Haynes … has never been  comfortable in the hero role … but he'll be in Sioux City for the reunion.""               _ Sharon, L. ""Healing Process Continues at Crash Reunion,""   USA Today , July, 1990.    B.      List of population attributes             In Appendix A to this chapter is a list of some attributes of certain populations in  disaster.  It is not meant to be exhaustive but simply to serve as a stimulus to crisis  responders to think of special concerns of population groups.    V. Assessment of Social Disruption        A final consideration in examining the dimensions of a trauma event is the assessment  of social disruption.  The experience of trauma is rooted in the sensorial impacts, the  perception of threat, the emotional and physical reactions to that threat, and the attempt  to cognitively understand what is happening.  It is also rooted in the trauma victim's  formation of the disaster's chronology and the need to put the traumatic events into an organized  narrative.  But merely understanding the story of what happened leaves it unresolved.  A  final step to integrating the plot of this particular story with the narrative of one's life is to find  a way to interpret its meaning and value in one's belief system.  That system is tied to  cultural and social values and to community relationships.  The extent of social  disruption may help indicate how difficult or dissonant the integration process will be.  The  following are some considerations for understanding the social disruption after a community  wide catastrophe.    A.     Practical indicators   1.      Disruption of transportation and communication systems that interrupt the  ability to reestablish social contacts.    2.      Disruption of the community economic system.  This includes lost and  interrupted jobs; destruction of the economic base of a community such as  agriculture, tourism, or a major corporate structure; or lost tax revenues.  3.      Alterations in spatial arrangements of neighborhoods and businesses that  disrupt behavioral routines and mobility.    B.     Emotional indicators   1.      Reduction in community wide participation at social and religious routines  and events.  2.       The loss through death or injury of key community or family leaders in  addition to other community members.  3.      The exacerbation of cultural tensions.  4.      The incapacitation of the caregiving community.  5.       The destruction of community symbols or rituals.  6.      The lack of community history and traditions on which to rely in the face of  disaster.  7.      Intermittent and inconsistent assistance provided by external formal aid  structures.  8.      Preexisting cultural and social values that demean or isolate victims or  survivors who openly manifest trauma symptoms or acknowledge the disaster as  traumatizing.      VI. Possible Disaster Impacts    A.      A classification system        [See ""Disaster Typology"" in Appendix B, which is adapted from a table prepared by  A.J.W. Taylor in  Disasters and Disaster  Stress, AMS Press, New York, 1989, p. 12]       Causes of disaster are defined as  ""natural,""   relating to disasters that have been caused by profound disruptions of the physical environment,   ""industrial,""  relating to  disasters arising from a serious disruption of the ecosystem from the products, by-products,  and waste from the manufacturing system, and  ""human,""   relating to disasters arising from errors of judgment, deliberate action, or incompetence.  B.      Prominent issues relating to different causes of disaster   1.      Natural disasters  a.      Often cause heavy casualties and severe damage to property.  b.     Mythological explanations, omens, and symbols often are used to understand  what happened.  c.      Catastrophes may raise issues of faith or sin.  d.      Survivors often have a greater acceptance of the consequences of ""Acts  of God"" or ""Mother Nature"" than they do of consequences of human-caused  disasters.  e.      Many natural disasters have a clearer period of warning prior to impact.  f.     Since personal blame is not a primary issue, there may be a greater  outpouring of altruism and compassion in efforts to help survivors.                 Looking back in history, a description of an earthquake and its  consequent explanations is useful.  On November 1, 1755 a major earthquake occurred in  Portugal that killed over 60,000 people.  Following the earthquake were tidal waves and fires.   The event was interpreted as a demonstration of God's anger at an evil population  and many writings on the philosophies of God's revenge and the duty of making peace  with God were explored.             _ Kendrick, T.D.  The Lisbon  Earthquake . New York, NY.  Lippincott, 1955,      2.      Industrial or technological disasters  a.      Political issues may have affected the installation or operation of a plant or  industrial site and may be seen as the cause of the tragedy.  b.      Economic issues related to the reasons for the operation of the installation  or the potential for community revival may compound the explanations.    c.      There is a lack of personal accountability for the event and institutional  depersonalization of the victims.  d.      ""Loss of faith in experts"" may increase stress levels as well as resentments  and dissensions in communities.  e.      In many technological disasters, the fear of illness, cancer, or other  diseases may increase even when there is no evidence of probable correlation with  the event.  f.     First responders and crisis responders may be reluctant to provide  services because of their personal fear of contamination.  g.     Many such catastrophes have long-term impact and no perceivable low point.                In technological disasters...the duration of the initial crisis period may be  prolonged.  For example, the accident at TMI[Three Mile Island] unfolded over  several days, not several hours.  Furthermore, the original leakage triggered a series  of concomitant events, including the disruptions caused by evacuation, fears  associated with the hydrogen bubble, continued uncertainty about how and when the  decontamination process would be carried out, subsequent revelations that the accident  came within 30 to 60 minutes of a meltdown, the venting of krypton gas the following  spring, and the uncertainty of whether the undamaged reactor would be started up again.   Thus, crisis intervention models usually employed in acute crisis situations may not  be entirely appropriate.             _ Bromet, Evelyn, J., ""The Nature and Effects of Technological Failures,""    Psychosocial Aspects of Disaster , eds. Gist, Richard & Lubin, Bernard, New York: Wiley &  Sons, 1989      3.      Human disasters  a.      Issues of justice/fairness are critical when human beings cause disasters.  In  the United States either or both the civil and criminal justice systems may  become involved in investigations and court processes.  b.      Most tragedies caused by humans are seen as preventable, yet in a social  context, little has been done to concentrate on prevention strategies rather than  intervention strategies after tragedy occurs.  c.      If the disaster is caused by purposeful human cruelty, there may be issues  related to evil or the impossibility of understanding the criminal mind.  d.     If the disaster is related to social conflict such as riots or wars, there may  be demonization of different cultural groups in a society.  e.      When humans cause accidents, there are often issues related to the   preventability of the disaster.  Accidents often cause more intense anger in  survivors than do crime-related crises.  f.     Human caused disasters may significantly affect the abilities of individuals  to trust each other and thus exaccerbate the deterioration of social bonds.  This is  particularly true when violence is committed by family members or friends.                 The damage to the survivor's faith and sense of community is particularly  severe when the traumatic events themselves involve the betrayal of important relationships.   The imagery of these events often crystallizes around a moment of betrayal, and it is  this breach of trust which gives the intrusive images their intense emotional power.               _ Herman, J.,  Trauma and Recovery       C.      Prominent issues illustrating different elements of disaster   1.     Earth  a.      The earth is assumed to be firm and safe.  In some cultures, the earth is  the source of life.  Earth disasters threaten the myth of ""terra firma"".  b.      Earth disasters often involve events that imprison or enclose victims  against their will.  c.      Most earth disasters are sudden and often happen without warning even in  geographical areas that may expect a disaster.  2.     Air  a.      The air is perceived as erratic and less under the control of human beings.   Since God or nature seems to have control, resulting disasters may be  more readily integrated into individual and community understandings.  b.      Due to the unpredictability of the wind, the air and space, the randomness  of community or individual impact often heightens terror during impact and  confusion at inventory.  c.      Explanations of wind events may take the form of trying to understand  the ""winds of change"".  3.     Fire  a.      Fire is both terrifying and exciting to most people.  Fire was a ""gift from  the gods"" that allowed humans to expand their understanding of the world in  old mythologies.  There is still a sense of excitment over fires —  even disasterous ones.  This creates a cognitive dissonance for many after a  major disaster.  b.       Fire evokes concepts of hell and damnation for some cultures.  It is  particularly true among many cultures in the United States.  Hence, death by  fire poses many conceptual problems for those who confront it.  c.       On a practical level, fire often consumes or distorts the bodies of  people who are its victims and surviving family and friends may have difficultly  dealing with these consequences,  4.     Water  a.      Disasters caused by water are varied.  The consequences are also varied.   A flood may destroy miles of property, homes and lives.  The drowning of  an individual or a community when a ship sinks also involves the element of  water.  In either case, the catastrophe changes the landscape or seascape of life.   In the Judeo-Christian traditions, water disasters are often equated with  the great flood depicted in the Bible.  b.      Natural floods may be equated with natural forces such as those that  are found in wind disasters.  Floods caused by manmade structures may  be more difficult to deal with by survivors.  Accidents on the waters are  often viewed with horror due to a pervasive thinking that water is inherently unsafe.  c.      On a practical level, water, like fire, may destroy or distort the bodies  of those who die.  5.     People  a.      People victimized by other people are often the most angry.  There is a  difference between the anger manifested against a person who is perceived  as mentally ill and a person who is simply negligent.  The anger is usually  greater toward to the latter.  This accountability that individuals and communities  impose upon other individuals or communities is especially agonizing since  it often contributes to further social distress.  b.      The particular dynamic that disasters based on human elements may  include is the tension caused by cruelty and brutality executed by an offender.   The idea that an individual or consortium of individuals is unfeeling or  unrepentant for the damage that they caused is reprehensible to most.  c.      When victims are subjected to specific acts of torture, mutilation, hate  or degradation, the outrage of other individuals and communities in  response may be especially high.         D.      Differences between types of disaster threats based on conceptual,  sensorial, and duration issues.                  The following is a list of different kinds of disasters and the issues they raise.   These are not exhaustive but may help crisis responders to identify critical  experiences and concerns of survivors in the aftermath of each disaster type.  Similar experiences  and concerns arise in many different disaster types, yet some are disaster-specific.  For  instance, in water disasters such as floods, death caused by drowning results in  bloated bodies, while in fire disasters, dead bodies may be charred beyond recognition.  1.      Earth disasters: avalanches, volcanos, landslides, and earthquakes  a.      Useful recent examples.  •      Mt. St. Helens volcano, 1980 - 68 persons dead  •     The Armenian earthquake, 1988  •     Loma Prieta earthquake, 1989 - 55 dead  •     Banff, Alberta, Canada avalanche, March 5, 1991 - 10 dead  •     Northridge earthquake, 1994 - 24 persons dead  •     Great Hanshin earthquake (Kobe, Japan) 1995 - over 5,000 dead  b.      The impact when the earth moves  •     Volcano            The eruption of Mt. Pelee on Martinque in 1902 wiped out a city  of 30,000 in a matter of minutes.              The destructive effect of the avalanche of white-hot particles mixed with gas  and superheated steam traveling at hurricane speed was such that most people  died instantly wherever they happened to be, for the temperature was estimated to  have been 1000 degrees Centigrade.  Only two men of the town of 30,000 survived:   a shoemaker who survived by some accident, and a prisoner due to be hanged  for murder who was protected by the bizarre condemned cell in which he was kept.   Rescued after three days, he described his experience: ""I smelled nothing but my  own body burning. … Soon I heard nothing but my own unanswered cries for help.""                _ Raphael, B.,  When Disaster Strikes: How Individuals and Communities Cope  with Catastrophe . New York, NY. Basic Books, 1986.    •      Earthquake              ""It all happened in an instant,"" she said.  ""A noise, a terrible swaying, and  then there was no one."" … the Armenian earthquake _ which struck December 7,  killing at least 55,000 people and ruining much larger cities _ was unforgiving  and surgically quick in Spitak.  Everyone in Spitak describes the same feeling,  a tremendous shock ""like a bomb,"" the eerie feel of rocking, and then collapse.             _Remock, D.  ""In Spitak, `We have No More Tears Left',""   The Washington Post , December 15, 1988.              Decades of assumptions were shattered by those 20 seconds of the Great  Hanshin Earthquake.  The people of postwar Japan had put their trust in an  elaborate ""earthquake-proofing"" plan that they were convinced would avert disaster.            … Indeed, Japanese building codes are among the strictest in the world.   A national network of 200 seismic monitors measures and pinpoints every quake  of noticeable magnitude and, among other emergency responses, sends out  computerized instructions to shut down the bullet trains and keep them from derailing at  speeds up to 170 m.p.h.  Everyone takes part in drills at home and at work.  Even the  smallest child in nursery school knows what to do when the shaking starts: put on your  helmet and crawl under the desk.             Twenty seconds was all it took to leave that faith in tatters and undermine all  the certainties and resolve that stemmed from it.             _Elliott, L. ""Earthquake at  Dawn,"" Readers Digest , November, 1995.    •     Avalanche              It was a silent day.  I was looking out on the snow and the mountain.  It is hard  to explain.  I heard a strange rumble and then a roar.  I didn't know what was happening.   It was unlike anything I had experienced.  And then I saw this incredible wall of  ice and snow crash down the mountain.  I screamed and screamed to no one and  then prayed.               _ NOVA Crisis Response Reports, 1989    c.      Sensorial issues   •     Touch: internal breathing difficulties; experiences of the earth's  movement; cold or heat  •     Smell: toxic fumes and smoke  •     Taste: smoke, iron, heat or cold  •     Sounds: ominous noises, including rumblings and explosions  •     Sights: the destruction of ""indestructible"" buildings, earth forms, dams  or other structures takes place in minutes  d.      Conceptual issues   •     Fear of being buried alive  •     Disruption of the myth of ""terra firma""  •     Fear of suffocation  •     Fear of being pinned down _ claustrophobia.     •     Fear of not being rescued.  e.       Duration issues  •     Earth movements cause relatively quick initial damage  •     Most earth movements are not complete in one event; there is lingering  or continuing impact through aftershocks, sporadic small eruptions, and  the like, which keep the disaster ""alive"" even after the low point  •     Sensorial involvement may be lingering due to long-term visual damage  •     Survival issues may be prolonged and affect rescue and remedy efforts  •     When there are multiple deaths and injuries, funerals or burials may  take weeks or months to complete.  2.      Earth: train and car crashes  a.      Useful case examples  •     Amtrak/Conrail train crash, Baltimore County, MD, 1987 - 16 killed  •     Truck/school bus crash, Carrolltown/Radcliff, KY, 1988 - 27 killed  •     Pickup/car crash, Nageeze, NM, 1994 - 6 killed  •     Commuter train crash, Silver Spring, MD, 1996 - 11 killed  b.      The impact of crashes              I wake up at night in a panic _ shaking, sweating, screaming, as I did then.   The truck's coming towards me _ I'm helpless _ There is nothing I can do _ It's like  some dreadful monster.  And then there's a crash and nothing and this dreadful silence.   Then there's Emily and John and Mary and blood everywhere and their faces smashed _  and they're all dead. … And all I want to be is dead too.  I'm tortured by my dreams  and by the memories of what happened.  I can't get them out of my mind.  I try  everything I can, but the shriek of brakes, the grinding noise of a truck, even the smell of  petrol _ It all comes back again.             _ Raphael, B.,  When Disaster  Strikes , 1986.      c.      Sensorial issues  •     Touch: coldness and heat senses become more sensitive; crashes  usually result in physical injuries for almost all involved even if they are  relatively minor.  •     Smell: fuels, gas, fire, materials burning, blood  •     Taste: metal, fuels and gas, smoke  •     Sounds: crunch of metal, glass shattering and explosions, screech  of brakes  •     Sights: appearance of massive property twisted, broken and strewn  about like toys, physical injuries  d.      Conceptual issues  •     Recovery of intact bodies unlikely  •     Often many bystanders  •     Usually little warning and passengers are helpless to avert the crashes  •     Dispersion afterwards  •     High anger and blame if substance abuse, other forms of recklessness,   are involved  e.      Duration issues  •     Usually immediate short-term impact  •     Survival issues often determined immediately  •     May involve long-term cleanup and sensorial involvement  •     Often results in involvement with the criminal justice system or civil  litigation  3.      Earth: dam failures  a.      Useful examples  •     The Johnstown dam disaster, 1889  •     The Buffalo Creek dam disaster, 1972  b.      Impact of resulting floods                The dam gave way at 3:10 pm.  The water first slashed a ten foot-wide notch in  the top of the dam.  Then the entire middle section caved in.  The torrent spilled into  the bed of the South Fork and climbed its sides, tearing trees out by the roots, and  creating a cloud of dust and debris that whirled ahead of the flood.  The wave smashed  down the Little Conemaugh valley, churning up everything in its path. At one point,  where the valley narrowed, the water reached a height of 89 feet (measured later by the  flood lines); the consensus among witnesses to its awesome rush was that the wave  was generally 30-40 feet high.  The watchers at the dam stared dumbstruck as the  entire two-mile long lake emptied in 45 minutes.  Roaring frightfully and rolling over  itself, surf-like, the great wave plunged at a speed estimated variously at 20 to 40 miles  an hour, billowing out and then hourglassing in where the valley does. … [one  survivor said] ""It looked like an ocean with waves and surf, but it was the roar I remember  best _ a rolling sound like thunder, but not like anything I've heard since.  I think it took  about an hour and a half for it to pass.""  The whirling wall of  water encountered its  first major obstacle at the recently built stone railroad bridge. … Timbers,  houses, railroad cars, makeshift rafts and machinery crashed to a stop there,  temporarily blocking the path of the flood. … Floating houses and parts of houses, many  loaded with people, smacked one after another into the debris at the bridge. …  Sometime around nightfall the debris at the bridge caught fire.  Hundreds of people  trapped in the wreckage, some with their arms or legs pinned, now faced the hideous  prospect of waiting to burn to death.            Johnstown Flood survivors would never forget the screams from the  blazing wreckage during the night … A railroad man at the bridge said the victims were  ""a lot of flies on flypaper, struggling to get away with no hope and no chance to  save them.""               _ Jackson, D.D., ""When 20 million tons of water flooded Johnstown,""   Smithsonian Magazine , May, 1989.      c.      Sensorial issues  •     Sight of ""mud wave"" and tidal wave effect  •     Appearance of bodies in strange shapes and strange places, e.g.,  hanging from trees  •     Desolation of landscape  •     Smell of sludge and sodden property  •     Sound of roar of waves of water  •     Coldness and wetness  d.     Conceptual issues  •     Suddenness of dam collapse  •     Bloated and distorted bodies  •     Complications of electrocution in aftermath  •     Little heeded warning  •     Industrial blame not individual accountability  •     Political implications where government is involved  •     Economic implications where private industry is involved  e.     Duration issues  •     Initial impact most likely to last 3-5 hours  •     Long days of sensorial involvement  •     Years of reconstruction of property  4.     Air:  Hurricanes, tornadoes, cyclones, blizzards  a.     Useful examples  •     Xenia, Ohio, tornado, 1974  •     Cyclone Tracy, 1974  •     Hurricane Hugo, 1989  •     Joliet/Will County tornado, 1990  •     Hurricane Andrew, 1991  b.      Impact of wind disasters            In Darwin, Australia, Christmas eve and Christmas morning, 1974, were  brutally disrupted by a cyclone.  The very time of occurrence made the whole experience unreal.   The primitive and overwhelming sounds of the wind, the force of the winds and the  rain, and destruction of what had seemed to be solid structures were indeed frightening.   It was estimated that gusts of winds exceeded 250 KM/hour.  ""As the full fury of  Tracy struck, windows broke, houses were deroofed and finally disintegrated as families  were left in the rubble of their own homes in the pitch black, the pelting rain and the  shrieking gale,…  Children were wrenched away from the arms of their parents, the  possessions of a lifetime were blown away.""  There was then, ""after four hours of this  terrifying ordeal, a deadly hush,"" as Darwin stood in the eye of the cyclone.  Then after a       period of eerie calm, the winds returned from the opposite direction with renewed  force, bringing further death and devastation, until the final period of calm several  hours later.  65 people had died, 140 seriously injured, most of the population of 45,000  left homeless.               _ Raphael, B.,  When Disaster  Strikes , 1986.      c.      Conceptual issues  •     Isolation and a sense of abandonment  •     Randomness of destruction  •     Differences between hurricanes/cyclones and tornados  •     Fewer immediate deaths but often deaths in the aftermath due to  electrocutions from wires in the waters, or to heart attacks as people try to  rebuild destroyed property  d.      Sensorial issues  •     Appearance of whirling funnel cloud from dark heavy cloud  •     Appearance of impact of heavy winds: property destruction, trees  tossed around  •     Appearance of yellowish gray just before impact  •     Sound of roar of wind like a train or jet airplane  •     Freezing cold or humidly warm  e.      Duration issues  •     Tornados usually short impact; hurricanes usually longer impact  •     Both have ongoing sensorial involvement  •     Long-term reconstruction period  5.      Air: chemical or nuclear pollution  a.      Useful examples  •     Bhopal, India, toxic dioxin   •     Chernobyl nuclear plant (Soviet Union), 1986 _ Accident released cloud  of radioactive pollution  •     Three Mile Island (PA) accident, 1979  •     Love Canal (NY)  •     Times Beach (MO) - Dioxin dispersed in floods, 25,000 people evacuated  b.      Impact of pollution             On the morning of March 28, 1979, one of two generating units of a nuclear  power plant called Three Mile Island experienced an odd sequence of equipment failures  and human errors, resulting in the escape of several puffs of radioactive steam.  It was  a moment of considerable potential danger, as we all were soon to learn.  It was a  moment of considerable uncertainty as well.            At the height of the uncertainty, Pennsylvania's governor, Richard  Thornburgh, issued a calm and measured advisory suggesting that pregnant women and  preschool children living within five miles of the plant might want to evacuate and that all  other people within ten miles ought to consider taking shelter in their homes.  In effect,  the governor was recommending that 3,500 persons living in the shadow of the  reactor relocate for at least the time being and that everyone else stay put.            Instead, some 200,000 persons were alarmed enough to take to the  public highways, and they fled, on average, a remarkable 100 miles.  For every  person advised to leave home, almost 60 did.             _ Erickson, K.

Sensorial issues  •     Personal impact may be objectively low  •     Invisibility of threat  •     Deception of sensorial warning system  •     ""Imagined"" sensory perceptions  e.      Duration issues  •     Onset of catastrophe is prolonged:  warning and threat period may last  for a number of days  •     No low point readily discernible  •     Discovery of harm may be delayed for years    6.      Air: airplane or spacecraft crashes, explosions  a.      Useful examples  •     The Challenger, 1988  •     Pan Am #103, December 22, 1988  •     TWA #800, July 17, 1996  b.      Impact of crashes and explosions              At 3:15 p.m. one year ago, the chicken-finger snack was being served on  United Flight 232, 37,000 feet above northeast Iowa, when the tail engine exploded.   The plane rocked, banked to the right and began to fall.            Shrapnel from the engine had sliced through the jet's control lines.  Precious  hydraulic fluid drained away in two minutes, leaving the crew with no control over  the plane's steering system.  But by varying the thrust to the jet's two remaining  engines, Capt. Al C. Haynes and his crew were able to keep the plane flying the 70 miles to  the Sioux City's Gateway Airport.            The crash came with the warning ""Brace, brace, brace.""            Joseph Trombello, a Chicago auditor, clutched the seat in front of him as the  other passengers tucked heads into laps, grabbed ankles and held children on the floor.   He watched it all from his upright position:         ""You ever try to get into a brace position in coach?""              Looking across Row 18 to the other side of the plane, over knobs of ducked  heads, Trombello saw the ground rise up as the plane dipped to the right.  He is sure he  saw the wing catch the ground the moment before the jet cartwheeled into a fireball  and split apart.            ""I felt like a shoe in the dryer,"" he recalls.            Then he was upside down, hanging from his seat, his glasses gone, smoke in his  eyes, nose and mouth.  In the dark, he heard moans.  All he could think to do was to  crawl through the smoke and debris toward a hazy patch of light in the cornfield.""               _ Ybarra, M.J., ""The Memories that Burn Still,""    The Washington Post , July 19, 1990.    c.

I started to look for shelter.  The sky was clear where I was, but I  could hear the thunder roll.  Then I remember seeing a flash of light and feeling a searing pain.   I was not directly hit but a tree nearby was and one of its branches caught me in the chest.   I thought I wouldn't live because all I could feel was pain.  But then, my head cleared.   I remembered tasting tin on my tongue. … smelling a seared and nauseous charred  smell, I couldn't identify. … I later discovered it was my own flesh.

Impact of explosions                The flames shoot up to 150 feet high and burn at temperatures near 3,000  degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt steel.  They produce a roar like a jet engine and  can be so brilliant that you have to squint at them up close.            If you're smart about it, which is to say if you're experienced, you carry a  10-foot-tall corrugated tin heat shield, wear flame-retardant cotton long johns  beneath coveralls, keep your pockets empty and leave as little skin exposed as possible.   Otherwise, your face and arms begin to burn about 40 yards from the flame and  the keys in your pocket get so hot that they print little red welts on your thigh.            About 20 yards from the wellhead, where the desert sand is so hot that it  shimmers and turns to glass, the rubber soles of your shoes get gummy and start to melt.            The firefighters who get that close tend to step lively, but even that's not a sure bet.

But at that moment,  he heard a howling sound, like that of a jet engine at close range, and looked back  into the casino.  Every detail of that scene is seared forever in his photographic memory.            A huge fireball was blazing through the room toward him.  There were screams  and crashing glass, and everything the ball of fire hit was completely consumed.  He  saw a friend and casino employee, Santiago Torres, scooping up money, or chips, and  when the ball of fire hit him, the flesh of his face shrank tight against his bones, and then  he burst into flames...            Then just as the room seemed to explode, Aponte shoved himself  backward, shredding his hands on the glass, and fell toward the concrete below.  He landed  on top of another person, easing his fall, but broke an ankle.  Somehow Aponte was  able to drag himself away from the orange flames stabbing out of the casino windows.

Today,  even with hand-me-down memories of the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and the  advent of AIDS, it is hard to grasp the strain that the plague put on the physical and  spiritual fabric of society.  People went to bed perfectly healthy and were found dead in  the morning.  Priests and doctors who came to minister to the sick, so the wild stories  ran, would contract the plague with a single touch and die sooner than the person they  had come to help.

Impact of crime                Daylight Savings Time had extended the afternoon light, so there was plenty of  time left after church and lunch with a friend for my mother to work in the garden.  It  was a quiet Sunday in Princeton, N.J., last April 2, and showers had softened the  ground for planting.  It was not a time for murder...            But that Sunday my worst nightmare came true.  Someone jumped out of the  shadows and stabbed my mother five times in the back.  No one is sure why.  The killer  stole nothing, and quietly locked the door when leaving.  My mother's body wasn't  discovered until two days later.            The irony of my mother's death is that she was the type of citizen who is our first  line of defense in what has become the third largest crime wave in our nation's history.   She was actively involved in her community.  She knew who her neighbors were and  she watched out for them. …Princeton lost its immunity that day, becoming one less  town that can say, ""It can't happen here.""

It is necessary to take the time to listen, to wait for confidence to  become real and strong.

Impact of war                In 1996, 30 major armed conflicts raged in different locations around the world.   They took place within states, between factions split along ethnic, religious  and cultural lines.  In the past decade, an estimated 2 million children were killed in  armed conflict and three times as many seriously injured or permanently disabled.  There  is no way to measure the impact on a child who sees her family killed or to quantify  the emotional and psychological toll on children who live for years in fear of  bombings, mutilation or death.  In recent decades the proportion of war victims who are  civilians has leapt dramatically from 10 percent to more than 90 percent … The statistics  are shocking enough, but they suggest something worse. … More and more of the  world is being sucked into a desolate moral vacuum.  This is a space devoid of the most  basic human values; a space in which children are slaughtered, raped and maimed; a  space in which children are exploited as soldiers. … There are few further depths to  which humanity can sink.""                   _ Graca Machel, quoted by Frey-Wouters, E., ""Armed Conflict's Impact on  Children: A UN Report,""  Traumatic  StressPoints , Winter, 1997.      c.

Duration issues  •     Usually impact is rather lengthy  •     Postwar involvement may also be lengthy    D.      Diagramming a disaster by type   1.      The issues listed above involve, first, the causes of disaster _ natural,  industrial, technological, or human _ and second the elements of the disaster _ earth, air,  fire, water, or human.  These two factors help to describe the dominant forces of  concern in a specific disaster.  However, most disasters also involve  secondary forces.  For instance, an airplane crash may also involve explosions and fires  on the ground; a hurricane may be accompanied by flooding and may also result  in human violence in the aftermath; a technological disaster may result in fires,  disease, and illness over time.  Therefore, it is important as crisis responders go to  a disaster that they attempt to identify some of the critical issues that will occur  to the community in the immediate aftermath as well as in the long range.  This  involves identifying both dominant and secondary forces in any disaster situation.   2.      The outlining process.  a.       Determine whether the disaster is caused primarily by nature, industry or  technology or a human source.  b.       Identify the dominant element involved.  c.       List the issues relating to the dominant source and element.  d.       Determine the secondary sources in the disaster.  e.       Identify the secondary elements.  f.

Believability                 What was incapable of happening never happened, and what was capable  of happening is not a miracle...Consequently there are no miracles              _ Cicero           Many victims and survivors measure their reactions against a continuum of what is  believable about the disaster and what is unbelievable.       If the event is considered to be   impossible , then survivors may feel more anger and  less fear.  They are angry about the fact that something happened that could never have  happened, but they generally have little fear because they do not believe it will happen again.       If an event is considered   improbable  _ believable but not expectable _ then fear of  the unsafety of the world is increased, although fear of a repetition may be reduced.       The more  possible  the event is, the less the shock of sudden, unexpected danger.   However, even with the possible there is often anger because people think the possible  should have been impossible if protective devices could have been employed.       The more  probable  a disaster is, the less anger will be felt.  Many who knew they  were at risk may adjust their pre-disaster concerns to accommodate the possibility of  disaster and use that adjustment to reconcile their world view in the aftermath of the disaster.       There are  predictable  events that are perceived as disasters.  These differ from  possible or probable disasters since there is time for warning and a chance for choice.  If  adequate warning is given, there will be less likelihood of anger or fear in the aftermath, although  if individuals do not respond to the warning, there  may be guilt.  If adequate warning is not given, there will be exacerbated anger or fear.    VIII.  Distinguishing Features of Community Tragedy    A.      The extent of death and mayhem   1.      In most cases, the greater the number of dead or injured and the greater  the amount of carnage, the more likely that the tragedy will be perceived as  affecting a broad community.  2.      In some cases, the extent of death and mayhem will not be as relevant as who  is killed or injured.  Children attract extra concern and attention.  If a person  who has a special degree of public importance or a special position in the  community is killed, it may affect the community at large.  When President John F.  Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. were assassinated, millions in the nation were  united in shock and mourning.    B.      Massive dislocation and relocation.   1.      Home, school and workplace usually are invested with a sense of extended  personal identity.  The longer one has worked or lived in a particular place, the  more it is seen as an extension of self.  Fracturing that identity can be as  damaging emotionally as physical injury.  2.      If the dislocation or relocation involves establishing a temporary home in a  shelter or other facility, the strange surroundings may cause increased anxiety and  a sense of loss.  3.      The strangeness of new environments will be more strongly felt if pre-disaster  social networks are not able to be maintained.  C.      Unemployment, job loss, or severe individual financial losses.        Disasters that are accompanied by long-term unemployment or financial losses  can threaten the survival of individuals, families and communities.  Since employment is an  important part of many people's sense of social support, wide-scale layoffs or company  reorganizations can cause community-wide crisis.                Many of the Ramada Inn employees were left destitute in the aftermath of the  Air Force plane crash in Indianapolis.  Since they were in the hotel/restaurant  business, many received minimum wage and counted on tips to make a financial difference.   They did not pay large amounts into unemployment insurance and were unable to  collect    enough to meet post-disaster bills.  Some faced eviction and the inability to feed  their families.  They also experienced feelings of a fractured community because they  were a very close-knit employment community that would, in all likelihood, never  work together again.             _ Crisis Response Report, NOVA, November, 1987.       D.      Extent and kind of property destruction   1.      Wide-scale property destruction may demolish the physical  structure of  a community and thus change the landscape, transportation routes, and  normal routines.                Maj. Gen. Robert Moorehead, Commander of the Virgin Islands National  Guard, said of the scene on the morning after the storm, ""In all my military experience,  I had never seen anything like it.  It appeared to me that we had been the victims  of a nuclear blast.""            Not only was Christiansted strewn with uprooted trees, broken utility  poles, shattered cars and tons of debris from buildings that looked bombed, but the  verdant tropical island suddenly had turned brown.  So          strong were Hugo's winds that most trees still standing were shorn of leaves.            This desolate, end-of-the-world landscape and sense of isolation contributed  to the disorder that followed.             _ Branigan, W.,  ""A Slow Recovery from `12 Hours of Terror,' ""    The Washington Post , October 31, 1989.      2.      The destruction of ""indestructible"" property or the distortion of such  property may also overwhelm survivors.                Pieces of the fuselage _ some folded literally in an accordion pleat _ still  showed the orange, red, white and blue colors of United, as well as the black letters  spelling out the airline's name and the plane's number, N999UA. … ""Everything was in  that crater,"" [John] Lauber said, referring to a 9-1/2 foot deep hole that measured  about 24 feet by 39 feet. … The plane was compressed six times its normal density,  said NTSB spokesman Brent Bahler.  ""If you had to put all this back in the hole,  you couldn't.""               _ ""737 Careened Wildly Before Springs Crash,""    The Denver Post , March 6, 1991.      3.       Property that is destroyed in which survivors have invested sentimentality  may be a source of extreme grief.            One woman in the aftermath of the fires in the Black Hills near Rapid City,  South Dakota, wept over the complete destruction of her home.  But she wept more  because her only photographs of her son who had died at age 5 had been destroyed as well.""             _ Crisis Response Report, NOVA, August, 1988.      4.      Landmarks in the community, memorials, or community meeting places may  also hold special emotional value to community members.  If they are destroyed,  it may be the final blow that rips the community apart.    E.      Number of people affected        The more individuals involved as victims, survivors, helpers, bystanders, and the  like, the greater the community impact.  It is almost impossible to comprehend the numbers  involved in a massive disaster such as the Great Hanshin earthquake or the Oklahoma  City bombing.              … the physical extent of the damage caused by thebomb was much greater  than would be inferred from the focused publicity on the Murrah building.  In fact,  glass was broken in buildings two miles distant from the explosion; and the sound  and accompanying shock wave were sensed simultaneously by almost half a million  people. … Amongst the victims, 759 persons were injured, 167 [sic] fatally.   Eighty-eight percent of the occupants of the Murrah building were injured; and 19 children  were killed.  Utilizing a case definition of injury that required medical treatment in order  to qualify, 101 of the rescuers sustained injury, including one death. … Almost 40  percent of Oklahoma Citians knew someone who was killed or injured and 19 percent  reported attending one or more funerals for bombing victims.             _ ""Predictors of Perceived Recovery Among Oklahoma City Firefighters in  the Aftermath of Their Participation at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building"", Vincent,  R.D., Nixon, S.J., paper presented at 4th World Congress on Stress, Trauma, and Coping  in the Emergency Services Professions: Research and Practice, April 2-6, 1997.    F.      Sensationalism and voyeurism        Intrusions by media representatives or onlookers who are simply there to see the  rubble, or carnage, or grief of the community enhance the feelings of abandonment and anger  of survivors.  While people will turn to other community members for support, there will be  a great deal of resentment towards uninvited outsiders who have no positive assistance to  offer.              From time to time throughout the search, scenes of emotion and sometimes  ugly confrontation have been played out in and around the collapse.            Yesterday, members of two families awaiting word on the fate of loved ones  cried softly as they stood at the edge of the rubble near an American flag fluttering on a pole.   Outside Kolbe Cathedral High School nearby, another grieving family was  approached by a photographer.            ""Get that woman away from me,"" one member of the family screamed,  breaking into sobs. … a rescue worker asked for comment by a reporter turned suddenly, his  face flushed with anger.  ""I don't care where you're from or who you're with,""  he said.   ""Leave us alone!""               _ McFadden, R.D.,  ""Building Collapse Takes a Toll on Exhausted Rescue Workers,""    The New York Times , April 27, 1987.  G.      Depth of involvement of the community: relative loss and deprivation        If this has not been the worst thing that has happened to the community, the impact  of the latest disaster may not be perceived with the same intensity that an outside  observer may have projected.  However, if this is seen as the worst thing that has happened or  this represents an accumulation of disasters, it may be perceived as a representation of the  ""end of the world,"" or the recognition of an ultimate confrontation with evil.         Clay Foreman describes this perception in the aftermath of an accident in which a  freestanding tower crane at a San Francisco building site collapsed and killed four  construction workers and a school bus driver, and injured twenty-two others on November 19, 1989.   This was two months after the Loma Prieta Earthquake.  In the following conversation,  the worker's family was in a shelter.  Eght hours before, he had witnessed another worker  drive a truck off the top of the construction site and crash 100 feet below.  Foreman recounts  the dialogue between a counselor (C) and  the construction worker (W) ""who seemed to  believe the end of the world was at hand.""              C.      This is a horrible scene, right here on this structure.            W.      Matthew 24 says, ""The two men will be in the field:  one will be taken and  the other left.""  [His reference appeared to relate to the random deaths on the structure.]            C.      Armageddon, the final destruction before the second coming of Christ.  Is  that what you are talking about?            W.      [Referring to the sky.] The lightning comes from the east and flashes to the  west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.            C.      Where is Christ?            W.      In heaven sitting at the right hand of God the Father.  See the lightning.  It  starts there and travels there. … Lightning comes from the east and travels to the west,  just like it says in Matthew 24.  [His voice had risen from a whisper to a shout.]            Lightning in the east was reflected on the edges of breaks in the clouds to the west.   The moon had disappeared.             _ Foreman, C., ""Immediate Post-Disaster Treatment,"" in   Handbook of Post-Traumatic Therapy , Williams, M.B. and Sommer, J.F., Jr., Greenwood Press, CT, 1994.    H.      The ""star"" effect: compounding stress within and across social  circles   [see chart, next page]       The chart illustrates how the individual crisis reaction is multiplied horizontally  across the community.  While an individual tragedy may affect the individual and his loved  ones, the effect of a community trauma is that each individual and his loved ones  are affected, but they, in turn, react to and affect others who are also suffering from the same trau-ma.  The  direct victim becomes one of many co-victims.  Multiple reactions occur in different forms and at  different times.              ""The … the … your mother's plane … it crashed, Shep.  It crashed on takeoff at  Orly, and I'm afraid they're all gone. … One hundred and six members of the Art Association.   One hundred and fourteen people from Georgia.  A hundred and twenty-nine in  all…"" [I walked into Mayor Ben Cameron's office]  His face was bone-white beneath  the permanent tan and the scattering of dark freckles across his cheekbones, and the  flesh of it looked stretched and flayed, almost hanging from his thin, good bones.  He  looked older by years than I had ever seen him, and his gray eyes were almost as red and  swollen as his daughter's had been that morning.  For the first time I thought what  exquisite anguish he must be living.  Not only had he lost nearly a hundred of the people who  were the mainstays of his life, but he must bury his own grief deep and act with coolness,  grace and authority for their families and the city at large; swallow his own pain that  theirs might be more quickly assuaged. … It would be a long time before Ben Cameron  could weep, or even sleep.  ""Ah, God, no,"" he said, and his voice broke.  ""Christ, Shep,  this was … my entire generation.  I grew up with most of these folks.  Laura Rainey was  the first date I ever had; we went to a swimming party at Sibley French's house, and she  had a two-piece bathing suit.  We all talked about that for weeks.  And If I hadn't met  Dorothy I probably would have married Jane Ellen Alexander.  And the first time I ever got  drunk _ practically the last _ was with Tommy Burns, up at Tate one Fourth of July, on  sloe gin.

And, in a way it was…              _Siddons, Anne Rivers,   Peachtree Road , New York, NY, Harper & Row, 1988.      I.      The ""pinball"" effect, whereby stresses bounce well beyond the immediate  place of crisis into history  [see chart, next page]       The chart illustrates how the crisis effects change over time.  The individual crisis  reaction may subside more quickly than a community reaction.  For the community in trauma, there  is a reinforcement of the crisis even when it is a reinforcement of disillusionment.   Estrangement, isolation and anger may cause irreparable rifts between the support systems and  may cause total community reformation.  It may also reshape history, values, and attitudes in  ways which reinterpret the present as well as the past.                Michael Holquist, a comparative literature professor who chairs Yale's Council  on Russian and East European Studies, recently watched two videotapes that focused  on Bosnia.  One highlighted Bosnian Serbs involved in ""ethnic cleansing,"" the other  was devoted to some of their victims, Bosnian Muslims who have resettled in New Haven  and whose testimonies are compiled into an archive similar to that for Holocaust survivors.   ""Accounts of trauma are never pretty, but some stories are more horrifying than  others,"" says Holquist.  ""These were particularly grisly.""            The Serbian soldiers, noted the scholar, kept bringing up Kosovo, the site of  numerous battles more than 500 years ago, each of which was mentioned to fan the flames  of nationalism.  ""There's a timeless world of Serbian glory that's caught up in the  Kosovo epic,"" says Holquist.  ""The way it is constantly being invoked to justify the  unthinkable demonstrates the way a subject in the present negotiates the past.""                 _Fellman, B. ""The Pathways of Pain,"" Yale Alumni   Magazine, New Haven, CT.  Yale Alumni Publications, March, 1995.  J.      Multiple histories        In a community situation, each individual brings to the crisis his or her own history.   In addition, each may bring a history of a former community crisis.  And finally, the  community brings its own history.  The community and subcommunities all have their own  personalities and histories.  They, in turn, compound the history of the individual.  It is not  unusual for such other traumas to surface during group and individual crisis intervention  efforts.              Dryden High School students came to class Monday morning after a  weekend speculation about the whereabouts of two teens.  By mid-morning, they had  learned that their worst fears were true. … evidence had been recovered to suggest the  girls were dead. … ""It was unbelievable hysteria … you just can't grasp the gravity of  what's happened.""            This tragedy was only the latest to hit the school district in recent years, with  several occurring within the last months. … Monday's news of two more violent deaths  brought numbing shock to many of the nearly 15,000 town residents.             _ Wilensky, J. and Zito, K.A., "" `I can't believe I won't be seeing them again'  Grief overwhelms Dryden School,""   The Ithaca  Journal , October 8, 1996.         It is also not uncommon for a series of trauma histories to collate in the minds of  a community to produce community-wide crisis and sometimes a drive for change.              Although it was the death of 15-year-old Kylie Smith that became the catalyst  for a massive petition, hers wasn't the only death that has outraged New Zealanders.   We have been sickened by murders such as the killing of 6-year-old Theresa Cormack  in Napier, Kirsa Jensen also of Napier, taken from her house in broad daylight with  her body still remaining unrecovered.  The schoolgirl Karla Cardano, abducted  and murdered after visiting a dairy in the Lower Hutt suburb of Taita; Louisa  Damadran, a little girl killed and thrown into a river in Christchurch.  Another small child,  Sarah Currie of Invercargill, who was sexually molested and murdered in the inner sanctuary  of her own home.  These are but a handful of the dreadful crimes that spring to mind in  New Zealand, a country we are so proud of.            Disgraceful as all of these crimes are, it seems that the outrage on Kylie  Smith was what tipped the balance.             _O'Brien, B.,  Shattered  Dreams , Birkenhead, Auckland, David Ling  Publishing, Ltd.,  1996.    K.      Immobilization of helpers        Caregivers are often immobilized by the same shock, disbelief and denial that afflicts  direct victims or survivors.  Hence, their helping mechanisms and techniques may not  be implemented as quickly or efficiently.     L.      Politics and the chaos of disaster organizations        Perhaps one of the most problematic issues in the immediate aftermath of  catastrophe is community politics.  The question of ""who is in charge"" is compounded by the fact  that normal responding agencies may be in chaos, but also may be reluctant to let anyone  else seize the credit.  Leadership may become fragmented and the normal bonding for  survival may be interfered with as survivors worry about who gets the credit for rescue operations  or other actions.              The obstacles put up by government bureaucracy took a terrible toll … Offers of  help came pouring in from 76 nations and districts, as well as from the United Nations  and the World Health Organization.  Incredibly, the Japanese government either  turned them down or delayed aid with time-squandering bureaucratic procedures.  As  people lay dying undiscovered in the wreckage, officials spent one whole day debating a  Swiss offer to fly in 20 trained sniffer dogs _ and then accepted only 12.  A French team  of trauma specialists, also belatedly admitted, were not allowed to work at all because  they lacked certain Japanese medical qualifications.               _ Elliott, Lawrence, ""Earthquake at Dawn,""     Reader's Digest , November, 1995.              It was apparent that there was absolutely no coordination among the twenty-two  or so agencies who were involved in the aftermath of this disaster.  There was a kind  of confusion as to where responsibilities lay and it was also apparent that various  territorial battles were being fought on the back of a terrible tragedy.             _ [In the aftermath of the downing of TWA Flight 800] O'Flaherty, J.,  ""Handling Catastrophe Despite Official Help,""    Airport Press , September, 1996.    VII. Conclusion        In examining the nature of catastrophe one is struck by the fact that tragedies happen  and that survival depends upon our ability to reconnect with a community.  That community  may be one that existed prior to the disaster or it may be created by the disaster itself.   Lewis Mumford's words seem to describe that need and prescribe our responsibilities:                The very extension of the range of community in our time, through national  and worldwide organizations, only increases the need for building up, as never before,  the intimate cells, the basic tissue, of social life; the family and the home, the  neighborhood and the city, the work-group and the factory.   © 1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.

The investment will              help fight poverty by expanding access to micro-loans for low-income              entrepreneurs, mostly women, helping them build their businesses and              raise their standard of living.             FINCA Kyrgyzstan              is a highly successful USAID-supported microfinance provider with              a 99 percent repayment rate. Established with a $6.2 million grant              from USAID in 1995, FINCA Kyrgyzstan is now financially sustainable              and expects to obtain a license, under pending law in the Kyrgyz Republic,              to become the first microfinance institution in the country to serve              the poor with both loan and saving products. To date, it has lent              over $43 million in funds.             Khosrow Zamani,              IFC's Director for Southern Europe and Central Asia, said, ""We              feel that FINCA Kyrgyzstan's success rate on repayment makes it a              prime candidate for transition to a commercially sustainable institution.              A successful transition will help expand access to the vital micro-loans              that help micro-entrepeneurs build their businesses and improve their              lives.""             The IFC investment              will help FINCA Kyrgyzstan transition to a regulated, commercially-based,              microfinance institution. The Kyrgyz government fully supports this              objective and is currently reviewing new regulations that would support              the establishment of commercial microfinance institutions.              Microfinance              involves the provision of a broad range of financial services to low-income              households that operate microenterprises. Microfinance is a proven,              effective tool in the fight against poverty. The poor have displayed              a capability to repay loans, pay the real cost of loans, and generate              savings that are reinvested in their business. Income earned through              microenterprises enables families to increase their spending on education,              health care and improved nutrition.             More than 500              million poor people around the world run profitable microenterprises              and often cite credit as the primary constraint to business growth.              In the poorest countries, these activities constitute the private              sector-generating jobs and resources for services crucial to poverty              reduction, especially for women. Nearly 90 percent of FINCA Kyrgyzstan's              cumulative total of $43 million in loans since its inception in 1995              has gone to Kyrgyz women.             Back              to Top                         Successful              Advocacy Campaign against Government Resolution No. 20             On May 25, to              the relief of local NGOs, independent media and the international              donor community, Kyrgyz President Akayev terminated Resolution 20              “On Some Issues of Publishing Activities.” This was a              welcome decision, since several provisions in the resolution directly              contradicted the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic and provisions              of international law protecting freedom of speech and the right to              disseminate information. The resolution, for example, required the              registration of all fax machines, copiers, scanners and other equipment              that could be used for publishing activities and required prior certification              for any publishing activity.                            The president’s decision to recall Resolution 20 was shaped,              in part, by the tremendous outcry against the resolution. Immediately              after the resolution came into effect, the Parliament’s Committee              for Public Associations and Information Policies warned the public              and the international community about the danger of the resolution              and protested against it.             Local NGOs and              USAID’s implementing partners the International Center for Not-for-Profit              Law (ICNL), the National Democratic Institute (NDI), Counterpart Consortium,              Internews, and the American Bar Association (ABA/CEELI) moved swiftly              to organize and lobby against the resolution. At the request of the              Committee for Public Associations and Information Policies, ICNL provided              its commentary on the said resolution to the government. The commentary              was posted on the USAID-sponsored Central Asia NGO website, www.cango.net.kg,              which has 2,000 subscribers representing the mass media and NGOs.             NDI, Counterpart              Consortium and Internews selected a day of action – a “Repeal              Decree 20” day – to galvanize the community against the              resolution. To prepare for the event, they disseminated ICNL’s              commentary on the resolution to partner NGOs and spread the word about              the day of advocacy campaign.             The Association              of Lawyers of Kyrgyzstan (ALK), with ABA/CEELI support, sent a strong              message, as well. ABA/CEELI initiated a roundtable with local partners,              including ALK, to discuss the resolution. After the meeting, ALK delivered              legal commentaries to the resolution to the Kyrgyz president and the              government. As a result, the government created a working group, in              which ALK members participated, to reconsider Resolution 20.             Counterpart’s              Civil Society Support Centers and the local NGO Interbilim took the              lead to launch an effective advocacy campaign. 42 roundtables discussing              the Resolution and its affect on civil society were held throughout              the country. Over 800 representatives from the mass media, NGOs and              government officials of all levels participated in these roundtables              and signed declarations against the resolution. The declarations were              delivered to Bishkek and addressed to the President, Prime Minister              and Parliament. Prominent public figures and intellectuals unanimously              protested against the resolution at the national press conference,              which was broadcast nationwide. The advice provided by ICNL's local              expert helped NGOs and mass media representatives effectively address              their concerns with the government.              While Resolution              20 has been terminated, it is important for the NGO community to remain              on alert. The President's Decree of May 25 did not simply annul the              resolution, but authorized the government to take “effective              actions to regulate publishing activities in the Kyrgyz Republic based              on the constitution and current legislation.” This may result              in new attempts by the government to restrict publishing activities              and curb the development of civil society.

""These new documents uncovered recently in Enron's Portland office provide strong confirmation that West Coast energy markets were harmed by price manipulations and distortions by a number of players,"" Lockyer said. ""While we continue to aggressively pursue our energy investigation in the West, we believe it important to make these Enron documents available for congressional hearings into Enron's business conduct and pricing practices.""    The Enron documents include handwritten notes from company meetings in early October 2000 describing power trading strategies used to drive up prices in California's energy market. The strategies were described by Tim Belden, head of Enron's West Coast trading operations. The Enron meetings were held to prepare for investigations and subpoenas of the company. The strategies later described in the December 6 and 8, 2000 memos were called such things as ""Death Star,"" ""Get Shorty,"" ""Fat Boy"" and ""Ricochet.""   ""The documents provide a number of avenues to follow, including references to Williams and Powerex as 'hogs at the trough',"" Lockyer said. The Attorney General filed civil complaints in April against Williams and Powerex for overcharges in the California markets.

GX236-39-4503450	"Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Chapter Three: The Trauma Response: External Factors I. Sensory Inputs from Event The nature of sensory information and its strength when people encounter a traumatic event may relate both to the developmental stage of the individuals as well as previous life experience. For instance, a small child may react more to a sense of smell than an adult because the olfactory senses develop first in the growth of brain structures. For most adults, the visual or auditory senses are the strongest initial perceptions, but visual perceptions are often critical to the eventual formation of a narrative. Seeing apparently dominates all other senses following trauma because it is the sense by which most horrible episodes are recorded and reviewed in the mind. Traumatic ""tapes"" are almost always replayed by victims in silent video  not in audio or even in ""smellovision."" Even in cases where a traumatic episode begins in an entirely blinded way ... the event may eventually transform itself into ""sight.""  Terr, Too Scared to Cry. The immediate impact of sensory information is affected by the proximity of an individual to the trauma. It is also affected by prior experience. If a particular taste, smell, touch, sight or sound has previously been associated with threat and danger, the neuronal connection is already established and it is reactivated by the current experience. It is likely that repeated exposure to such threat will both increase sensitization to the sensory information as well as mute response. Since the senses are the primary source of information, they become the foundation for memory of what happened.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-1  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  II. Chronology of the Event and the Individual's Participation in the Chronology Understanding the perception of time and its relation to trauma reactions is crucial since the sense of time helps the brain organize and transcribe feelings and thoughts. Fitting a frightening event into ""time,"" either personal time or world time, helps a person to cope with that event. Seeing, furthermore, how sequences of events work together and how long events will last also helps prevent any flooding of the psyche. Feeling rhythms, in addition, helps maintain a person's sense of balance. If all of these time awarenesses fail, however, to prevent a person from becoming traumatized, the person's time sense will undergo some damage. ... As a ""stimulus barrier,"" in other words, time functions both as a protection against damage and as a marker of the damage.  Terr, Too Scared to Cry. The use of chronology to form a cognitive narrative for a story of events is helpful to victims. It is also helpful if they can comprehend the circumstances of the event and their involvement in it as they seek order and meaning in their world. It is useful for crisis responders to try to sort out the stages of the event and the roles that victims played in the event as they listen to victims' stories. Some of the issues associated with the chronological recounting of the story will involve the following stages of disaster as interpreted by individuals and the community: A. Pre-disaster equilibrium The community equilibrium before a disaster is defined by cultural transitions or tensions, previous disaster history, or political, economic, or historical tensions. That equilibrium and the effect of stressors on it is similar to that of an individual. The pre-disas-  3-2   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  ter equilibrium has been established as a balance between existing stressors and the adaptive capacity of a community to such stressors. B. Warning and threat These stages for all intents and purposes often are merged in our understanding. Certainly they may be experienced differently by different people. However, objectively, there is a distinct difference. The warning period is characterized by anxiety, wariness, and wonder. There may be excitement tempered by high vigilance. Post-disaster reactions to what happened during this period may involve concerns of evacuation and shelter. Most communities experience warnings of potential disasters on a regular basis. Tornado warnings, flood warnings, and hurricane warnings are all a part of continuing community life in many parts of the country. If individuals or communities experience such warnings, they develop plans of action for evacuation, shelter, or care in the event of a disaster. They also experience a growing acceptance of the warnings and a gradual denial of the imminence of the disaster. That denial is exacerbated when the community or individual has more immediate needs  financial, emotional, or political. Repeated warnings along with sporadic impacts of a certain kind of event often are the foundation of a ""disaster subculture."" Disaster subcultures emerge when there have been repetitive disaster impacts, periodic warnings of disaster, and the community's knowledge and recognition of consequential damage from the disaster event. Many individuals who live in disaster subcultures cope in the aftermath of the impact of a ""predictable"" disaster by relying upon their cognitive understanding that they had a choice in whether to live in the area or not. Recognition of pre-disaster choices made on an assessment of the risks can ameliorate stress and help to define future action. In disaster subcultures, organizational elements of  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-3  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  a community may provide a degree of effective prediction, control, and response. However, individual alarm systems may have been weakened by denial, lack of interest, or competing anxieties or concerns. This was illustrated in the disaster in Aberfan, Wales, on October 21, 1966, when 140,000 cubic yards of colliery rubbish swept down Methyr Mountain and killed 116 children, 5 teachers, 23 other adults, injured 35 people, and destroyed two schools and many houses. The village had noted changes in the slag pile days before the disaster and there had been warnings over the course of 40 years prior to the catastrophe. Since the village was dependent economically on the Aberfan mine, there was an element of willful blindness in refraining from taking extra safety measures. There appeared to be a greater anxiety about the thought of losing jobs than from some contingent fear of disaster.  Howe, ""The Aberfan Disaster,"" Medico-Legal Journal, 1968. Examples of disaster subcultures include the following.  Israel: This description depicts the reaction of a family returning to the United States for a visit after moving to Israel. Israel is often besieged by violent acts, but it is significant that in many cases, its citizens have chosen to reside there and have accommodated the threats of such violence through a disaster subculture of attitudes, behaviors, and norms. The Rosenfelds have reached the Mall intact. They are eating popcorn as they amble towards the National Museum of History. One of the children goes over to a trash can and looks inside before depositing the empty  3-4   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  popcorn cup. An identical carton litters the path. The child eyes it and leaves it there, earning a disdainful glare from a passerby who demonstratively picks it up and tosses it into the trash. The child immediately hangs her head and brings her right shoulder up in a decidedly foreign gesture, holding this pose for a count of three. This is the defensive posture of an unrepentant Israeli child of any ethnic background who is confronted by an accusing adult. In this case it is the body language of a kid who would no more handle a discarded popcorn cup  or pick up a wallet on the street or kick a Pepsi can whose chain of custody has not been established  than she would accept a ride from a passing stranger with a pocketful of candy. ... Sure, it's a war mentality. Coping with unremitting violence carries a heavy cost. But, looking back, I feel that we adjusted to terror better than we knew. We opened our handbags and turned out our pockets before we entered public places and we got used to the sight of middleaged druggists or lawyers in the uniforms of civil guard patrol. If, after an attack on a school bus, our kids' tour of nature preserves was cancelled, we  and they  took it in stride.""  Judith Rosenfeld, ""Home from the Mideast: Terrorism's Long Grip,"" The Washington Post, January 20, 1991.  California: People who live in earthquake or hurricane zones also seem to accommodate themselves to ever-present threat when it is expected and they have had choice in their situation. They wrap themselves in foxhole bravado and think little about where the next one may hit. It's hard to get them to read preparedness manuals, buy disaster insurance or even carry a simple survival kit of drinking water and bandages. A kind of massive denial operates for Californians  one way of living sanely in a place  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-5  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  whose beguiling contours are known to harbor a calamitously unruly force of nature.  Gelman, ""Coping with Quake Fear,"" Newsweek, October 30, 1989. Such a disaster subculture may compound feelings of anger or guilt by survivors after a disaster hits even as it also makes them less responsive to warnings of threat. Planners developing action guides for responding to such threats should know some of the pitfalls in communicating with disaster subcultures. What makes a warning credible? First, warning messages need to identify the source of the information contained in the warning and include a mixture of references such as public officials, scientists, or experts in the field of disaster. These messages will be perceived as more relevant than others because of the source of the message. Second, it is useful to warn people through multiple communication channels. Seeing a warning on television is confirmed by hearing a warning on the radio or reading about a warning in the newspaper  it involves different sensory perceptions at different times. Third, the content of the warning should include a description of what is going to happen, where the danger exists, and how severe the potential impact may be. This helps the mind put the threat into an organized cognition. Finally, warnings should provide descriptions of specific and simple protective measures that those in risk may use to protect themselves. Threat occurs when warning involves knowledge of imminent danger and potential death. Threat may last for brief moments or hours of time. Many people experience the impact of the disaster itself in the preimpact stage of threat. Their reactions are triggered by the threat even when the feared threat does not occur. Hence, it is important to understand those reactions, the impact of appraisal of threats and coping responses.  3-6   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Today's understandings of the role of appraisal of threats and ultimate coping strategies still rests significantly on the theories developed by Lazarus and Folkman (New York: Springer Publishing) in 1984. In their book, Stress, Appraisal and Coping, they define coping as ""...constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person..."" This definition fits well within the Maslow Model of response to trauma in Chapter One. While these coping or stress responses are examined in more detail below, the significance of the appraisal itself on the ultimate coping responses has been studied relatively little. Lazarus and Folkman write about cognitive appraisals that determine, first, if events are relevant, benefits to the individual, or stressors. Stressors are defined as threats, losses, or challenges. What studies have been done seem to suggest that people responding to loss rely upon emotional coping skills such as expression of feelings and social support; individuals responding to threats may rely upon wishful thinking or religious coping skills such as wanting to be over what happened, believing that things can return to normal, or relying upon God or faith for help; and those responding to challenging situations focus on problem-solving or optimism, such as action planning or looking for positive outcomes of the stress. (McCrae, R.R., ""Situational determinants of coping responses: Loss, threat, and challenge,"" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1984; Bjorck, J.P., & Cohen, L.H., ""Coping with threats, losses and challenges,"" Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 1993; Bjorck, J.P., & Klewicki, L.L., ""The Effects of Stressor Type on Projected Coping"", Journal of Traumatic Stress Studies, July, 1997). These distinctions in the impact of the appraisals of stress and the possible combination in disasters of cumulative appraisals of loss, threat and challenge may be interesting considerations in responding to survivors after an event. Responders may want to try  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-7  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  to understand the retrospective perceptions by survivors of their appraisal of the potential catastrophe prior to impact. The study of these stress responses has increased markedly over the last decade. Several patterns have been identified. There is the emotion-focused response strategy, the problem-focused response strategy, and an avoidance or disengagement strategy. The latter strategy may incorporate both of the other strategies. The emotion-focused strategy may be the most efficient in what is perceived as uncontrollable circumstances. It is an attempt to reduce or eliminate the emotional distress caused by the situation. However, some studies suggest that while this may be the most effective way to handle immediate emergencies where individuals feel powerless, it may also put the survivors at higher risk for long-term trauma. The problem-focused strategy aims at removing the source of the threat. It is usually employed by individuals who see some latitude that allows for considering options and taking action. Such individuals often are able to integrate what happened in the disaster more quickly into their life story since their actions helped them make a productive transition through the catastrophe to the present. Disengagement may be a process that allows the survivors to take a break from the threat while beginning to plan for problem-focused responses in the future. At times, this has been called ""blunting."" It may be associated with the release of opiates in the brain and the mediating effect of serotonin in monitoring stress hormones. It is manifested at times in denial of the event or the event's impact. Blunting may be an alternative coping mechanism to an emotionfocused strategy, but may also put survivors at higher risk for long-term stress reactions. A study of coping responses among Israeli University students was made during the 1991 Gulf War. The students were given a warning period of one-anda-half minutes, during which they fled into a sealed  3-8   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  room and stayed there while Scud missiles, possibly carrying deadly chemical agents, attacked. Three sets of coping activities observed. The instrumental response  involving communicating with others, safety checks with each other, and helping others  were most common. An emotional response  feeling tense, trembling, or asking for a hug  was the next most common. Almost as common was the blunting response, defined as making fun of the situation or thinking of pleasant things. The latter two responses did not correlate with the instrumental response, and it is suggested that the instrumental response was implemented first and that, after everything was done that could be done, the other response options kicked in. (Klingman, Avigdor, & Kuper-mintz, Hagai, ""Response Style and Self-Control Under Scud Missile Attacks: The Case of the Sealed Room Situation During the 1991 Gulf War,"" Journal of Traumatic Stress, July, 1994) These response studies to the threat of imminent danger are helpful because they also relate to coping behaviors in the aftermath as control of the situation becomes more possible. Community crisis responders have an obligation to help communities be prepared and vigilant about potential disaster. This means developing the skills and tools with which to respond when a disaster occurs; educating community members on crisis and trauma reactions; as well as developing a disaster plan for providing appropriate emotional aftercare. C. Impact 1. Timing Many victims and survivors think in retrospect that they had no warning of the danger. While this may be true, often such people simply do not comprehend the danger because the shock is so overwhelming and the timing of the threat adds to its unreality. For instance, when awoken from sleep, people may not be ready to respond appropriately. The suddenness of sleep interruption may cause  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-9  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  them to feel even more isolated. The abrupt departure from routine may also cause a mental shock wave when a disaster occurs. 2. Time warp The effect of trauma on one's sense of time is dramatic. While animals have an innate knowledge of time, it seems to relate to the sense of light and degree of temperature such that they develop routines based upon when they can hunt, migrate, sleep, hibernate, or mate. In the human species, the sense of time extends itself through a knowledge of past, present and future in a linear extension that not only includes comprehension of history but a projection of a future. This sense of time is refined developmentally as it becomes correlated with motion, rhythm, and, eventually, ""clock time."" When a traumatic event occurs, the ""clock time"" seems to cease and traumatized individuals go through a time warp. At impact, victims often feel time stops. Mariann Hybels-Steer recalled a beating in a riot in the following way: I don't know how long it lasted. It seemed fast. It seemed slow. It seemed like the blink of an eye. It seemed like an eternity. Time compressed. Time elongated.  Hybels-Steer, M., Aftermath  Survive and Overcome Trauma, Simon & Schuster, 1995. When the sense of time resumes, it usually is experienced as if life were progressing in slow motion or at an extremely fast pace. The less control a person has during the crisis, the more likely that the crisis will be perceived as lasting a long time. The more control someone has, the more likely that the crisis will be compacted into what is perceived as a brief moment or moments of reaction.  3-10   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  In order to unravel the happening of an event, survivors must try to fit the event into a time sequence. A chronology seems to help individuals protect themselves against the extent of damage caused by the trauma. If time seems to stop, the cessation seems to allow the mind to be inundated by perception and to stop the mind's ability to comprehend the event. The perceptions, however, may become vividly imprinted in traumatic memory. The understanding of time includes senses of rhythm, duration, sequence, and perspective. These senses help to order life. When the these senses are suspended, people may also stop adhering to everyday routines (usually governed by time) and rules or laws. If everything is perceived as chaos or as operating in a vacuum, why continue to obey order? Survivors are in an unreal but animated state. Time is suspended, as are normality, rules, and laws. One is no longer accountable to the previous social structure because that structure no longer exists. There are practical aspects to this and there are moral aspects:  Practical aspects: not going to work on time, social routines being disrupted, experiencing a coma-like state which is accompanied by temporary amnesic blanks in memory and understanding; losing sense of hours, days, and weeks.  Moral aspects: the suspension of rules, laws, and order may contribute to the rise in violence during or after the disaster. Voyeurs or looters may see nothing wrong in trespassing and stealing if everything is destroyed already. Sexual assault and rape may be accepted as normal. Murder may not be illegal but mandatory under certain circumstances.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-11  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  For the common soldier ... war has the feel  the spiritual texture  of a great ghostly fog, thick and permanent. There is no clarity. Everything swirls. The old rules are no longer binding, the old truths no longer true. Right spills over into wrong. Order blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law into anarchy, civility into savagery. The vapors suck you in. You can't tell where you are, or why you're there, and the only certainty is overwhelming ambiguity. In war you lose your sense of the definite, hence your sense of truth itself, and therefore it's safe to say that in a true war story nothing is ever absolutely true.  Tim O'Brien, combat veteran, ""The Things They Carried,"" 1990 in Trauma and Recovery, Herman, J., 1992. 3. Duration of the event Even as the perception of time is distorted, the actual time elapsed during the impact of the event on the sensory perceptions, emotional and cognitive brain structures, and community will affect the severity of the trauma reaction. The longer that any of the following periods last, the greater the intensity of the experience of crisis.  Duration of immediate life-threatening event. The quicker one is removed from the threat and emotions are calmed, the less likely that the event will remain worrisome. There may remain an emotional memory of the event and the fear or anger that was caused, but that trace may not have solidified into chemical or hormonal changes in the brain messaging system.  Duration of ongoing survival concerns. Even if the immediate threat has been removed, if survivors are left in a state where they continue to feel that their or their loved ones' lives are threatened by ongoing danger, they may continue to associate and reassociate the event with danger.  3-12   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes   Duration of sensorial involvement. Threat may be reduced and survival may be assured, but the longer survivors are in contact with sensory information that reminds them of the event, the more likely they will integrate those reminders with their emotional map of the trauma.  Duration of morbid preoccupation by a community. The impact of a community's response to the event can exacerbate anxieties and trauma reactions. People look to their society and their culture to confirm or deny what has occurred. When a community is traumatized, the communal entity tends to process the crisis in a similar way to each individual but the crisis reaction is multiplied exponentially by each member 's experience. If the community dwells on the trauma as an aberration from communal life and does not seek to integrate it into its history, or if a community reprocesses the traumatic reaction over and over without developing a strategy for the future, individuals in the community may have their own trauma elongated by a lack of support or understanding of the need to continue to function and grow. On the other hand, if the community acknowledges the event and the trauma, and assists individuals in connecting with each other and finding meaning to the event, people are often able to successfully survive and thrive. 4. Low point versus no low point issues There is a point in time in most disasters when one can assess the total casualties or damage. That may be referred to as the low point of the disaster. However, for certain types of disasters, such as health epidemics, environmental spills, chemical or nuclear accidents, it may be impossible to assess the total damage during a lifetime. Such disasters are referred to as ""no low point disasters."" They have a beginning  the sudden  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-13  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  knowledge of threat or danger, and they have a middle, the ongoing upheaval caused by the chronic threat. They don't have a foreseeable end. Examples of no low-point disasters include the plague in Europe when from 1347-1400 over onethird of Europe's population died; the current HIV/AIDS epidemic; the Three Mile Island nuclear accident; and the Exxon-Valdez oil spill. The nuclear explosion at Chernobyl in Russia is a similar disaster. Its long-term damage and effects are illustrated in the following: ""...how harmful will chronic radiation prove to be? There are many indications that steady low-level doses of increased radiation have a cumulative effect on cells and chromosomes. Only time  and generations  will reveal what damage Chernobyl really caused.... Life itself will be the evidence,"" said Dr. Alexander Urinan, a surgeon I visited at Kiev's Children Hospital Number 14. ""Seven years after the accident, we're now starting to observe the effects we feared."" Urinan confirmed that thyroid cancers in Ukraine and Belarus, especially among the children who received a dose of radioactive iodine from the initial blast, have far surpassed the numbers predicted. It is also clear that the immune systems of many children of Chernobyl, even those born far from the reactor, have become so depressed that old diseases like diphtheria are now reappearing. ""We're seeing newborn children with liver and stomach cancers,"" Urinan said. The hospital has also reported record numbers of babies born with cleft palates, deformed limbs, and missing rectums. ""We can't tell what to expect when affected children who are now adolescents begin to give birth ... "" ~~[Need end and citation  Smithsonian] Kai Erikson refers to the special trauma of such catastrophes as a trauma that is inculcated with ""dread."" (Erikson, K., ""Toxic Reckoning:  3-14   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Business Faces a New Kind of Fear,"" Harvard Business Review, January-February, 1990) With low point disasters, there is a point when people know that things can get better. They can describe the worst. They can complete their story and develop their truth. In no-low point disasters, anger vacillates to outrage, back to anger, to repressed anger, and simulated apathy. It may never subside. Fear is a constant  dread haunts the survivor's life. The question is how to learn to cope with constant fear instead of how to reestablish a sense of safety. D. Inventory The inventory stage of a disaster takes place immediately after the initial impact. Survivors who have been the victim of sudden, immediate trauma often experience a period of time in which there is silence. The silence is usually deceptive. Observers at a disaster scene may witness the noise of ambulances or natural forces, but the survivors and responders to the disaster may hear nothing. ""There were little bodies in piles dotted around the room and items of children's clothing like shoes around the floor,"" said the first ambulance man to reach Dunblane Primary School. ""The strange thing was the virtual silence that we encountered as we walked in. Children were just sitting there in total shock with bullet wounds to their limbs and bodies, unable to cry out or speak."" ~~[Need citation ]Dunblane (population 9,000), Scotland, March 13, 1996 - Massacre in which 16 students and their teacher were killed. This state of silence compounds the sense of isolation and abandonment that many victims experience in the midst of tragedy. Their disorientation is increased if the result of the catastrophe is darkness or  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-15  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  it takes place in darkness. Individuals need to have affirmation that the tragedy has happened and that they are still connected to the world. The inventory stage is also the time when survivors make their first assessment of the amount of harm that has occurred. The usual progression of assessment is to find out whether they are injured, whether loved ones are injured or dead, and the extent of property damage or loss. First responders and survivors are often in the position of making immediate triage decisions at the scene. Afterwards, they may discover ""mistakes"" made about who, when and how to rescue. These discoveries may be the cause of additional guilt, self-blame, depression, or anguish. The inventory may extend into stages of rescue and remedy. This is particularly true of no low-point disasters. Richard Williams is the buildings manager for the Federal offices here [Oklahoma City], and he was in the Federal Building when the bomb went off. A rescue worker found him, took his pulse and found none, and left him for dead. But later, he was told, another rescuer heard him moaning and carried him out. His right hand was smashed and his right ear was left hanging by cartilage, among other injuries.  Bragg, Richard, ""In Oklahoma City, Recovery a House at a Time,"" The New York Times, Sunday, June 8, 1997 E. Rescue The period of rescue should be thought of initially in terms of meeting victims' emergency survival needs and then securing their mental and emotional senses of safety. It may last for a few minutes or days while rescuers work to assist victims find physical, financial, and emotional safety. 1. Emergency physical response First responders must focus on emergency  3-16   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  physical concerns. Physical safety and survival must be assured as much as possible as soon as possible. However, other life, or connections to life, must be sustained as well. Safety and survival of farm animals, pets, or plants may be of great concern. Many survivors seek to save historical or sentimental property  relevant to both individuals and community. Ron and Debbie Umbdenstock believe that they have sacrificed their 100-year-old farmhouse and the last of their chickens for the greater good of their village... The couple's property lies in the path of a slowmoving, man-made flood that was unleashed... If the strategy works, the flood gushing south from a levee break upriver...would be diverted through the broken section and directed back into the Mississippi... The diversion takes pressure off a main levee along Prairie du Rochur creek and, everyone hopes, it protects the 250-year-old town of quaint inns and French restaurants from the worst of the rushing waters.  Pressley, Sue Ann, ""Town in Harm's Way Tries to Detour a Juggernaut,"" The Washington Post, Wednesday, August 4, 1993. Written during the ""Great Flood of 1993. 2. Emergency emotional and psychological response At the time of immediate danger and immediately afterwards, emergency emotional or psychological aid is also needed. Good crisis intervention is predicated on immediacy. Outreach addressing the emotional trauma of disasters should be performed as soon as possible. Sometimes this means that crisis responders are also exposed to danger, and crisis response teams must plan for and confront issues of safety and security for team members. Ongoing interventions may be necessary if the duration of the disaster is for an extended period.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-17  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  The length of actual impact affects the timeline of access and the method of access. The timeline of access for emotional ""rescuers""/responders may be depicted in the following two ways communities tend to respond: a. Sudden, Immediate, Short-Term, Low-Point Disasters  Impact: up to 48 hours later  Focus on survival issues  Reactions are blunted through numbing  Elation at surviving is complicated by grief, denial of the disaster, and sudden awareness of vulnerability. At this stage in the timeline of access, ideally, intervention should occur as soon as possible. Even if the trauma continues for days or weeks, initial intervention should be immediate. Early visibility of responders and interventions focused on practical needs facilitate later interventions addressing the psychological aftermath of the trauma event.  Immediate aftermath: 7-14 days  Focus is on psychological numbing with emotional flooding.  The disaster becomes integrated in present life as routine.  Denial and defenses against the impact of the disaster are erected.  Depression and fatigue set in. Access at this point may be denied if no contact was made in the impact stage of the crisis. Communities sense their ability to react to the crisis and contain it. They feel like they have done ""a good job."" In many cases, they have, yet the job often has been done at the expense of their own emotional and psychological well-being. Crisis responders are best used to support community decision-making and to provide assistance in generating community involvement and contact for individuals who feel isolated. They are also useful in helping com-  3-18   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  munities and individuals begin to plan what will happen next in their response to the aftermath of trauma.  Circle of control/exhaustion: 14 days to 6 months  Focus is on returning to routine and reestablishing community bonds.  Stress levels may be high due to fatigue and increasing secondary traumas.  Community members may reject any assistance because it serves to remind them of the original trauma. After trauma has enveloped a community for two weeks or more, the community and many individuals become exhausted and simply cannot deal with any continuing stimuli. Ideally, ongoing intervention begins and continues with group and individual crisis counseling. It is always useful to have responders available during the first six months after an event to help survivors cope with exhaustion and the sudden influx of emotion.  Access through education: 6 months onward  Focus is on education and learning about what happened and how the event will affect the long-term health and relationships of the community.  Communities begin to prepare for the future, including learning how to prevent or mitigate the impact of future tragedies. After the exhaustive activities of responding to the catastrophe, individuals and communities often begin to reassess their need for intervention. If they have rejected help in the past, it may be more acceptable to receive information and education as a part of a training program for future events. Such programs provide a safe place for individuals to learn about their reactions as well as allowing communities and individuals prepare and train for other uncommon events. This training and preparation can  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-19  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  b.       be a primary defense against future trauma when horrifying events may occur. Sudden Immediate Long Term Low Point Disasters Emergency Phase: first 3 to 4 weeks after event  Vulnerable and open about anxieties  High level of social contact  Willing to talk with anyone and tell individual stories Resistance Phase: 4 to 6 weeks  Frustration with reciprocal caregiving among support systems  Individuals want to talk about event but don't want to hear about it  Modification of routines and creation of new behaviors  Exhaustion with new demands  Return to inventory and self-assessment Conspiracy of Silence Phase: 6 to 8 weeks  Inhibitions on confronting consequences of the event  Focus on normality  Social conflict rises  Victims' physical health suffers  Stigmatization of long term psychological needs The problems of social conflict can be particularly intense and increase community vulnerability to rises in assaults, domestic violence, child abuse, and even workplace violence. A counselor's comment after Hurricane Hugo hit Florida in 1989 underscores this problem.  As long as people were dealing with survival needs  food, clothes, shelter  they didn't have a chance to focus on their emotions.... Now the emotions are surfacing. The level of frustration is very high. People are just worn out.  3-20   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes   Joyner as quoted by Leland, The Virginian-Pilot, March 21, 1990.  Adaptation Phase: 8 to 12 weeks  Coping strategies employed effectively  Consolidation of resources  Focus on meeting future challenges  Consensus building for community alliances  Repetition Phase: 12 to 24 weeks  In long-term disasters, communities may repeat the process of moving through their anxieties at each new major community milestone of reconstruction. For instance, after a major flooding, the process may proceed from the point of the flood's impact until there is stabilization in the initial relocation process. The process may begin again when community members return to their homes after the waters recede, and restart when they begin to rebuild.  Education and interventions should be available during each repetition. F. Remedy/mitigation The remedy or mitigation phase following a disaster is the period when a community or an individual attempts to regain control of life and face the shortand long-range consequences of the tragedy. It overlaps with rescue efforts when rescue has been extended over a period of time. The dangers in this phase come from those who cause ""second injuries."" 1. Disaster euphoria  the honeymoon period Initially, there may be a euphoric reaction among the survivors, accompanied by many congratulations on heroic efforts in the face of the catastrophe. The community seems to pull together and the very survival of many may be viewed as an opportunity for change and elation. On June 14, 1990, the Wegee Creek/Pipe Creek flood in  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-21  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Southeastern Ohio left 24 people dead and 60 homes demolished. Two months later, one of the survivors remarked: We lost everything we owned, but we have our lives, and it's time for a new beginning.  Michelmore, P., ""The Night the Creeks Ran Wild,"" Reader 's Digest, January, 1991. 2. Disillusionment Despite initial feelings of the joy of survival, communities and individuals are often plunged into disillusionment days or months after the event. This disillusionment may parallel individual feelings of survivor guilt or lasting stress reactions. However, some of the sources of disillusionment center around efforts to rebuild a life, to seek justice, or simply to function as a community whose primary bonds, now, are painful. Some of the sources of disillusionment arise from the construction of memorials, civil litigation, the response of the criminal justice system, media response, public policy responses, or social inequalities.  Memorials as a divisive force Almost a year after a tornado blew in the wall of an elementary school here, killing nine youngsters and injuring 17 as they ate in the cafeteria, parents are divided by an emotional dispute over how best to remember those who died.... The bereaved parents who helped design the stone  a slab of black granite etched with the victims' names and an illustration of a boy and girl ascending a light-filled staircase  say it is a joyful monument to their children. But many parents whose children survived say the memorial resembles a tomb  3-22   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  stone and would be a grim daily desperately want their children  Foderaro, L.W., ""Where Dissension Over a Memorial,"" November 2, 1990.

Twenty-one children died and 60 were injured when the bus plunged into a water-filled gravel pit.  Marcotte, P., ""Barratry Indictments,"" American Bar Association Magazine, 1989.  Criminal justice system Despite federal legislation providing victims with the right to be present at a trial and to testify through a victim impact statement at the sentencing stage, Judge Richard Matsch, who presided over the McVeigh Oklahoma City bombing case, ruled in 1996 that victims who were present during the trial would not be allowed to testify at any sentencing. Succeeding legislation has sought to clarify the victims' rights, but because the judge entertained doubts about the constitutionality of the new law, the 40 victims selected as potential ""impact witnesses"" were advised that if they attend the trial, they might be later barred from testifying. Though the court eventually allowed victims who observe the trial to testify at sentencing, the ruling only affected a handful of the impact witnesses  all the others, fearing a contrary ruling, had stayed away.

Betty Parks explained: It was ... six and one half years after Betsy died when Gary Coleman was extradited from a prison in Georgia to North Carolina and charged with her murder. For the next fourteen months he was able to delay going to trial with motion after motion  thirty-one of them at one point. These continued delays kept us off balance all of one year. I felt helpless, frustrated, and angry, wanting the trial behind us, but also wanting the preliminary steps done correctly. If Coleman had indeed murdered Betsy, I didn't want him escaping conviction through a technicality.

Public policy responses But in the second year after the bombing, the families once united by tragedy are divided by rancor.  3-24   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  What started at an organizational meeting at a restaurant on Route 17 near Paramus in February, 1989, split in two. The call for justice was touched by discord, as the former leader of the Victims of Flight 103 group became president of the breakaway Families of Pan Am 103/Lockerbie and is now voicing opposition to the bill [Proposed Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990], which the original family group still supports.  ""Lockerbie Aftermath: Split Among Families,"" The New York Times, August 12, 1990.  Social inequalities [In the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, Mr. Parrish, a community organizer said] the donated food and clothing, which keep people going until the Federal grants arrive, add a disquieting effect in isolated and insular rural areas, allowing many poor people to see just how poor they are. It has been sort of like the forbidden fruit, they have eaten from the tree of knowledge.  ""Pain Lingers for Poorer Victims of Hurricane Hugo, The New York Times, February 3, 1990.  The process of rebuilding Fire-damaged people, struggling to take care of themselves after a great loss, have in the process done even greater damage to themselves as well as to others. ""I'm entitled to get everything that's coming to me,"" the survivors of the fire typically said, and the rest of this thought, although usually left unspoken, was implicit in their deeds. ""Neighbors, planners, government officials: don't get in my way while I'm getting what's mine.""

""Remedy concerns"" for the crisis responder  Practical concerns include establishing rumorcontrol mechanisms, facilitating reliable, effective communication about disaster issues, mitigating media intrusions, assisting with funeral and memorial concerns, and providing training and education on crisis, trauma and appropriate interventions.  Group crisis intervention sessions can be a part of the remedial plan. Repetitive group crisis intervention and retrospective or reflective group crisis intervention provide useful tools for this remedial process.  Community organization activities can be a source of social reconstruction that is critical for many survivors. The crisis responder should be prepared to provide guidance to help survivors initiate such activities in a constructive way.  Planning and participating in long term trauma interventions. A devastating community disaster affects community members for years. Sometimes additional outside interventions are useful for months as well as on the first ""anniversary"" of the tragedy or when criminal justice processes continue for years. G. Adjustment The final phase in response to disaster is the period of adjustment. This phase can extend over generations.  3-26   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  1. Stage One The first stage of adjustment involves living through the first year after the event. During that time, survivors must get used to doing things they did before the disaster. Differences in physical environment and emotional or psychological responses will color everything they do. 2. Stage Two The second stage of adjustment involves the time period from the end of the first year through the next ten or fifteen years  until the beginning of the next generation of community memories. For many survivors, this will be a period of ""reliving"" and retelling the event over and over again. The transition from this period to the next will be marked when survivors realize that young people do not remember the disaster. It represents the aging of the first generation of victims and survivors. 3. Stage Three The third stage of adjustment is the time during which the catastrophe is remembered directly by fewer and fewer living survivors but the impact is evident on the next generation: there is often a yearning among both the survivors and their descendents to preserve the memories of the trauma. 4. Stage Four The fourth stage is a time when the initial catastrophe has been converted into history and legend by succeeding generations. Sometimes the stories of the disaster are changed, transformed or utilized to emphasize certain values and behaviors. At the third and fourth stages of adjustment, there may be cross-generational transfer of the traumatic experience. These stages begin with the children of the original victims and survivors and thus overlap with Stage Two but it often becomes apparent as these children reach adulthood and continue the story of the disaster through their own children.

They seem to have consciously and unconsciously absorbed their parents' Holocaust experiences into their lives almost in toto. Holocaust parents, in the attempt to give their best, taught their children how to survive and, in the process, transmitted to them the life conditions under which they had survived the war. Many children of survivors, like their parents, manifest Holocaust derived behaviors, particularly on the anniversaries of their parents' traumata. Moreover, some have internalized, as parts of their identity, the images of those who perished and hence, simultaneously live in different places (Europe and America) and different time periods (1940 and the present).  Danieli, Y., ""The Treatment and Prevention of Long-term Effects and Intergenerational Transmission of Victimization: A Lesson from Holocaust Survivors and Their Children,"" Trauma and Its Wake, Figley, C., ed., Brunner/Mazel, NY, 1985. ...There's unfinished business in the second generation, for only when you acknowledge the past can you be free. Our task is to deal with it and not forget it. Even though it is painful, we can't  we mustn't  avoid this work.  Werner Bohleber, in ""The Pathways of Pain,"" Fellman, B., Yale Alumni Magazine, March 1995.  III. Spatial Dimensions of the Crisis Experience A. Convergence The concept of convergence refers to the phenomenon of the gathering of people, information, and attention around a disaster site. People who converge usually represent groups such as ""returnees,"" those who were at the disaster but left and come back, ""absentees,"" those who weren't there at the  3-28   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  time but, in their minds, could've or should've been there, people in the general area of the disaster who are anxious and frightened by the event, the curious, exploiters, voyeurs, and the helpers. Convergence can be positive or negative. 1. Positive convergence Positive convergence occurs when people go to the scene with appropriate training and at the invitation of the community that has suffered the event. Some examples are firefighters, law enforcement officers, paramedics, disaster relief groups, and crisis responders. However, it should be noted that even when individuals or groups are well-trained, they may not be wanted or needed and can thus have a negative effect at the scene. In the response to the PSA crash in San Diego in 1978, 60 ambulances arrived when only 6 were needed.  ""Psychological Counseling is Necessary to Help Employees Cope with Plane Crashes,"" O'Connell, R., Crime Control Digest, February 15, 1988. 2. Negative convergence Negative convergence occurs when people assemble for their own purposes. They may be looters, voyeurs, ambulance-chasing attorneys, mental health professionals, media and others. Even before the debris and human remains had been cleared from the Detroit site of the USA's second-worst air crash, lawyers and insurance adjusters were descending on the victims' grieving families. Like circling vultures, lawyers swooped in to sign up clients. And the airline's insurers scrambled to head them off by offering settlements to the families of the 156 victims of Northwest Airlines Flight #255. Their ordeal is just beginning. They are the targets of a bigbucks tug of war between personal injury lawyers and  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-29  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  the airline and its insurer. The bidding began within days of the crash.  ""When Tragedy Hits, Families Need Time,"" USA Today, August 26, 1987. A man who identified himself as a Roman Catholic priest and counseled relatives of victims of the Northwest Airlines crash here last month may actually have been an imposter soliciting cases for a lawyer, officials say.  ""Priest Suspected as Imposter,"" New York Times, September 14, 1987. B. Media convergence Media convergence can have both positive and negative effects. Sensationalized coverage of traumatized or grieving survivors may add to their pain. A photo carried in both The Washington Post, December 23, 1988, and News-week accompanied the coverage of the Pan Am Flight 103 tragedy and carried the caption, ""The body of a passenger still strapped to a seat is lowered by a rescue worker from a rooftop in Lockerbie, Scotland."" The photo brought a wave of outrage from readers. On the other hand, the media can be the most effective purveyor of useful information to communities on the impact of trauma. The Gainesville Sun included an eight-page supplement on the emotional aftermath of the serial murders of five college students at the University of Florida and the Santa Fe Community College in August, 1990. C. Proximity The closer one is to the center of the disaster, the more likely one is to be at risk for post-disaster crisis and longterm stress reactions. Individuals are increasingly subject to the intensity of sensorial information when they are directly involved in the disaster area. The center of the disaster is defined as the point of impact. Eye witnesses and survivors of loved ones who died in the disaster are at high risk, in addition to victims who have suffered major injury or certain  3-30   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  types of property damage. The concentric circles shown in the figure on the next page describe these risk factors. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I lost twenty pounds in four weeks after seeing the wreck. It was so close to my house and the shock of being alive and whole seemed amazing. But at the same time I was desolate. My heart hurt for the people who died and those who were injured.  Survivor of Amtrak-Conrail train crash, NOVA Crisis Response Reports, 1987 D. Remoteness There is a human compulsion to want to be at the site of a disaster if one's loved ones or property are directly affected. The more remote the disaster from immediate access by rescuers, survivors of loved ones who are injured or dead, owners of homes destroyed, or other concerned community members, the more intense stress is experienced. If it is impossible to get to the site physically, the measure of remoteness may be affected by the availability of telephone or electronic access. For two weeks following the storm, no outside organization  not the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army or even the media  realized that this isolated community had been virtually destroyed. ""Most of the residents left Copahee just before the hurricane hit, and when they returned, they were too stunned to do anything. The town looked like a war zone. Houses were reduced to splinters. Trailers were destroyed. People were sifting through the rubble, trying to find any personal belonging  a family picture, a child's toy. It was a shocking, horrible sight.""

Geographic spread The greater the area affected by the disaster, the more chance that it will become a community-wide tragedy. People identify with certain geographical areas as well as geographical symbols. If those are affected, they extend the range of community members who feel touched by the catastrophe. Other storms piled up more snow, recorded higher winds, killed more people. But for combined extent and intensity, the Blizzard of '93, as it was called in most of the U.S., was in a class by itself. Tornadoes in Florida, record cold in Alabama (2 degrees F. in Birmingham), mountainous snows from North Carolina (50 in. at Mount Mitchell) to New York (43 in. at Syracuse), hurricane-force winds (110 m.p.h. in Franklin County, Florida)  all were part of the same monster storm system that from March 12 to March 15 spread death and destruction from Cuba, where three died, to the Canadian Maritimes (four killed). Deaths totaled 238, and that did not include 48 sailors missing from vessels that sank off Nova Scotia and in the Gulf of Mexico. Worst tolls: 50 in Pennsylvania, and 44 in Florida, where winds made deadly projectiles out of rubble still lying on the ground from Hurricane Andrew in August. Helicopters and search parties on snowshoes were still looking for hikers and campers stranded in Southern U.S. Mountains; nine were airlifted out of Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park as late as Thursday. Economic damages seemed sure to climb well past an early guess of $800 million; in New York State, Governor Mario Cuomo estimated snow-removal costs alone at $120 million. If it was not ""the storm of the century,"" survivors hope they never see the real one.

Role Dimensions A. How does one identify or define a victim? 1. A role classification system One suggestion comes from Disasters and Disaster Stress, AMS Press, New York, 1989, in a classification scheme developed by A.J.W. Taylor and A.G. Frazier. It follows: a. Primary Victims  those who are directly exposed to a large scale catastrophe with the potential for destroying life, disrupting well established relationships and patterns of behavior, and for destroying property; b. Secondary Victims  those with close family and personal ties to the primary victims who themselves have severe grief and, perhaps, guilt reactions; c. Tertiary Victims  those whose occupations and duties require them to respond to any major alert in the community and to assist with any subsequent rehabilitation and restoration work; d. Quarternary Victims  those concerned and caring members of communities beyond the impact area who express their intentions, often with inappropriate goods and services. They might also come from organizations that feel some responsibility for having perhaps contributed to the cause of a particular disaster; e. Quinternary Victims  those individuals and groups who lose control when in proximity to disasters and either reveal their underlying psychopathology by their ghoulish preoccupation with cadavers or by their unruly behavior in mobs; f. Sesternary Victims  miscellaneous people who (i) think that, but for chance events, they would have been primary or secondary victims;  3-34   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  (ii) refrained from expressing a premonition to somebody who subsequently became a primary victim; (iii) actively induced people to enter situations in which they became primary victims; (iv) were the close relatives and friends of the tertiary victims who waited at home for news that their people were safe and then shared the emotional burden of the post-disaster working situation; (v) as clinicians and researchers, at a stage often far removed from the disaster-face, are liable to have their professional competence affected because of 1. the acute and prolonged demands presented by their own post-disaster work, 2. the risk of emotional identification with the suffering of some workers, 3. any compelling desire to appear to be doing something immediately ""useful"" as distinct from the indirect or abstract, 4. any thirst from seeking sustained dramatic experience; (vi) suffer guilt from benefiting from a disaster. 2. An individual's subjective perception of role While the definitions above are based on observation, an individual's subjective experience may record the tragedy from several different perspectives. That subjective experience may involve complex roles:  The victim who is injured or who has lost property in the event.  The sensorial witness, either as a bystander or a responder.  The survivor of a loved one involved in the catastrophe  a loved one who has died, been injured, or had property destroyed.  The rescuer who has helped others, sometimes as an on-scene responder or as a remote responder who has a job supporting on-scene responders.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-35  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes   A community member who has witnessed or survived a disaster which has threatened the community's existence. 3. Often rescuers have cognitively dissonant reactions to their roles.  Some were perceived by others as heroes when they were not. Joshua Conyers, age 14, died in the Carrolltown bus crash. He was attributed with saving his younger brother Aaron, but other evidence suggests that those initial stories were untrue.  Crisis Response Report, NOVA, June, 1988.  Some are perceived as heroes, yet they, themselves feel they failed. Robert Booker [later celebrated as a hero] will never forget his descent into the smoky darkness of a crumpled Amtrak car where passengers lay injured and dying. He was the first one into the car  the first to try to douse flames and save a man whose legs and head he could partially see sticking through the choking smoke and wreckage. ""There was a guy stuck. He was yelling, `Help me,' ... The man's legs and hair were in flames and he was coughing with smoke. I took off my shirt and put it over his face. He died right there. ... I won't forget the fact that I couldn't get that one man out. His face will stay with me forever.""  The Baltimore Sun, January 6, 1987.  Other people, while successful in helping during the event, feel uncomfortable with being given ""hero"" status.  3-36   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Ever since Capt.

List of population attributes In Appendix A to this chapter is a list of some attributes of certain populations in disaster. It is not meant to be exhaustive but simply to serve as a stimulus to crisis responders to think of special concerns of population groups.  V. Assessment of Social Disruption A final consideration in examining the dimensions of a trauma event is the assessment of social disruption. The experience of trauma is rooted in the sensorial impacts, the perception of threat, the emotional and physical reactions to that threat, and the attempt to cognitively understand what is happening. It is also rooted in the trauma victim's formation of the disaster's chronology and the need to put the traumatic events into an organized narrative. But merely understanding the story of what happened leaves it unresolved. A final step to integrating the plot of this particular story with the narrative of one's life is to find a way to interpret its meaning and value in one's belief system. That system is tied to cultural and social values and to community relationships. The extent of social disruption may help indicate how difficult or dissonant the integration process will be. The following are some considerations for understanding the social disruption after a community wide catastrophe. A. Practical indicators 1. Disruption of transportation and communication systems that interrupt the ability to reestablish social contacts.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-37  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  2. Disruption of the community economic system. This includes lost and interrupted jobs; destruction of the economic base of a community such as agriculture, tourism, or a major corporate structure; or lost tax revenues. 3. Alterations in spatial arrangements of neighborhoods and businesses that disrupt behavioral routines and mobility. B. Emotional indicators 1. Reduction in community wide participation at social and religious routines and events. 2. The loss through death or injury of key community or family leaders in addition to other community members. 3. The exacerbation of cultural tensions. 4. The incapacitation of the caregiving community. 5. The destruction of community symbols or rituals. 6. The lack of community history and traditions on which to rely in the face of disaster. 7. Intermittent and inconsistent assistance provided by external formal aid structures. 8. Preexisting cultural and social values that demean or isolate victims or survivors who openly manifest trauma symptoms or acknowledge the disaster as traumatizing.  VI. Possible Disaster Impacts A. A classification system [See ""Disaster Typology"" in Appendix B, which is adapted from a table prepared by A.J.W. Taylor in Disasters and Disaster Stress, AMS Press, New York, 1989, p. 12] Causes of disaster are defined as ""natural,"" relating to disasters that have been caused by profound disruptions of the physical environment, ""industrial,"" relating to disasters arising from a serious disruption of the ecosystem from the products, by-products, and waste from the manufacturing system, and ""human,"" relating to disasters arising from errors of judgment, deliberate action, or incompetence.  3-38   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  B. Prominent issues relating to different causes of disaster 1. Natural disasters a. Often cause heavy casualties and severe damage to property. b. Mythological explanations, omens, and symbols often are used to understand what happened. c. Catastrophes may raise issues of faith or sin. d. Survivors often have a greater acceptance of the consequences of ""Acts of God"" or ""Mother Nature"" than they do of consequences of human-caused disasters. e. Many natural disasters have a clearer period of warning prior to impact. f. Since personal blame is not a primary issue, there may be a greater outpouring of altruism and compassion in efforts to help survivors. Looking back in history, a description of an earthquake and its consequent explanations is useful. On November 1, 1755 a major earthquake occurred in Portugal that killed over 60,000 people. Following the earthquake were tidal waves and fires. The event was interpreted as a demonstration of God's anger at an evil population and many writings on the philosophies of God's revenge and the duty of making peace with God were explored.  Kendrick, T.D. The Lisbon Earthquake. New York, NY. Lippincott, 1955, 2. Industrial or technological disasters a. Political issues may have affected the installation or operation of a plant or industrial site and may be seen as the cause of the tragedy. b. Economic issues related to the reasons for the operation of the installation or the potential for community revival may compound the explanations.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-39  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  c. There is a lack of personal accountability for the event and institutional depersonalization of the victims. d. ""Loss of faith in experts"" may increase stress levels as well as resentments and dissensions in communities. e. In many technological disasters, the fear of illness, cancer, or other diseases may increase even when there is no evidence of probable correlation with the event. f. First responders and crisis responders may be reluctant to provide services because of their personal fear of contamination. g. Many such catastrophes have long-term impact and no perceivable low point. In technological disasters...the duration of the initial crisis period may be prolonged. For example, the accident at TMI[Three Mile Island] unfolded over several days, not several hours. Furthermore, the original leakage triggered a series of concomitant events, including the disruptions caused by evacuation, fears associated with the hydrogen bubble, continued uncertainty about how and when the decontamination process would be carried out, subsequent revelations that the accident came within 30 to 60 minutes of a meltdown, the venting of krypton gas the following spring, and the uncertainty of whether the undamaged reactor would be started up again. Thus, crisis intervention models usually employed in acute crisis situations may not be entirely appropriate.  Bromet, Evelyn, J., ""The Nature and Effects of Technological Failures,"" Psychosocial Aspects of Disaster, eds. Gist, Richard & Lubin, Bernard, New York: Wiley & Sons, 1989 3. Human disasters a. Issues of justice/fairness are critical when human beings cause disasters. In the United  3-40   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  b.  c.  d. e.  f.  States either or both the civil and criminal justice systems may become involved in investigations and court processes. Most tragedies caused by humans are seen as preventable, yet in a social context, little has been done to concentrate on prevention strategies rather than intervention strategies after tragedy occurs. If the disaster is caused by purposeful human cruelty, there may be issues related to evil or the impossibility of understanding the criminal mind. If the disaster is related to social conflict such as riots or wars, there may be demonization of different cultural groups in a society. When humans cause accidents, there are often issues related to the preventability of the disaster. Accidents often cause more intense anger in survivors than do crime-related crises. Human caused disasters may significantly affect the abilities of individuals to trust each other and thus exaccerbate the deterioration of social bonds. This is particularly true when violence is committed by family members or friends.  The damage to the survivor's faith and sense of community is particularly severe when the traumatic events themselves involve the betrayal of important relationships. The imagery of these events often crystallizes around a moment of betrayal, and it is this breach of trust which gives the intrusive images their intense emotional power.  Herman, J., Trauma and Recovery C. Prominent issues illustrating different elements of disaster 1. Earth a. The earth is assumed to be firm and safe. In some cultures, the earth is the source of life.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-41  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Earth disasters threaten the myth of ""terra firma"". b. Earth disasters often involve events that imprison or enclose victims against their will. c. Most earth disasters are sudden and often happen without warning even in geographical areas that may expect a disaster. 2. Air a. The air is perceived as erratic and less under the control of human beings. Since God or nature seems to have control, resulting disasters may be more readily integrated into individual and community understandings. b. Due to the unpredictability of the wind, the air and space, the randomness of community or individual impact often heightens terror during impact and confusion at inventory. c. Explanations of wind events may take the form of trying to understand the ""winds of change"". 3. Fire a. Fire is both terrifying and exciting to most people. Fire was a ""gift from the gods"" that allowed humans to expand their understanding of the world in old mythologies. There is still a sense of excitment over fires -- even disasterous ones. This creates a cognitive dissonance for many after a major disaster. b. Fire evokes concepts of hell and damnation for some cultures. It is particularly true among many cultures in the United States. Hence, death by fire poses many conceptual problems for those who confront it. c. On a practical level, fire often consumes or distorts the bodies of people who are its victims and surviving family and friends may have difficultly dealing with these consequences, 4. Water a. Disasters caused by water are varied. The consequences are also varied. A flood may destroy miles of property, homes and lives. The drowning of an individual or a community  3-42   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  when a ship sinks also involves the element of water. In either case, the catastrophe changes the landscape or seascape of life. In the JudeoChristian traditions, water disasters are often equated with the great flood depicted in the Bible. b. Natural floods may be equated with natural forces such as those that are found in wind disasters. Floods caused by manmade structures may be more difficult to deal with by survivors. Accidents on the waters are often viewed with horror due to a pervasive thinking that water is inherently unsafe. c. On a practical level, water, like fire, may destroy or distort the bodies of those who die. 5. People a. People victimized by other people are often the most angry. There is a difference between the anger manifested against a person who is perceived as mentally ill and a person who is simply negligent. The anger is usually greater toward to the latter. This accountability that individuals and communities impose upon other individuals or communities is especially agonizing since it often contributes to further social distress. b. The particular dynamic that disasters based on human elements may include is the tension caused by cruelty and brutality executed by an offender. The idea that an individual or consortium of individuals is unfeeling or unrepentant for the damage that they caused is reprehensible to most. c. When victims are subjected to specific acts of torture, mutilation, hate or degradation, the outrage of other individuals and communities in response may be especially high. D. Differences between types of disaster threats based on conceptual, sensorial, and duration issues. The following is a list of different kinds of disas-  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-43  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  ters and the issues they raise. These are not exhaustive but may help crisis responders to identify critical experiences and concerns of survivors in the aftermath of each disaster type. Similar experiences and concerns arise in many different disaster types, yet some are disaster-specific. For instance, in water disasters such as floods, death caused by drowning results in bloated bodies, while in fire disasters, dead bodies may be charred beyond recognition. 1. Earth disasters: avalanches, volcanos, landslides, and earthquakes a. Useful recent examples.  Mt. St. Helens volcano, 1980 - 68 persons dead  The Armenian earthquake, 1988  Loma Prieta earthquake, 1989 - 55 dead  Banff, Alberta, Canada avalanche, March 5, 1991 - 10 dead  Northridge earthquake, 1994 - 24 persons dead  Great Hanshin earthquake (Kobe, Japan) 1995 - over 5,000 dead b. The impact when the earth moves  Volcano The eruption of Mt. Pelee on Martinque in 1902 wiped out a city of 30,000 in a matter of minutes. The destructive effect of the avalanche of white-hot particles mixed with gas and superheated steam traveling at hurricane speed was such that most people died instantly wherever they happened to be, for the temperature was estimated to have been 1000 degrees Centigrade. Only two men of the town of 30,000 survived: a shoemaker who survived by some accident, and a prisoner due to be hanged for murder who was protected by the bizarre condemned cell in which he was kept. Rescued after three days, he described his experience: ""I smelled nothing but my own body burning. ... Soon I heard nothing but my own unanswered cries for help.""  3-44   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes   Raphael, B., When Disaster Strikes: How Individuals and Communities Cope with Catastrophe.

""A noise, a terrible swaying, and then there was no one."" ... the Armenian earthquake  which struck December 7, killing at least 55,000 people and ruining much larger cities  was unforgiving and surgically quick in Spitak. Everyone in Spitak describes the same feeling, a tremendous shock ""like a bomb,"" the eerie feel of rocking, and then collapse. Remock, D. ""In Spitak, `We have No More Tears Left',"" The Washington Post, December 15, 1988. Decades of assumptions were shattered by those 20 seconds of the Great Hanshin Earthquake. The people of postwar Japan had put their trust in an elaborate ""earthquake-proofing"" plan that they were convinced would avert disaster. ... Indeed, Japanese building codes are among the strictest in the world. A national network of 200 seismic monitors measures and pinpoints every quake of noticeable magnitude and, among other emergency responses, sends out computerized instructions to shut down the bullet trains and keep them from derailing at speeds up to 170 m.p.h. Everyone takes part in drills at home and at work. Even the smallest child in nursery school knows what to do when the shaking starts: put on your helmet and crawl under the desk. Twenty seconds was all it took to leave that faith in tatters and undermine all the certainties and resolve that stemmed from it. Elliott, L. ""Earthquake at Dawn,""Readers Digest, November, 1995.

Earth: dam failures a. Useful examples  The Johnstown dam disaster, 1889  The Buffalo Creek dam disaster, 1972 b. Impact of resulting floods The dam gave way at 3:10 pm. The water first slashed a ten foot-wide notch in the top of the dam. Then the entire middle section caved in. The torrent spilled into the bed of the South Fork and climbed its sides, tearing trees out by the roots, and creating a cloud of dust and debris that whirled ahead of the flood. The wave smashed down the Little Conemaugh valley, churning up everything in its path. At one point, where the valley narrowed, the water reached a height of 89 feet (measured later by the flood lines); the consensus among witnesses to its awesome rush was that the wave was generally 30-40 feet high. The watchers at the dam stared dumbstruck as the entire two-mile long lake  3-48   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  emptied in 45 minutes. Roaring frightfully and rolling over itself, surf-like, the great wave plunged at a speed estimated variously at 20 to 40 miles an hour, billowing out and then hourglassing in where the valley does. ... [one survivor said] ""It looked like an ocean with waves and surf, but it was the roar I remember best  a rolling sound like thunder, but not like anything I've heard since. I think it took about an hour and a half for it to pass."" The whirling wall of water encountered its first major obstacle at the recently built stone railroad bridge. ... Timbers, houses, railroad cars, makeshift rafts and machinery crashed to a stop there, temporarily blocking the path of the flood. ... Floating houses and parts of houses, many loaded with people, smacked one after another into the debris at the bridge. ... Sometime around nightfall the debris at the bridge caught fire. Hundreds of people trapped in the wreckage, some with their arms or legs pinned, now faced the hideous prospect of waiting to burn to death.

The primitive and overwhelming sounds of the wind, the force of the winds and the rain, and destruction of what had seemed to be solid structures were indeed frightening. It was estimated that gusts of winds exceeded 250 KM/hour. ""As the full fury of Tracy struck, windows broke, houses were deroofed and finally disintegrated as families were left in the rubble of their own homes in the pitch black, the pelting rain and the shrieking gale,... Children were wrenched away from the arms of their parents, the possessions of a lifetime were blown away."" There was then, ""after four hours of this terrifying ordeal, a deadly hush,"" as Darwin stood in the eye of the cyclone. Then after a period of eerie calm, the winds returned from the opposite direction with renewed force, bringing further death and devastation, until the final period of calm several hours later. 65 people had died, 140 seriously injured, most of the population of 45,000 left homeless.  3-50   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes   Raphael, B., When Disaster Strikes, 1986. c.

It was a moment of considerable potential danger, as we all were soon to learn. It was a moment of considerable uncertainty as well. At the height of the uncertainty, Pennsylvania's governor, Richard Thornburgh, issued a calm and measured advisory suggesting that pregnant women and preschool children living within five miles of the plant might want to evacuate and that all other people within ten miles ought to consider taking shelter in their homes. In effect, the governor was recommending that 3,500 persons living in the shadow of the reactor relocate for at least the time being and that everyone else stay put. Instead, some 200,000 persons were alarmed enough to take to the public highways, and they fled, on average, a remarkable 100 miles. For every person advised to leave home, almost 60 did.

Impact of crashes and explosions At 3:15 p.m. one year ago, the chicken-finger snack was being served on United Flight 232, 37,000 feet above northeast Iowa, when the tail engine exploded. The plane rocked, banked to the right and began to fall. Shrapnel from the engine had sliced through the jet's control lines. Precious hydraulic fluid drained away in two minutes, leaving the crew with no control over the plane's steering system. But by varying the thrust to the jet's two remaining engines, Capt. Al C. Haynes and his crew were able to keep the plane flying the 70 miles to the Sioux City's Gateway Airport. The crash came with the warning ""Brace, brace, brace."" Joseph Trombello, a Chicago auditor, clutched the seat in front of him as the other passengers tucked heads into laps, grabbed ankles and held children on the floor.

Impact of explosions The flames shoot up to 150 feet high and burn at temperatures near 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt steel. They produce a roar like a jet engine and can be so brilliant that you have to squint at them up close. If you're smart about it, which is to say if you're experienced, you carry a 10-foot-tall corrugated tin heat shield, wear flame-retardant cotton long johns beneath coveralls, keep your pockets empty and leave as little skin exposed as possible. Otherwise, your face and arms begin to burn about 40 yards from the flame and the keys in your pocket get so hot that they print little red welts on your thigh. About 20 yards from the wellhead, where the desert sand is so hot that it shimmers and turns to glass, the rubber soles of your shoes get gummy and start to melt. The firefighters who get that close tend to step lively, but even that's not a sure bet.

Impact of fire [Jose] Aponte climbed through the shards, severely cutting his arm as he did so, and stood on the small ledge just outside the window. He perched there, still hoping that he would not have to jump the 20 feet to the concrete below. But at that moment, he heard a howling sound, like that of a jet engine at close range, and looked back into the casino. Every detail of that scene is seared forever in his photographic memory. A huge fireball was blazing through the room toward him. There were screams and crashing glass, and everything the ball of fire hit was completely consumed. He saw a friend and casino employee, Santiago Torres, scooping up money, or chips, and when the ball of fire hit him, the flesh of his face shrank tight against his bones, and then he burst into flames... Then just as the room seemed to explode, Aponte shoved himself backward, shredding his hands on the glass, and fell toward the concrete below. He landed on top of another person, easing his fall, but broke an ankle. Somehow Aponte was able to drag himself away from the orange flames stabbing out of the casino windows. ""When I looked up, I knew everybody was dead,"" Jose Aponte says. ""You could tell because there wasn't a human sound.

Impact of disease Wherever the plague appeared, the suddenness of death was terrifying. Today, even with hand-me-down memories of the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and the advent of AIDS, it is hard to grasp the strain that the plague put on the physical and spiritual fabric of society. People went to bed perfectly healthy and were found dead in the morning. Priests and doctors who came to minister to the sick, so the wild stories ran, would contract the plague with a single touch and die sooner than the person they had come to help. In his preface to The Decameron, a collection of stories told while the plague was raging, Boccacio reports that he saw two pigs rooting around in the clothes of a man who had just died, and after a few minutes of snuffling, the pigs began to run wildly around and around, then fell dead.

Impact of crime Daylight Savings Time had extended the afternoon light, so there was plenty of time left after church and lunch with a friend for my mother to work in the garden. It was a quiet Sunday in Princeton, N.J., last April 2, and showers had softened the ground for planting. It was not a time for murder... But that Sunday my worst nightmare came true. Someone jumped out of the shadows and stabbed my mother five times in the back. No one is sure why. The killer stole nothing, and quietly locked the door when leaving. My mother 's body wasn't discovered until two days later. The irony of my mother 's death is that she was the type of citizen who is our first line of defense in what has become the third largest crime wave in our nation's history. She was actively involved in her community. She knew who her neighbors were and she watched out for them. ...Princeton lost its immunity that day, becoming one less town that can say, ""It can't happen here.""

In such cases, these scars hold the evidence of suffering linked to barbarity, the statement of physical martyrdom, but also of a never-healing wound, one so deep that it can interfere in every instant of one's life. It is necessary to be able to unveil that which is behind what is ""palpable"" in the suffering endured, what is buried behind these marks. It is necessary to take the time to listen, to wait for confidence to become real and strong.

There is no way to measure the impact on a child who sees her family killed or to quantify the emotional and psychological toll on children who live for years in fear of bombings, mutilation or death.

The issues listed above involve, first, the causes of disaster  natural, industrial, technological, or human  and second the elements of the disaster   The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-71  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  earth, air, fire, water, or human. These two factors help to describe the dominant forces of concern in a specific disaster. However, most disasters also involve secondary forces. For instance, an airplane crash may also involve explosions and fires on the ground; a hurricane may be accompanied by flooding and may also result in human violence in the aftermath; a technological disaster may result in fires, disease, and illness over time. Therefore, it is important as crisis responders go to a disaster that they attempt to identify some of the critical issues that will occur to the community in the immediate aftermath as well as in the long range. This involves identifying both dominant and secondary forces in any disaster situation. 2. The outlining process. a. Determine whether the disaster is caused primarily by nature, industry or technology or a human source. b. Identify the dominant element involved. c. List the issues relating to the dominant source and element. d. Determine the secondary sources in the disaster. e. Identify the secondary elements. f.

Believability What was incapable of happening never happened, and what was capable of happening is not a miracle...Consequently there are no miracles  Cicero Many victims and survivors measure their reactions against a continuum of what is believable about the disaster and what is unbelievable. If the event is considered to be impossible, then survivors may feel more anger and less fear. They are angry about the fact that something happened that could never have happened, but they generally have little fear because they do not believe it will happen again. If an event is considered improbable  believable but not expectable  then fear of the unsafety of the world is increased, although fear of a repetition may be reduced. The more possible the event is, the less the shock of sudden, unexpected danger. However, even with the possible there is often anger because people think the possible should have been impossible if protective devices could have been employed. The more probable a disaster is, the less anger will be felt. Many who knew they were at risk may adjust their pre-disaster concerns to accommodate the possibility of disaster and use that adjustment to reconcile their world view in the aftermath of the disaster.  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-73  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  There are predictable events that are perceived as disasters. These differ from possible or probable disasters since there is time for warning and a chance for choice. If adequate warning is given, there will be less likelihood of anger or fear in the aftermath, although if individuals do not respond to the warning, there may be guilt. If adequate warning is not given, there will be exacerbated anger or fear.  VIII. Distinguishing Features of Community Tragedy A. The extent of death and mayhem 1. In most cases, the greater the number of dead or injured and the greater the amount of carnage, the more likely that the tragedy will be perceived as affecting a broad community. 2. In some cases, the extent of death and mayhem will not be as relevant as who is killed or injured. Children attract extra concern and attention. If a person who has a special degree of public importance or a special position in the community is killed, it may affect the community at large. When President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. were assassinated, millions in the nation were united in shock and mourning. B. Massive dislocation and relocation. 1. Home, school and workplace usually are invested with a sense of extended personal identity. The longer one has worked or lived in a particular place, the more it is seen as an extension of self. Fracturing that identity can be as damaging emotionally as physical injury. 2. If the dislocation or relocation involves establishing a temporary home in a shelter or other facility, the strange surroundings may cause increased anxiety and a sense of loss. 3. The strangeness of new environments will be more strongly felt if pre-disaster social networks are not able to be maintained.  3-74   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  C. Unemployment, job loss, or severe individual financial losses. Disasters that are accompanied by long-term unemployment or financial losses can threaten the survival of individuals, families and communities. Since employment is an important part of many people's sense of social support, wide-scale layoffs or company reorganizations can cause community-wide crisis. Many of the Ramada Inn employees were left destitute in the aftermath of the Air Force plane crash in Indianapolis. Since they were in the hotel/restaurant business, many received minimum wage and counted on tips to make a financial difference. They did not pay large amounts into unemployment insurance and were unable to collect enough to meet post-disaster bills. Some faced eviction and the inability to feed their families. They also experienced feelings of a fractured community because they were a very close-knit employment community that would, in all likelihood, never work together again.  Crisis Response Report, NOVA, November, 1987. D. Extent and kind of property destruction 1. Wide-scale property destruction may demolish the physical structure of a community and thus change the landscape, transportation routes, and normal routines. Maj. Gen. Robert Moorehead, Commander of the Virgin Islands National Guard, said of the scene on the morning after the storm, ""In all my military experience, I had never seen anything like it. It appeared to me that we had been the victims of a nuclear blast."" Not only was Christiansted strewn with uprooted trees, broken utility poles, shattered cars and tons of debris from buildings that looked bombed, but the verdant tropical island suddenly had turned brown.

This desolate, end-of-the-world landscape and sense of isolation contributed to the disorder that followed.

Landmarks in the community, memorials, or community meeting places may also hold special emotional value to community members. If they are destroyed, it may be the final blow that rips the community apart. E. Number of people affected The more individuals involved as victims, survivors, helpers, bystanders, and the like, the greater the community impact. It is almost impossible to comprehend the numbers involved in a massive disaster such as the Great Hanshin earthquake or the Oklahoma City bombing. ... the physical extent of the damage caused by thebomb was much greater than would be inferred from the focused publicity on the Murrah building. In fact, glass was broken in buildings two miles distant from the explosion; and the sound and accompanying shock wave were sensed simultaneously by almost half a million people. ... Amongst the victims, 759 persons were injured, 167 [sic] fatally. Eighty-eight percent of the occupants of the Murrah building were injured; and 19 children were killed. Utilizing a case definition of injury that required medical treatment in order to qualify, 101 of the rescuers sustained injury, including one death. ...

Sensationalism and voyeurism Intrusions by media representatives or onlookers who are simply there to see the rubble, or carnage, or grief of the community enhance the feelings of abandonment and anger of survivors. While people will turn to other community members for support, there will be a great deal of resentment towards uninvited outsiders who have no positive assistance to offer. From time to time throughout the search, scenes of emotion and sometimes ugly confrontation have been played out in and around the collapse. Yesterday, members of two families awaiting word on the fate of loved ones cried softly as they stood at the edge of the rubble near an American flag fluttering on a pole. Outside Kolbe Cathedral High School nearby, another grieving family was approached by a photographer. ""Get that woman away from me,"" one member of the family screamed, breaking into sobs. ... a rescue worker asked for comment by a reporter turned suddenly, his face flushed with anger.

Depth of involvement of the community: relative loss and deprivation If this has not been the worst thing that has happened to the community, the impact of the latest disaster may not be perceived with the same intensity that an outside observer may have projected. However, if this is seen as the worst thing that has happened or this represents an accumulation of disasters, it may be perceived as a representation of the ""end of the world,"" or the recognition of an ultimate confrontation with evil.  3-78   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Clay Foreman describes this perception in the aftermath of an accident in which a freestanding tower crane at a San Francisco building site collapsed and killed four construction workers and a school bus driver, and injured twentytwo others on November 19, 1989. This was two months after the Loma Prieta Earthquake. In the following conversation, the worker's family was in a shelter. Eght hours before, he had witnessed another worker drive a truck off the top of the construction site and crash 100 feet below. Foreman recounts the dialogue between a counselor (C) and the construction worker (W) ""who seemed to believe the end of the world was at hand."" C.

The ""star"" effect: compounding stress within and across social circles [see chart, next page] The chart illustrates how the individual crisis reaction is multiplied horizontally across the community. While an individual tragedy may affect the individual and his loved ones, the effect of a community trauma is that each individual and his loved ones are affected, but they, in turn, react to and affect others who are also suffering from the same trauma. The direct victim becomes one of many co-victims. Multiple reactions occur in different forms and at different times. ""The ... the ... your mother 's plane ... it crashed, Shep.

For the first time I thought what exquisite anguish he must be living.

The ""pinball"" effect, whereby stresses bounce well beyond the immediate place of crisis into history [see chart, next page] The chart illustrates how the crisis effects change over time. The individual crisis reaction may subside more quickly than a community reaction. For the community in trauma, there is a reinforcement of the crisis even when it is a reinforcement of disillusionment. Estrangement, isolation and anger may cause irreparable rifts between the support systems and may cause total community reformation. It may also reshape history, values, and attitudes in ways which reinterpret the present as well as the past. Michael Holquist, a comparative literature professor who chairs Yale's Council on Russian and East European Studies, recently watched two videotapes that focused on Bosnia. One highlighted Bosnian Serbs involved in ""ethnic cleansing,"" the other was devoted to some of their victims, Bosnian Muslims who have resettled in New Haven and whose testimonies are compiled into an archive similar to that for Holocaust survivors. ""Accounts of trauma are never pretty, but some stories are more horrifying than others,"" says Holquist. ""These were particularly grisly."" The Serbian soldiers, noted the scholar, kept bringing up Kosovo, the site of numerous battles more than 500 years ago, each of which was mentioned to fan the flames of nationalism. ""There's a timeless world of Serbian glory that's caught up in the Kosovo epic,"" says Holquist. ""The way it is constantly being invoked to justify the unthinkable demonstrates the way a subject in the present negotiates the past.""  3-82   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  The Direct and ""Pinball"" Effects of Trauma  ""Pinball"" effects Victim Family Friends Colleagues, social institutions Contemporary society Traumatic event Direct effects  Future generations  The Trauma Response: External Factors   3-83  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Fellman, B.

Multiple histories In a community situation, each individual brings to the crisis his or her own history. In addition, each may bring a history of a former community crisis. And finally, the community brings its own history. The community and subcommunities all have their own personalities and histories. They, in turn, compound the history of the individual. It is not unusual for such other traumas to surface during group and individual crisis intervention efforts. Dryden High School students came to class Monday morning after a weekend speculation about the whereabouts of two teens. By mid-morning, they had learned that their worst fears were true. ... evidence had been recovered to suggest the girls were dead. ...

It is also not uncommon for a series of trauma histories to collate in the minds of a community to produce community-wide crisis and sometimes a drive for change.  3-84   The Trauma Response: External Factors  1987, 1994, 1998 by the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Washington, D.C.   Community Crisis Response Team Training Manual: Second Edition  Participant's Notes  Although it was the death of 15-year-old Kylie Smith that became the catalyst for a massive petition, hers wasn't the only death that has outraged New Zealanders. We have been sickened by murders such as the killing of 6-year-old Theresa Cormack in Napier, Kirsa Jensen also of Napier, taken from her house in broad daylight with her body still remaining unrecovered. The schoolgirl Karla Cardano, abducted and murdered after visiting a dairy in the Lower Hutt suburb of Taita; Louisa Damadran, a little girl killed and thrown into a river in Christchurch. Another small child, Sarah Currie of Invercargill, who was sexually molested and murdered in the inner sanctuary of her own home. These are but a handful of the dreadful crimes that spring to mind in New Zealand, a country we are so proud of. Disgraceful as all of these crimes are, it seems that the outrage on Kylie Smith was what tipped the balance. O'Brien, B., Shattered Dreams, Birkenhead, Auckland, David Ling Publishing, Ltd., 1996. K. Immobilization of helpers Caregivers are often immobilized by the same shock, disbelief and denial that afflicts direct victims or survivors. Hence, their helping mechanisms and techniques may not be implemented as quickly or efficiently. L. Politics and the chaos of disaster organizations Perhaps one of the most problematic issues in the immediate aftermath of catastrophe is community politics. The question of ""who is in charge"" is compounded by the fact that normal responding agencies may be in chaos, but also may be reluctant to let anyone else seize the credit. Leadership may become fragmented and the normal bonding for survival may be interfered with as survivors worry about who gets the credit for rescue operations or other actions.

Offers of help came pouring in from 76 nations and districts, as well as from the United Nations and the World Health Organization. Incredibly, the Japanese government either turned them down or delayed aid with time-squandering bureaucratic procedures. As people lay dying undiscovered in the wreckage, officials spent one whole day debating a Swiss offer to fly in 20 trained sniffer dogs  and then accepted only 12. A French team of trauma specialists, also belatedly admitted, were not allowed to work at all because they lacked certain Japanese medical qualifications.  Elliott, Lawrence, ""Earthquake at Dawn,"" Reader's Digest, November, 1995. It was apparent that there was absolutely no coordination among the twenty-two or so agencies who were involved in the aftermath of this disaster. There was a kind of confusion as to where responsibilities lay and it was also apparent that various territorial battles were being fought on the back of a terrible tragedy.

Conclusion In examining the nature of catastrophe one is struck by the fact that tragedies happen and that survival depends upon our ability to reconnect with a community. That community may be one that existed prior to the disaster or it may be created by the disaster itself.

Technical assistance and training helps to improve the interaction and decision-making processes between elected council members and appointed administrators.  This assistance strengthens indigenous training programs for local officials, managers, and staff so as to introduce higher standards of transparency and accountability in local governance.  Advisors, exchanges, publications, and support to local municipal associations and think tanks promote greater understanding and support for decentralization among national and local policymakers and foster greater dialogue between the capitol and the regions.     Program Categories  include support for local government management capacity.      Key Results : Three key results are required to achieve this objective: 1) the introduction of democratic practices in targeted local governments; 2) increased local government capacity; and 3) increased local government authority.      Performance and Prospects : There was considerable receptivity at the local level to USAID's previous local government strategy.  Until just recently, there was little indication that the national government is willing to make systematic changes towards decentralization and local government reform.  In January 2001 the president announced that elections for the mayors of village and self-government cities will take place in October 2001.  Current indications are that the elections will be a controlled affair, but there is some hope that international and domestic opinion, as expressed by parliament and civic groups, will strengthen the process.     Thus far, the modest authorities that have been given to self-governing cities by law have not been implemented in all localities because of resistance from the administrative level over it.  Local governments continue to exert no effective control over local taxes and fees.  The central authorities predetermine 80% to 90% of USAID's pilot cities' budgets.  Much remains to be done in the areas of budgeting, revenue raising and revenue sharing involving the Ministry of Finance.  Budgeting and financial management assistance is coordinated with the mission's fiscal reform strategic objective.  Assistance with asset management has led to collaboration with the USAID land registration effort.     Notwithstanding government inaction, there were a number of positive events over the past year. A growing number of public hearings were held. Local Economic Development Boards were launched with participation of NGOs and businesspeople in the pilot cities of Uzgen, Kant, Tokmok, and Naryn. Improved management practices in the area of financial and communal property management have been adopted by the four pilot cities and are ready for dissemination to other self-government cities. Condominium promotion was again one of the most successful activities, leading to an increase in the number of condominiums from 132 to 222 during this reporting period. Despite the resistance to condominium formation by the Bishkek city maintenance agency, eight condominiums were formed in the city. USAID is supporting condominium promotion and training through regional housing associations in Bishkek, Osh, and Jalal-Abad. In 2000 the city of Naryn adopted a composting plan as a result of the Naryn-Great Falls, Montana partnership. Visitors from Great Falls provided immediate remedies for the redevelopment of the city water/wastewater infrastructure and offered tools to solve longer-term, capital intensive reconstruction. The city of Great Falls donated a garbage truck -- shipment is expected in spring 2001. The truck will help to cover up to 80% of the city's needs and improve garbage collection.    In 2000 the Association of Cities of the Kyrgyz Republic, representing all 20 Kyrgyz cities, established itself as an independent, non-governmental organization in order to advocate for local government interests. The association provides a counterbalance to the pro-government Congress of Local Communities. The most talented staff of the Congress has joined the new association.    In FY 2001, USAID intends to obligate $1,700,000 for training and technical assistance activities to strengthen local government management capacity.  In FY 2002, USAID will continue to support the development of accountable local government by strengthening their legal authority, improving financial and administrative operations, helping them to deliver services efficiently and strengthening the roles of elected local councils.        Beneficiaries :  The ultimate beneficiaries are city dwellers, who benefit from the opportunity to convey their priorities to local government authorities and who enjoy improved services.  Immediate beneficiaries are elected and appointed local government officials and staff, as well as officials of non-governmental housing associations and staff attending training.    Possible Adjustments to Plans : None anticipated.      Other Donor Programs : The World Bank, United Nation Development Program (UNDP), and the Soros Foundation also support activities with a local government dimension.  A UNDP decentralization program focuses on rural areas.  The Soros Foundation funds an awards program for housing associations.  USAID, in turn, publicizes the award program to condominiums and oversees its evaluation according to USAID-developed standards of what constitutes a good condominium.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies : The Urban Institute is the prime contractor of the Local Government Initiative; Barents and TRG are sub-contractors.  The International City/County Management Association is implementing a Resource Cities partnership between Naryn and Great Falls, Montana.  The Academy for Educational Development (AED) coordinates participant training.  Eurasia Foundation has provided grants to housing groups and university-based public administration programs.

GX049-80-8852438	Kyrgyzstan          >> Regional Overview    >> Kyrgyzstan Overview          Activity Data Sheet   PROGRAM:   Kyrgyzstan   TITLE & NUMBER:  Improved Management of Critical Natural Resources Including Energy, 116-0161   STATUS:   New   PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $1,000,000 FSA   PROPOSED FY 2002 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $900,000 FSA   INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 2001   ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 2005    Summary : Kyrgyzstan is located at the headwaters of major river systems in Central Asia.  Its neighboring countries depend on water resources originating in Kyrgyzstan to meet their agricultural and domestic water supply needs.  Furthermore, Kyrgyzstan depends on its water resources for a large portion of its electricity requirements.  Consequently it is important that Kyrgyzstan, in cooperation with its neighbors, manage its water resources in the most sustainable manner possible.     The purpose of this objective is to change the way that water and energy resources in Kyrgyzstan are managed, largely through training and technical assistance that will improve the management capacity of natural resources officials; improve policy and regulatory frameworks; and build public commitment.  Activities will provide a stronger basis for decision-making through better data collection systems, stronger partnerships with U.S. policy specialists, and better public relations skills.  Easily replicated, sustainable demonstration models will complement this training and technical assistance through the introduction of new cost- and resource-efficient technologies and procedures.     Program Categories  include support for environmental policy, legislation & regulation; environmental technology transfer and management of natural resources and bio-diversity.    Key Results : Four key results are required to achieve this objective: 1) increased management capacity in natural resources; 2) improved policy and regulatory framework for natural resources management; 3) sustainable models developed for integrated natural resources management; and 4) public commitment established for natural resources management policies.    Performance and Prospects : The Government of Kyrgyzstan has shown reluctance in carrying through with the energy sector privatization plans required by the World Bank. This has greatly hampered the prospects for results in the energy sector. In response, USAID is beginning to shift its energy focus to address energy efficiency issues and to support non-government organization (NGO) efforts toward more transparent pricing policies - activities that will support the long-term goal of privatization of the sector.  Despite this setback, there have been other key events over the course of the year that contribute to improved management of natural resources.    One qualified success during FY 2000 is the government's adoption of an action plan for the privatization of Kyrgyz Energo, the state energy monopoly.  This plan was developed as a result of USAID-sponsored training offered to energy officials in market-based rules and regulations, tariffs methodologies and the role of utility regulatory agencies. The government also agreed to USAID recommendations on Electricity Market Rules, which laid the legal framework for operations once privatization takes place.    In a related event in FY 2000, USAID advisors helped the company Kyrgyz Energo hold Kyrgyzstan's first ever energy utility public hearing to review an application for new utility tariffs and to receive public input on the proposed changes.  This hearing was an important first step toward greater citizen participation in the decision-making process regarding measures to reduce corrupt practices, and systems that will openly fix market-based energy tariffs.  It is also an example of strengthening democratic institutions through increasing citizen participation in key economic areas.    Resource managers of the Syr Darya River, one of the two major feeders to the Aral Sea, are using a planning tool that USAID developed to make decisions on the allocation and distribution of water and energy in the region. Local water resources economists and engineers are using our recommendations to better facilitate transboundary water discussions between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.    Building on past successes in developing policy and regulatory frameworks in transboundary water and energy resources management, further training is planned that will provide natural resources officials with a stronger basis for decision-making through better data collection systems, stronger partnerships with U.S. policy specialists, and better public relations skills.     To complement and reinforce this training, USAID is demonstrating the viability of the management concepts and new technologies in selected problem areas. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is developing a demonstration model that will help regional officials better plan for water allocation using new technologies and procedures for snowmelt forecasting and regional data sharing. Another demonstration model introduces new technologies that upgrade the control mechanisms of the irrigation system already in place in the Ferghana Valley. USAID is also working with Israel's Center for Cooperation (MASHAV) on a bio-drainage demonstration model there that presents the idea of planting carefully selected species of trees in targeted areas to help mitigate the rising water table. As part of our new focus on efficiency and transparency in the energy sector, USAID is designing other small-scale demonstration models that demonstrate more cost-effective, efficient, and self-sufficient alternatives to state utilities.    An issue that could affect performance over the coming year is a continuing drought that may raise tensions in Central Asia over fewer shared water resources and thus hinder regional activities.  This is particularly true for Kyrgyzstan, which is very dependent on hydropower, and with whom relationships are already strained in this regard.  USAID is helping the Central Asian Economic Community (CAEC) to build on the strengths of existing regional water and energy organizations to reach consensus on transboundary resource issues.     In FY 2001, USAID intends to obligate, for technical assistance, model development and training activities the following amounts per category: Environmental Policy, Legislation and Regulation, $300,000; Environmental Technology Transfer, $400,000 and Management of Natural Resources and Bio-diversity, $300,000.    In FY 2002, USAID will continue to provide natural resources officials with training  to improve resource management.  To complement and reinforce this training, models will be developed and tested to demonstrate the viability of new management concepts and technologies. Training will be continues in the use and maintenance of new technologies and procedures for snowmelt forecasting and regional data sharing, which will help regional officials to improve their planning for water allocation.  USAID will also continue to help the CAEC reach consensus among regional water and energy organizations on transboundary agreements.    Beneficiaries : The direct beneficiaries of these activities are the officials and technicians responsible for managing the natural resources in Kyrgyzstan.  Ultimately, the citizens of Kyrgyzstan will benefit from a better-managed resource base.    Possible Adjustments to Plans : Although most of the activities under this objective are new, some internal assessments of ongoing activities may call for changes.  This is especially true in the area of drafting regional agreements on water and energy, which have historically been difficult to achieve despite USAID and other donor assistance. One key assessment underway in Kyrgyzstan looks into the commitment of the new leaders in energy administration the state-owned power system to the privatization effort.     Other Donor Programs : Canada's International Development Agency is providing training to water resources officials and managers, and the Swiss Government is part of our work with NOAA in the acquisition of hydrological data. This data is also being shared with the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank.  World Bank also has a privatization program tied to energy loans.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies : PA Consulting (formerly Hagler-Bailly) is the prime contractor for the Natural Resources Management Program; The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is working with modeling systems that will help with snowmelt forecasting and data sharing; Israel's Center for Cooperation (MASHAV) will carry out efforts in the Ferghana Valley to mitigate water-logging problems; and International Resources Group works with transboundary water issues.

GX044-60-4084222	The Word On: Social Security with SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY         Q: What is the Social Security earnings test?    A: Designed during the Great Depression to encourage older workers to leave the work force to help open up jobs for younger workers, the earnings test created a penalty for Social Security beneficiaries under age 70 who collected government benefits and continued to collect a paycheck. Back then, any wages earned canceled a worker's Social Security benefits. Modified, but still in place today, the system docks those workers age 65-69 who earn more than $15,500 a year. They lose $1 of benefits for every $3 coming to them. For those who earn above $9,600 a year and choose to collect Social Security benefits under the early retirement option, ages 62-64, the penalty increases to $1 for every $2 earned.    Q: Do you support the earnings test?    A: No. For starters, we need to encourage workers to stay in the work force longer. The earnings test does little to alleviate the tight U.S. labor market and ignores the long-term challenges posed by an aging work force. Plus, it sends the wrong signal to American workers at large. As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I hosted a congressional forum in March in conjunction with Green Thumb, Inc. to honor the nation's most outstanding older workers. The winners from each of the 50 states converged on Capitol Hill and discussed why they choose to ignore the traditional retirement age. Whether older workers prefer to stay voluntarily in the workforce, or their financial situation requires them to do so, they should not get docked for earning a paycheck and contributing to the U.S. gross national product after age 65. It denigrates their work ethic and unfairly postpones their Social Security benefits. In the 104th Congress, I worked successfully to increase the earnings test to $30,000 by 2002. This year, as a senior member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, I am working to accelerate the $30,000 earnings limit by next year.

Although Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan            have not yet started meaningful decentralization, the national leaders            in both countries recognize the need to strengthen local government.            In Kyrgyzstan, the national government is experimenting with ways to            empower local governments by granting all cities self-governing status,            although exactly what that means in terms of intergovernmental relations            has not yet been determined. In Kazakhstan, local governments received            increased responsibilities in the health care and education sectors.            National debates on decentralization are ongoing. Success in local government            reform in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan can be realized by strengthening            the capacity of selected municipal governments as both democratic and            service providing institutions. Under USAID's current strategy, our            objective is to create more effective, responsive and accountable local            governance through introduction of democratic practices, strengthening            local government capacity and encouraging decentralization.            Kazakhstan            USAID is developing local training capacity by supporting a country-wide            network of Regional Local Government Training Centers through the International            City/County Management Association (ICMA). ICMA promotes public participation            techniques, such as public hearings, and provides technical assistance            to pilot local governments. Activities focus on establishing transparent            and fair municipal procedures, strengthening the role of elected local            councils, promoting local economic development, clarifying intergovernmental            roles at the oblast and lower levels, and increasing information sharing            among local officials. At the national level, USAID supports dialogue            on decentralization, comments on local government draft legislation,            and provides limited assistance to the central government and parliament            in conducting housing reform.            Kyrgyzstan            Through the Urban Institute, USAID provides technical assistance to            cities with self-government status. Activities develop more effective            and transparent procedures in financial and asset management; promote            local economic development; strengthen the role of local elected councils;            promote fair, open and competitive local procurement procedures; award            small community infrastructure grants; develop and deliver local government            training; and support national housing reform via condominium and condominium            association promotion. At the national level, USAID is drafting and            providing commentary on local government legislation, assisting the            State Property Rights Registry, and supporting the Association of Cities            of Kyrgyzstan.                                                                                                                                 Privacy  :     Plug-ins  :     FAQs    :    Help Desk  :         Contact Us  :      Site  Map  :      En Español

Please note that some formatting may have been lost in the automated conversion of the  original file. This document is also available for download in its  original  WordPerfect 5.1 format .               KYRGYZSTAN         FY 1997 Assistance to the NIS Request:  $20,000,000       Introduction.     Kyrgyzstan remains the most open of the five countries of Central Asia in terms of both economic and political change.  On the economic front, the transition, though difficult, has included some of the most far-reaching reforms in the former Soviet Union. Initial steps toward democracy were very encouraging, but more recent political developments have included some setbacks.  For example, efforts have on occasion been made to silence the press, and the disqualification of some candidates prior to recent presidential elections cast a cloud over the electoral process which followed.  Presidential moves to consolidate and centralize power also suggest that interest may be flagging in maintaining a strong parliamentary system in which many independent voices are heard.    United States strategic interests in Kyrgyzstan are twofold.  First, there is strong desire to work with Kyrgyzstan reformers to build and sustain a democratic and market-oriented country that could serve as an example to neighboring countries which seem less committed to these values.  Second, a vibrant, independent Kyrgyzstan interacting positively on a wider international stage is important to maintaining stability in an area of the world where a number of international players, including Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, and the Indian Subcontinent, have displayed strategic interests of their own.      The Development Challenge.    Kyrgyzstan is a relatively small country of 4.6 million people living in an area about the size of Nebraska.  Despite considerable out-migration over the past several years, the country remains ethnically diverse.  Ethnic Kyrgyz represent the majority population, but there are sizable communities of Russians, Uzbeks, Germans, Tatars, Uigers, and others.  Mountains cover much of the country.  There are significant hydro as well as mineral resources which enhance the country's prospects for long-term economic success.  However, Kyrgyzstan's geographic isolation, combined with the enormous investment costs in exploiting these resources makes short-term economic prospects much more problematic.    Kyrgyzstan's major achievement since independence in 1991 has been to establish the basic framework for a market economy and to maintain a commendable degree of macroeconomic stability.  In 1993 it became the first country in Central Asia to introduce its own currency.  Since then, the Kyrgyz 'som' has been remarkably stable, maintaining its value well against the dollar and other freely tradable international currencies.  Monthly inflation rates have been brought to within the low single digits and overall fiscal management has been among the best of any country in the former Soviet Union.  Foreign investment is strongly encouraged and the country's privatization is regarded as among the most ambitious of the former Soviet republics.  Kyrgystan is classified as a lesser indebted lower income country by the World Bank.     Despite overall macroeconomic stability, the standard of living has fallen and the social costs have been high.  The elimination of subsidies from Moscow represented one early concern; the disruption of existing trading systems a second concern; and the departure of many skilled technical and professional workers to Russia, Germany and elsewhere a third.  Also, the industrial sector that Kyrgyzstan inherited at independence was among the least efficient in the former Soviet Union.  It included unproductive defense-related plants and a variety of other industrial establishments that simply cannot compete in the international marketplace.            Perhaps because of its isolation and weak economic situation, Kyrgyzstan moved quickly to introduce economic reform and emerge as a leader in demonstrating commitment to bring about real and enduring change.  There are signs, especially when economic activity in the informal sector is factored in, that the post-independence recession may finally have bottomed out.  The economy is divided roughly equally among the agriculture, industry, and service sectors.  According to official statistics, agricultural performance was quite strong in 1995 and overall agricultural output appears to have increased by about eight percent.  The continued decline in industrial output appears to have been cushioned to some extent by a rise in electricity production.  Trade patterns continue to be dominated bycountries in the former Soviet Union, which still account for well over half of both imports and exports.      USAID-funded advisory groups have played an important role, both in the privatization process and in the overall economic restructuring effort.  The mass privatization program is now reaching its final stages and should be largely complete by the end of the year.  Central Asia's second stock exchange has been established in Bishkek and, despite a modest start, is positioning itself to play an important role in promoting the kind of capital market development needed to ensure that scarce financial resources are directed toward areas of highest economic return.  A new tax code is being finalized and should be implemented soon.  As the private sector begins to play an increasing role in the economy, more attention is being devoted to ensuring that appropriate legal and administrative structures are in place that promote rather than retard private sector growth.  Recent approval for creation of an independent energy regulatory agency is one important example of the type of change needed to improve efficiencies and attract foreign investment.  Further changes in the policy and administrative environment are needed to consolidate and maintain Kyrgyzstan's reputation as a country which is committed to market reform, encourages entrepreneurial talent and is hospitable to private investment.     USAID expects that Kyrgyzstan will have the institutional and other resources to continue its own transition.  Current plans are to phaseout Freedom Support Act (FSA) assistance within the next several years.      Other Donors.    Kyrgyzstan's relative openness to economic reform has attracted a large number of foreign donors.  Kyrgyzstan counterparts have demonstrated a commendable interest in ensuring that donor efforts are properly coordinated and that aid resources are stretched as far as possible.  The Japanese and several European donors are active, including Germany (in agriculture, education, health and small enterprise development) and Switzerland (in agriculture and social services).  The European Community has a wide-ranging technical assistance effort covering a number of areas, including communications, education, energy, environment and privatization.  UN agencies such as UNDP have more modest programs.  Multilateral banks such as the Asian Development (ADB), World Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are well represented.  They are expanding their loan portfolios, in some instances based in part on work undertaken by USAID-funded technical assistance teams that have been on the ground for some time.  As USAID's own resources decline, renewed efforts are being made to ensure greater coordination and, where possible, dialogue with other donors on using USAID's own past experience to extend pilot programs to a national level.      FY 1997 Program.     USAID's strategy in Kyrgyzstan emphasizes both economic and political reform, reflecting the belief that both issues must be addressed in order to build and sustain democracy and a market-based economy in Kyrgyzstan.  The largest share of aid resources are devoted to the economic transition, though the composition of the program is changing over time.  For example, the privatization program is scheduled to wind down this year and no new resources are anticipated in this area.  At the same time, work in other areas such as trade, investment, legal and regulatory environments, and land registration are due to be increased.  Democratization programs will increasingly focus on developing the basic foundations for a civil society, in large part through promoting a variety of independent means of communication and in building an indigenous non-government organizations (NGO) sector.  Social sector programs are tied closely to broader economic restructuring objectives, emphasizing for example the importance of health reform in bringing about more sustainable approaches to health care.        Strategic Goal:  Economic Restructuring       Kyrgyzstan's future hinges in large part on completing the program of economic restructuring now under way.  Considerable progress has been made on a number of fronts, particularly lowering inflation rates, maintaining currency stability, and establishing an overall level of macroeconomic stability that sets Kyrgyzstan apart from most of the other NIS countries.  Major elements of the country's privatization program are winding down following a process that has in many ways been more transparent and open than those adopted elsewhere.  As this phase of the economic transition moves to completion, increasing emphasis will need to be devoted to ensuring a legal and regulatory environment that promotes private sector growth.  Trade, investment, bankruptcy laws, financial sectordevelopment and land registration are all likely to be emphasized during the next phase of the reform process.     Considerable progress has been made on the fiscal front.  However, further work is needed to ensure that the macroeconomic progress achieved thus far is maintained.  Many of the early successes are attributable to very tight short-term fiscal management policies, including a drastic reduction in subsidies for both failed enterprises and the social sectors.  While budgetary controls have been tight, revenue generation reforms have lagged behind.  The introduction of a new tax code in the near future should help, resulting in a more rational and transparent approach to tax collections.  This in turn needs to be followed by improvements in tax administration, including greater use of computers and the introduction of a taxpayer information system.  Finally, a USAID-funded Department of Treasury advisor is helping to improve budgetary classification and ensure more effective budget management.  Reforms in the revenue generation and budget allocation process among the various elements of government (national, oblast, local) are also needed.    As noted, the legal and regulatory environment is increasingly emerging as a key issue within Kyrgyzstan's larger reform program.  Private economic actors must know the ""rules of the game"" beforehand, and potential investors must have assurance that their risks are protected by laws. Some elements of a policy, legal and regulatory framework that support competition and private sector growth are already in place, but much work still needs to be done.  Also, on- the-job training and hands-on advice is needed to ensure that new laws and regulations, once adopted, are effectively managed and implemented.      A new legal and regulatory reform initiative began in November 1995.  The emphasis is on adopting approaches that further trade and investment and on implementing legislation and regulations that clarify and strengthen property ownership and the transfer of commercial transaction rights.  Without such measures, newly privatized industries will flounder and new entrepreneurs are unlikely to enter the marketplace.  Given Kyrgyzstan's relative isolation and lack of easily exploitable natural resources, the extent to which its own legal and regulatory environment is conducive to both local and foreign investors will go a long way to determining prospects for future economic growth.    USAID has already provided crucial support in several areas of legal and regulatory reform as well as in setting up a corporate governance framework for privatized enterprises.  Land registration will be added to the housing program, which includes formation of a housing policy council and a real estate register.  The housing program is also successfully engaged in promotion of land privatization and private sector housing production, as well as formation of condominium associations able to manage and maintain housing to a much needed higher standard.  USAID advice on a draft energy law led to important modifications that called for an independent electrical utility regulatory agency and more private sector involvement, both of which are preconditions for proposed World Bank and Asian Development Bank electricity sector loans.    Systems need to be introduced that ensure that scarce capital is channeled into the areas of highest economic return.  Activity here revolves around developing the main institutions and features of an effective financial market, including the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange (KSE), State Securities Agency (SSA), private investment funds and private broker and dealer groups.  Policy advice, the transmission of technical skills and training are all important parts of this effort.    The fact that KSE opened its doors and began trading in May 1995 represents one early success, the establishment of the SSA as a licensing and oversight institution another.  The fact that the SSA has been able to establish its independence and receive appropriate enforcement powers and budget allocations is also important.  Also, an Investment Funds Association was established in October 1995.  Specifications for the clearing and settlement of transactions were established when the commercial bank ""Maskat"" was designated the clearing bank for KSE operations.    Future goals including promoting a self-sufficient securities exchange with at least 30 companies trading on the main board; assistance for a variety of automated accounting, settlement and depository systems; assistance to the SSA to enforce securities law and regulations and to train staffers about regulations and various operations; and completion of a broker/dealer compliance manual.  Over time, the emergence of efficient capital markets should also help channel foreign investment into the Kyrgyz economy.           Strategic Objective:  Increased soundness of fiscal policies and fiscal management practices           Strategic Objective:  Accelerated development and growth of private enterprises           Strategic Objective:  A more competitive and market-responsive private financial sector      Strategic Goal:   Democratic Transition     The importance of ensuring that economic reform is accompanied by political reform lies at the heart of the ongoing USG dialogue with Kyrgyzstan as it moves to build and shape its own future.  The role of free information flows, respect for human rights, the importance of an active non-governmental sector and the need to ensure widespread citizen participation are all prominent features of this effort.    Efforts to enhance the flow of information and help develop the basic features of a civil society in Kyrgyzstan take place on a number of levels.  First, USAID would like to help nurture and develop the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector as a way to enhance citizen participation and involvement.  Second, programs are underway to promote independent media, especially television.  Third, assistance is being offered to the newly elected Kyrgyz parliament in order to enhance its effectiveness.  Fourth, outreach programs involve judges and lawyers as part of an effort to improve the effectiveness of and expand the independence of the judiciary.  Finally, efforts are underway to improve the electoral process.        Viable democracies depend on the participation of all citizens, as individuals or as members of interest groups.  Virtually no NGOs existed before the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Since then, several hundred NGOs have emerged, but are poorly funded and make a limited contribution to the political, economic and social life of Kyrgyzstan.  However, the generally open environment for NGOs provides opportunities that are being increasingly realized.  USAID-funded groups work directly with such groups, providing both training and small grants to assist in program development.     A free and independent media is also a hallmark of democratic societies.  Efforts are under way to improve both the quality of independent television programming and ensure its continued financial viability.  TV officials attest to the value of these programs in redesigning studios, improving presentations,  maintaining ethical standards,  and learning how to manage a private enterprise.    While constitutional changes limit the power of the legislative branch of government, the parliament still represents a forum for public debate and can play a constructive role in ensuring that alternative voices are heard and pending legislation is properly debated and discussed before it becomes law.  USAID-funded organizations assist by providing forums for public discussion on pending legislation and in helping legislatures strengthen relationships with their constituents.     USAID-funded programs seek to involve the judiciary to help ensure a transparent law-making process.  USAID focuses on judges, bar development, and legal education. It has provided advice on legal and constitutional issues and on improving the credibility and independence of the judiciary.  In July 1995, a charter for a forty-member Voluntary Lawyer's Union of Kyrgyzstan was established.  USAID also helped organize a seminar on legislative drafting as well as candid discussions on draft legislation related to civil and criminal codes.    Finally, USAID programs have sought to improve the electoral process and, where appropriate, bring weaknesses and inconsistencies to light.  Work of this type helps strengthen the professional capacity of the Kyrgyz Central Election Commission (CEC) and improves the effectiveness of foreign observer teams.  USAID-funded groups have assisted local monitoring groups that brought claims of election fraud and other violations to the attention of news media and the CEC.  This action in turn led to reruns of some elections.            Strategic Objective:    Increased, better-informed citizens' participation in political and economic decision-making      Strategic Goal:  Social Stabilization     Social sector restructuring is closely related to the wider economic restructuring effort.  The elimination of subsidies from Moscow shortly after independence underscored the fact that existing approaches were not sustainable.  Theneed for sustainable approaches also provides a powerful impetus for devising new and innovative ways in which the state can facilitate social sector development rather than being solely responsible for funding and managing it.       USAID efforts focus on health, with the aim of introducing market-based approaches that increase individual choice and rely when possible on the private sector.  In the health area, a pilot project is under way in the Karakol region of northeastern Kyrgyzstan.  Activities include the introduction of insurance schemes, family group practices, cost- accounting and more efficient patient-discharge programs.  Based on the experience gained in Karakol, the World Bank anticipates extending this health reform effort to other oblasts.          Strategic Objective:   Improved sustainability of social benefits and services      Cross-cutting/Special Initiatives     In Kyrgyzstan, ""special initiatives"" refers to new medical partnerships and family planning.  Both represent Congressionally-mandated funding earmarks.  There is considerable interest on the part of Kyrgyz health professionals in collaborating with U.S. counterparts.  USAID also attempts when possible to ensure that these earmarks are closely integrated with other activities and address broader strategic concerns in Kyrgyzstan, especially in health reform.    The medical partnership between Kansas University Medical Center and two health institutions in Bishkek was established in 1992.  More than 130 exchange visits have already taken place, during which hospital administration and nursing care received special emphasis.  Among other things, the partnership led to the establishment of a Kyrgyzstan nursing association and outreach programs at 100 other Kyrgyz medical institutions.  The partnership also resulted in a Ministry of Health decision to institute a new position of Nurse Manager in all hospitals with more than 300 beds.  This is a revolutionary step in the former Soviet Union where nursing skills and responsibilities tended to be minimized.  New management techniques have reduced the cost of treating patients, reduced the average length of stay in a hospital, introduced fee for service approaches in some areas, and helped support the wider health reform effort.  One particularly creative approach adopted by the Institute of Oncology and Radiology cut the number of hospital beds by 30 percent.  This move emptied one building for use as a hotel for visiting friends and relatives and allowed the proceeds to be applied toward better hospital services.  Kyrgyzstan also participated in the USAID-funded reproductive health program, resulting in two fully equipped service delivery/clinical training sites in Bishkek staffed with qualified trainers and service providers.     The medical partnership involves training and people-to-people exchanges between medical staff in Kansas City and Bishkek.  In Kyrgyzstan, as elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, the partnership serves as a vehicle for raising additional private American funds and providing badly needed medical supplies and equipment to Kyrgyzstan.  Family planning programs are a combination of advisory services and training aimed at introducing new approaches and technologies to Kazakstani counterparts.    Economic and democratic reform cannot take place without a cadre of individuals from both the public and private sectors who have an understanding of markets and democratic processes.  The NIS:  Exchanges and Training (NET) program in Central Asia has been developed to supply the human resources necessary to assure this orderly transition.  The program has been designed to support USAID's technical assistance programs in the areas of economic, democratic and social sector reform and to develop cadres of officials willing and able to bring about necessary change.    NET provided U.S. short-term training for 341 officials in 1994 and 1995, with an additional 30 participants scheduled for 1996. USAID-funded participants have been instrumental in the fiscal reform, central banking operations, commercial law, accounting standards and health reform.  This effort benefits the Kyrgyz at all levels by training qualified public officials who are able to establish laws and regulations that are transparent and foster the growth of markets and democratic government. Potential entrepreneurs will benefit as they establish links with potential future U.S. commercial partners.    NET resources provide for both U.S. short-term training as well as in-country follow-on programs.  The in-country program revolves around the establishment of an Alumni Center where returning participants can utilize e-mail and fax facilities to keep in touch with U.S. trainers and contacts, as well as duplicating equipment to reproduce reportsand other materials.  The in-country follow-on program also provides for additional training through seminars and conferences, principally conducted by technical expertise located in Central Asia.  The NET program will continue, with greater emphasis on in-country training.    NET has been instrumental in assisting the Government of Kyrgyzstan in implementing  its economic restructuring program.  NET is coordinated closely with the program of other donors in Kyrgystan, a number of which also support various kinds of training.

Buckles      ACTIVITY DATA SHEET         PROGRAM:    KYRGYZSTAN    TITLE:   Fiscal Reform, 110-S001.2     STATUS:   Continuing    PROPOSED OBLIGATION:   FY 1997: $1,500,000  Freedom Support Act    INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 1993;    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 1999       Purpose :  Increased soundness of fiscal policies and fiscal management practices.     Background :  Prior to independence, Kyrgyzstan had almost no experience in formulating its own fiscal policy and administering rational and efficient tax collection and budgeting practices.  Complicated budget procedures lacked transparency and little was known about modern approaches to tax collection and revenue generation.  Given this backdrop, Kyrgyzstan has been successful in implementing a tight fiscal policy which contributes to economic stability.  For example, subsidies on both the production and consumption side have been drastically reduced.  Similarly, inflation is now around two or three percent per month, among the lowest of any countries in the former Soviet Union.  Finally, exchange rate management has been extremely effective, with the Kyrgyzstan som emerging as probably the most stable currency in the NIS.       USAID Role and Achievements to Date :  Officials at the Ministry of Finance have benefitted from USAID-funded analysis and policy advice, particularly in the fiscal area.  As noted, results include dramatically reduced inflation, currency stability and a macroeconomic environment that is among the most stable in the former Soviet Union.  USAID-funded advisors have also made major contributions to the formulation of a new tax code which is being presented to parliament and should be adopted soon.     Description :  USAID-funded consultants play an important role in providing policy advice to the Ministry of Finance.  USAID-funded advisors also played a lead role in developing a new draft tax code which, when adopted, will mark a major improvement over the highly distortive and inequitable tax system now in place.  Once the new tax code is adopted, additional assistance will be provided to help manage the new tax system.  Finally, a USAID-funded Treasury advisor is helping to design a modernized budget classification system and strengthen the budgetary implementation process.  Part of this Treasury work involves introducing new systems of inter-governmental finance and clarifying the role of the various levels of government (national, oblast, local) in raising revenue and allocating resources.     Host Country and Other Donors :  Ongoing efforts in the fiscal arena are coordinated with those of other donors, including the World Bank and EU-TACIS.     Beneficiaries :  This effort seeks to benefit tax-paying citizens of Kyrgyzstan at all levels by ensuring greater transparency and a more rational revenue collection and budgetary expenditure process.  Potential entrepreneurs will benefit as more comprehensible and transparent tax systems are adopted.  More efficient revenue collection and more rational budgetary procedures should also help strengthen the credibility of the government and help ensure the sustainability of targeted social programs aimed at the most vulnerable sections of society.     Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies :  USAID activities are implemented through a U.S. commercial contractor as well as through the U.S. Department of Treasury.     Major Results Indicators *:    Amount of (local currency) of revenues available from a cost efficient tax administration.      *   These are illustrative indicators.  ENI Missions are in the midst of the complex process of developing  measurable country-specific indicators and targets, which will be completed by June 1996.     ACTIVITY DATA SHEET         PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN    TITLE:   Private Enterprise, 110-S001.3     STATUS:   Continuing    PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   FY 1997:   $6,000,000  Freedom Support Act    INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY1993;    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 1999       Purpose :  Accelerated development and growth of private enterprises.     Background :  Given relative success in stabilizing the macro economic environment and placing government-owned assets under private control, Kyrgyzstan's future growth now depends on its ability to stimulate and promote a new and emerging indigenous private sector.  The fact that Kyrgyzstan lacks easily exploitable natural resources and the fact that it inherited one of the least efficient industrial sectors in the former Soviet Union complicates matters.  Nonetheless, there was widespread citizen participation in the mass privatization program and approximately 70 percent of the industrial labor force is expected to shortly be working for private firms.     USAID Role and Achievements to Date :  USAID is providing crucial support for promoting legal and regulatory reforms that call for broad-based privatization process, promote the breakup of regional transport and wholesale monopolies, promote effective banking and securities market regulatory guidelines, and improve the corporate governance framework for privatized firms.  Work in privatization has been especially key, ensuring among other things that the percentage of investment coupons invested in private enterprise increased from 10 percent in December 1994 to 90% in July 1995.  By June 1, 1996 virtually all of the 900 targeted medium- and large-scale firms should have gone through the coupon auction process.  As the proportion of the economy managed by the private sector expands, new emphasis is being given to the legal and regulatory environment in which private entrepreneurs must operate.  Trade and investment, bankruptcy, and general business law receive special attention.  The Central Asian American Enterprise Fund (CAAEF) represents another vehicle for bringing badly needed capital to the emerging private sector and recently started operations in Kyrgyzstan.       Description :  Support for private sector expansion represents by far the biggest area of USAID activity in Kyrgyzstan.  As USAID support for mass privatization winds down, greater emphasis is being placed on legal and regulatory work.  Advisors work with counterparts on a number of key areas, including trade and investment, bankruptcy reform and general business law reform.  Many of these efforts should also help pave the way for foreign investors interested in Kyrgyzstan.  Already, the CAAEF is making capital available to eligible local entrepreneurs.  People-to-people efforts involving retired executives, agriculturalists and others sponsored by USAID-funded groups such as the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) and the various farmer-to-farmer programs help identify potential investment opportunities and develop appropriate business plans.  Also, an innovative micro enterprise initiative is now underway, providing modest but essential amounts of loan funds to new entrepreneurs, particularly women in the rural areas around Bishkek and Osh.             Host Country and Other Donors :  Ongoing efforts to strengthen private business operations are developed in close conjunction with those of other donors, especially the World Bank, EBRD, and EU-Tacis.     Beneficiaries :  Specific beneficiaries include the hundreds of thousands of citizens of Kyrgyzstan who own shares in newly privatized government enterprises and stand to gain if these new firms increase in value or pay out dividends.  Aspiring entrepreneurs stand to benefit from a more comprehensible and more transparent legal environment.  The entire population stands to gain from a market-based economic system which creates employment, increases incomes, lower prices, and expands individual choice.      Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies :  USAID activities are implemented through several private U.S. firms as well as U.S. private voluntary organizations such IESC, FINCA and Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (VOCA).  As noted, the CAAEF is an important player because of its role in making scarce investment and equity capital available to Kyrgyzstan's emerging private sector.     Major Results Indicators *:    Volume of business support services available to private enterprises from self-sustaining local            institutions.   Number of laws implemented to expand private sector  Number of private sector businesses operating and generating employment.    *   These are illustrative indicators.  ENI Missions are in the midst of the complex process of developing  measurable country-specific indicators and targets, which will be completed by June 1996.        ACTIVITY DATA SHEET         PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN    TITLE:   Financial Reform, 110-S001.4    STATUS:   Continuing    PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   FY 1997:  $4,000,000  Freedom Support Act      INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY1993;    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 1999       Purpose :  A more competitive and market-responsive private financial sector.     Background :  Early success in the privatization arena will be unsustainable unless it is followed by the establishment and growth of a vibrant capital market to channel scarce investment resources into areas of highest economic return.  Most commercial banks are barely solvent, and there is only the most rudimentary understanding of how capital markets work.  Although Kyrgyzstan adopted basic central and commercial banking laws in December 1992, continued assistance is needed to modernize these laws and ensure effective implementation.  A strong, independent Central Bank with an effective banking supervisory capacity is needed to modernize the banking system.  The basic framework for an effective securities market also needs to be implemented and set on a sustainable footing.     USAID Role and Achievements to Date :  The formation of a State Securities Agency in 1994 represents one early achievement, the establishment of Kyrygyzstan's first stock exchange in Bishkek in 1995 another.  Twelve companies are now listed on the stock exchange board.  New corporate accounting standards have been introduced.  Significant strides have also been made as part of USAID's effort to tighten financial regulatory guidelines and enhance monitoring capacity in the banking sector.  A number of insolvent banks have had their licenses suspended as a result of this work.  These actions, and a dramatic reduction in credits and an overall tight monetary policy over the last two years, reflect the success of the Central Bank in asserting its independence.     Description :  USAID's main role is to provide technical assistance and training to nascent institutions in the financial sector.  Much of the early work--drafting and introducing new laws, procedures and operating systems--has already been done.  Now, hands-on work and on-the-job training is receiving special emphasis.       Host Country and Other Donors :  USAID is the major foreign donor working in the financial sector, and the only one involved in the securities area.  Work is coordinated closely with the World Bank as well as with other donors such as EU-TACIS.     Beneficiaries :  Immediate beneficiaries include professionals involved in securities market development such as private bankers, stock brokers, and government officials.  Newly emerging entrepreneurs as well as a broad range of Kyrgyz citizens should benefit by expanding capital markets which channel scarce financial resources in more productive directions.     Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies :  USAID activities are implemented through three private U.S. firms in cooperation with the local counterparts at the Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, the Bishkek Stock Exchange, and Securities Exchange Commission.              Major Results Indicators *:    Number of licensed, viable private commercial banks.  Amount of funding for equity/credit provided to small and medium-sized businesses from private        commercial banks.  *   These are illustrative indicators.  ENI Missions are in the midst of the complex process of developing  measurable country-specific indicators and targets, which will be completed by June 1996.     ACTIVITY DATA SHEET         PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN    TITLE:  Citizens' Participation, 110-S002.1    STATUS:   Continuing    PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   FY 1997:  $3,000,000 Freedom Support Act    INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY1993;    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 1999       Purpose :   Increased citizens' participation in political and economic decision-making.     Background :  Kyrgyzstan remains the most open Central Asian country, but there have been a number of recent setbacks on the road to democracy.  Examples include the muzzling of some newspapers, constitutional changes that limit the power of the legislature, and the disqualification of several candidates in recent presidential elections. In this environment, the importance of building and sustaining a vibrant non-government sectoral with active citizen participation and a free media becomes even more important.       USAID Role and Achievements to Date :  Active support of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remains a central part of the USAID program in Kyrgyzstan.  Through December 1995, 64 grants had been provided to local groups active in such areas as the environment, human rights, agricultural development, women's rights, media, civic education, and election law reform.  An effective USAID presence supported the presence of foreign observers at various Kyrgyz elections, ensuring that problems brought to the attention of both private groups and governmental institutions in order to improve electoral practices in future.  USAID grantees have also been influential in establishing a voluntary lawyer's union for Kygyzstan, encouraging the development of local bar associations, and promoting public discussion on pending legislation.          Description :  USAID-funded program activities largely involve technical assistance, training, and grants to local NGOs.  The local NGO sector receives special attention, in terms of the legal and regulatory environment, in terms of introducing greater professionalism and new management skills to NGOs, and in terms of effecting social change and providing needed social services.  Under a competitive small grants programs, a number of local organizations are eligible to receive direct programming support.  A new initiative will provide training to private television stations to improve programming quality and enhance their financial viability.      Host Country and Other Donors :  The United States is the major foreign donor working in the area of democratization in Kyrgyzstan.  Programs supported by the various USG agencies, including those of USAID and USIA, are closely coordinated.     Beneficiaries :  Immediate beneficiaries include individuals directly associated with Kyrgyzstan NGO sector.  Many more will benefit as various NGOs increase their public interest presence and expand their social service programs.  Tens of thousands should also benefit from improved programming and management skills at the country's independent television stations.  More broadly, all citizens stand to gain from strengthened civil society and the opportunity to help shape the future economic, political, and social life of the country.      Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies :  Several USAID-funded American NGOs such as the American Bar Association/CEELI, National Democratic Institute (NDI), Internews, International Republican Institute (IRI) and the International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) have played important roles in promoting democracy in Kyrgyzstan.  Familiar American groups such as Goodwill Industries, Aid to Artisans, and the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs, which together form The Counterpart Consortium,  also participate in local NGO development.                Major Results Indicators *:    Number of changes made to government policy as a result of citizen participation.  Number of new federations, organizations, coalitions, etc. formed to promote/oppose specific            policies/legislation-Number and types of fora in which NGOs engage state institutions in policy         debate.    *   These are illustrative indicators.  ENI Missions are in the midst of the complex process of developing  measurable country-specific indicators and targets, which will be completed by June 1996.      ACTIVITY DATA SHEET         PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN    TITLE : Social Benefits, 110-S003.2    STATUS:   Continuing    PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   FY 1997:  $1,500,000 Freedom Support Act     INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 1993;    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 1999       Purpose :   Improved sustainability of social benefits and services.     Background :  The transition to a market economy places severe strains on the social sectors, which were previously funded and managed entirely by the government.  Without subsidies from Moscow, old patterns of social service planning are no longer sustainable.  The relative macroeconomic stability which has been achieved in Kyrgyzstan stems in part from deep budget cuts, which have especially affected the social sectors.  Some medical personnel do not receive paychecks for months at a time.  Although some progress has been made, the central elements of a market-based approach to the social sectors are not yet in place.      USAID Role and Achievements to Date :  Initial USAID efforts have focused on pilot demonstration projects in the Karakol region of Kyrgyzstan.  Considerable progress has been made, including the introduction of market-based insurance schemes, establishment of 29 family group medical practices, and development of new cost accounting and patient discharge programs.  The World Bank intends to introduce and extend the successful elements of this approach to the country's other five oblasts.  USAID-funded technical assistance to the Ministry of Health resulted in revised immunization schedules consistent with international standards.  This will reduce the number of vaccinations required for children under the age of 17, reduce current expenditures on commodities by 6.7 percent, and result in annual savings of approximately $650,000.       Description :  USAID work focuses mainly on health and housing, and health represents the most significant area of concern.  At the policy level, advisors prepare analyses and discuss with government counterparts new approaches to key social sectors such as health and housing.  Training programs, both in Kyrgyzstan and in the United States, further supplement this effort.  Advisors from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are also funded, in order to improve surveillance systems and promote more effective public health strategies.     Host Country and Other Donors :  USAID work is closely coordinated with that of other donors, in order to leverage additional funding and ensure that successful pilot activities are extended to a national level.  As noted, the World Bank anticipates extending the Karakol pilot program to other regions of the country.      Beneficiaries :  Immediate beneficiaries include the population of Karakol oblast who are participating in the pilot health reform effort and have a wider choice of health care options.  Funding from other donors should allow these benefits to be spread to other regions of the country.     Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies :  The health reform effort is being implemented mainly through a commercial American contractor.  Centers for Disease Control (CDC) personnel are also actively involved in promoting better approaches to health surveillance.     Major Results Indicators *:    Number of services privatized (e.g. pharmacies, hospitals, delivery services).  Incentives for private (profit and non-profit) services exist for quality service delivery.  Market reforms in place and introduced to various sub-sector service deliverers.  *   These are illustrative indicators.  ENI Missions are in the midst of the complex process of developing  measurable country-specific indicators and targets, which will be completed by June 1996."

KYRGYZSTAN        FY 1998 Assistance to the NIS Request    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    $36,500,000        Introduction  Kyrgyzstan was one of the earliest and most active reformers among the former Soviet Union.  United States strategic interests in Kyrgyzstan are twofold.  First, there is an interest to work with reformers in Kyrgyzstan to build and sustain a democratic and market-oriented country that could serve as an example to neighboring countries which seem less committed to these values.  Second, a stable, independent Kyrgyzstan interacting positively on a wider international stage is important to maintaining stability in an area of the world where a number of international players, including Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent, have displayed strategic interests of their own.   Kyrgyzstan remains the most open of the five countries of Central Asia in both economic and political terms.  On the economic front, the transition, though difficult, has included some of the most far-reaching reforms in the former Soviet Union.  Kyrgyzstan is well on the road to macroeconomic stabilization.  After three years of sharply declining production, the Kyrgyz economy showed the first signs of recovery in 1995.  GDP growth was estimated at one percent in 1995 and preliminary data points to a growth rate of 5% in 1996.  Despite occasional setbacks, Kyrgyzstan is also the most democratic country in Central Asia.  The press is relatively free and an active parliament helps ensure that key issues are discussed and brought before a wide audience before they are acted upon.  Despite these positive developments, the most recent UNDP Human Development Plan for Kyrgyzstan underscores the difficulties faced by many Kyrgyz citizens in coping with the transition.      The Development Challenge   Kyrgyzstan is a small country of 4.6 million people living in an area about the size of Nebraska.  Despite considerable out-migration over the past several years, the country remains ethnically diverse.  Ethnic Kyrgyz represent the majority population, but there are sizable communities of Russians, Uzbeks, Germans, Tatars, Uigers, and others.  Only about seven percent of its 200,000 square kilometers is arable, with cotton, wheat, vegetables and other crops irrigated by the rivers flowing from the high mountain ranges.  There are significant hydro and mineral resources which enhance the country's prospects for long-term economic success.  However, Kyrgyzstan's geographic isolation, combined with the substantial investment costs in exploiting these resources makes short-term economic prospects more problematic.   Kyrgyzstan's major achievement since independence in 1991 has been to establish the basic framework for a market economy and to maintain a commendable degree of macroeconomic stability.  In 1993 it became the first country in Central Asia to introduce its own currency.  Since then, the Kyrgyz  som  has been relatively stable, maintaining its value well against the dollar and other freely tradable international currencies.  Monthly inflation rates have been brought to within the low single digits and overall fiscal management has been among reasonably good.  Foreign investment is strongly encouraged and the country's privatization is regarded as among the most ambitious of the former Soviet republics.  Kyrgyzstan is classified as a lesser indebted lower income country by the World Bank.    Despite overall macroeconomic stability, the standard of living has fallen and the social costs have been high.  The elimination of subsidies from Moscow, the disruption of existing trading systems, and the departure of many skilled technical and professional workers have exacerbated the economic dislocation.  The industrial sector that Kyrgyzstan inherited was among the least efficient in the former Soviet Union.  It included unproductive defense-related plants and other industrial establishments that simply cannot compete in the international marketplace.  The economy is divided roughly equally among the agriculture, industry, and service sectors.  According to official statistics, agriculturalperformance was quite strong in 1996 and overall agricultural as well as industrial output appears to be rising.  Trade patterns continue to be dominated by countries in the former Soviet Union, which still account for well over half of both imports and exports.     USAID-funded advisory groups have played an important role, both in the privatization process and in the overall economic restructuring effort.  The mass privatization program is now complete.  Central Asia's second stock exchange has been established in Bishkek and, despite a modest start, is positioning itself to play an important role in promoting the kind of capital market development needed to ensure that scarce financial resources are directed toward areas of highest economic return.  A comprehensive tax code was passed in mid-1996, characterized by the basic principles of fairness, administrative simplicity and economic neutrality.  Kyrgyzstan is the second NIS country (the other being Kazakstan) to have a comprehensive western-style tax code in place.   As the private sector begins to play an increasing role in the economy, more attention is being devoted to ensuring that appropriate legal and administrative structures are in place that promote private sector growth.  Recent approval for an independent regulatory agency for energy and the planned breakup and privatization of the parastatal which previously exercised monopoly control over the same sector are important examples of the type of changes need to improve efficiencies and attract foreign investment.  Also, a new law on economic enterprises was adopted in November 1996 and a new law on enterprise registration was adopted in September 1996, both of which should improve the business climate.  Further changes in the policy and administrative environment are needed to consolidate and maintain Kyrgyzstan's reputation as a country which is committed to market reform, encourages entrepreneurial talent and is hospitable to private investment.   Although funding mechanisms and approaches may change, USAID will likely be working with development partners in Kyrgyzstan well into the next century.  Kyrgyzstan's relative poverty, combined with its willingness to embrace reform, make it a strong candidate for continuing to receive FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) assistance.  Other Donors  Kyrgyzstan's relative openness to economic reform has attracted a large number of foreign donors.  Kyrgyzstan counterparts have demonstrated a commendable interest in ensuring that donor efforts are properly coordinated and that aid resources are stretched as far as possible.  Kyrgyzstan continues to work successfully with the IMF under a three-year Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).  The Japanese and several European donors are active, including Germany (in agriculture, education, health and small enterprise development) and Switzerland (in agriculture and social services).  The European Community has a wide-ranging technical assistance effort covering a number of areas, including communications, education, energy, environment and privatization.  UN agencies such as UNDP have more modest programs.   Multilateral banks such as the Asian Development (ADB), World Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are expanding their loan portfolios.  In some instances such as health reform, activities are based in part on work undertaken by USAID-funded technical assistance teams that have been on the ground for some time.  The World Bank's IDA program continues to focus on providing policy advice and technical assistance, balance of payments support and investment finance.  As USAID's own resources decline, renewed efforts are being made to ensure greater coordination and, where possible, dialogue with other donors on using USAID's own past experience to extend pilot programs to a national level.  FY 1998 Program USAID's strategy in Kyrgyzstan emphasizes both economic and political reform, reflecting the belief that both issues must be addressed in order to build and sustain democracy and a market-based economy.  The largest share of technical assistance resources are devoted to the economic transition, though the composition of the program is changing.  The Partnership for Freedom's new programs to encourage economic growth and develop links between Kyrgyzstanis and Americans will also begin in FY 1998.   The planned FY1998 program anticipates a continued evolution of USAID activity in the area of economic restructuring.  In the past few years, the economic restructuring program has gradually moved through a three-stage progression:  (1) primary focus on short-term economic stabilization measures designed to help bring government spending and inflation under control; (2) support for privatization of small- and medium-sized enterprises; and (3) establishment of financial markets and development of an appropriate legal infrastructure for commercial activities.  The first two stages of this process will be completed during FY1997.  In FY1998, it is envisaged that USAID will deepen its support to the third stage, in part by strengthening the now nascent financial sector through direct support to financial market institutions.  Efforts will also continue in terms of further developing the legal and commercial infrastructure and further rationalizing Kyrgyzstan's system of intergovernmental finance.   Democratization programs will increasingly focus on developing the basic foundations for a civil society, strengthening parliament, promoting independent means of communication, and building indigenous non-government organizations (NGOs).  Work in the area of effective, responsible and accountable local government is also envisaged.  Social sector programs are closely tied to broader economic restructuring objectives, for example demonstrating the importance of health and housing reform in bringing about more sustainable approaches to health care and urban living conditions.  Strategic Goal:  Economic Transition     Kyrgyzstan's future hinges in large part on completing its program of economic restructuring.  Considerable progress has been made, particularly lowering inflation rates, maintaining currency stability, and establishing an overall level of macroeconomic stability that sets Kyrgyzstan apart from most of the other NIS countries.  The country's privatization program is winding down.  As this phase of the economic transition moves to completion, the emphasis is shifting toward ensuring a legal and regulatory environment that promotes private sector growth.  Trade, investment, bankruptcy laws, financial sector development and land registration are all being emphasized.    Considerable progress has been made on the fiscal front.  However, further work is needed to ensure that the macroeconomic progress achieved thus far is maintained.  Many of the early successes are attributable to very tight short-term fiscal management policies, including a drastic reduction in subsidies for both failed enterprises and the social sector.  While budgetary controls have been tight, revenue generation reforms have lagged behind.  The introduction of the new tax code in August 1996 should help, resulting in a more rational and transparent approach to tax collections.  This in turn needs to be followed by improvements in tax administration, including greater use of computers and the introduction of a taxpayer information system.  At this point, implementation of the new tax code through more efficient tax administration is now the primary focus of USAID technical assistance in the tax reform area.  Reforms in the revenue generation and budget allocation process among the various levels of government (national, oblast, local) are also needed.   The legal and regulatory environment is emerging as a key issue within Kyrgyzstan's reform program.  Private economic actors must know the ""rules of the game"" beforehand, and investors must have assurance that their projects are protected by law. Some elements of a policy, legal and regulatory framework that support competition and private sector growth are already in place.  Important work is now underway to train the judiciary and local attorneys about contract enforcement needs, with a view toward ensuring transparency, minimizing corruption, protecting the rights of entrepreneurs, and reducing arbitrary and unnecessary licenses and other bureaucratic red tape.  Strengthening the independence of the judiciary is also important.   A legal and regulatory reform initiative began in November 1995.  The emphasis is on clarifying and strengthening property ownership and the transfer of commercial transaction rights.  Without such measures, newly privatized industries will flounder and new entrepreneurs are unlikely to enter the marketplace.  Given Kyrgyzstan's isolation and lack of easily exploitable natural resources, its legal and regulatory environment will go a long way to determining prospects for future economic growth.    USAID-funded advisors are also helping to support Kyrgyzstan's application to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).  Kyrgyzstan's WTO application documents have been praised as a model for those of other NIS countries, and the application process itself provides an important impetus for engaging with Kyrgyzstan on a wide range of trade and investment issues.    USAID has already provided crucial support in several areas of legal and regulatory reform as well as in setting up a corporate governance framework for privatized enterprises.  Land registration is the focus of a municipal development and management initiative being supported in conjunction with the World Bank.  This pilot land registration effort is vital to help create a genuine real estate market, and to stimulate the secured transactions which are so vital to developing a viable banking system and capital market.  With regard to energy, USAID advice on a draft energy law led to important modifications that called for an independent electrical utility regulatory agency and more private sector involvement, both of which are preconditions for proposed World Bank and Asian Development Bank electricity sector loans.   Systems need to be introduced to channel scarce capital into the areas of highest economic return.   USAID provided policy advice, transmission of technical skills and training are all important parts of this effort to help develop the main institutions and features of an effective financial market, including the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange (KSE), National Securities Commission (NSC), private investment funds and private broker and dealer groups.   The KSE, which opened its doors and began trading in May 1995, represents an early success.  Also, an Investment Funds Association was established in October 1995.  Specifications for the clearing and settlement of transactions were established when the commercial bank ""Maskat"" was designated the clearing bank for KSE operations.  A USAID-funded Treasury advisor is working on government securities and dealing with debt issues.  In addition, the Central Asian American Enterprise Fund represents a vehicle for bringing badly needed capital to the emerging private sector in Kyrgyzstan.   Future goals including promoting a self-sufficient securities exchange with at least 30 companies trading on the main board; assistance for a variety of automated accounting, settlement and depository systems; assistance to the NSC to enforce securities law and regulations and to train staffers about regulations and various operations; and completion of a broker/dealer compliance manual.  In time, the emergence of efficient capital markets should help attract foreign investment into the Kyrgyz economy.   Further work is needed to operationalize the independent regulatory agency for electricity; and to complete the unbundling and privatization of the Kyrgyz State Energy Holding Company (KSEHC).  Similarly, Kyrgyzstan needs to enter into water sharing and energy trade agreements with neighboring Central Asia republics to sell hydroelectricity and secure winter heating and supplies of natural gas and coal.  Such agreements will facilitate water management in the Aral Sea basin.    Strategic Objective:  Increased soundness of fiscal policies and fiscal management practices    Strategic Objective:  Accelerated development and growth of private enterprises    Strategic Objective:  A more competitive and market-responsive private financial sector      Strategic Goal:  Democratic Transition  Ensuring that economic reform is accompanied by political reform lies at the heart of the ongoing U.S. Government dialogue with Kyrgyzstan as it moves to build its future.  The role of an independent media, respect for human rights, an active non-governmental sector, rule of law, and widespread citizen participation in economic and political decision-making are all prominent features of this effort.   Efforts to enhance access to information and help develop the basic features of a civil society in Kyrgyzstan take place on a number of levels.  First, USAID is helping to nurture the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector to enhance citizen participation.  Second, programs are underway to promote independent media, especially television.  Third, assistance is being offered to the newly elected Kyrgyz parliament in order to enhance its effectiveness.  Fourth, outreach programs involve judges and lawyers as part of an effort to improve the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary.  Finally, efforts are underway to improve the electoral process.   Viable democracies depend on the participation of all citizens, as individuals or as members of interest groups.  Virtually no NGOs existed before the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Since then, several hundred NGOs have emerged.  Many tend to be poorly funded and make a limited contribution to the political, economic and social life of Kyrgyzstan.  However, the generally open environment for NGOs provides opportunities that are increasingly being realized.  USAID-funded groups work directly with such NGOs, providing both training and small grants to assist in program development.    A free and independent media is also a hallmark of democratic societies.  Efforts are under way to improve both the quality of independent television programming and ensure its continued financial viability.  TV officials attest to the value of these programs in redesigning studios, improving presentations,  maintaining ethical standards, and learning how to manage a private enterprise.   While constitutional changes shift the balance of power to the presidency, the parliament still represents a forum for public debate and can play a constructive role in ensuring that alternative voices are heard.  It also continues to control the process for discussing, amending, and passing legislation.  USAID-organizations assist by providing forums for public discussion on pending legislation and in helping legislatures strengthen relationships with their constituents.  The first public hearing, dealing with the proposed labor code, was conducted in part as a result of USAID assistance.    USAID-funded programs seek to involve the judiciary in the law-making process.  USAID focuses on judges, bar development, and legal education.  It has provided advice on legal and constitutional issues and on improving the credibility and independence of the judiciary.  A charter for a forty-member Association of Attorneys of Kyrgyzstan has been established and a USAID-funded organization is working to strengthen this new association.  An association of law students has been formed, and the judges are anxious to form an association of their own.  USAID also helped organize a seminar on legislative drafting as well as candid discussions on draft legislation related to civil and criminal codes.    USAID programs have sought to improve the electoral process and, where appropriate, bring weaknesses and inconsistencies to light.  Work of this type helps strengthen the professional capacity of the Kyrgyz Central Election Commission (CEC) which is actively working to increase its independence.  USAID provided the majority of international observers for the December 1995 presidential elections.  This year, USAID is conducting a tracking poll to follow up on its 1995 survey of voter attitudes.   Finally, USAID's existing projects involving housing, land privatization, health, and local government will serve as the base from which USAID will assist the government in its decentralization efforts and help improve the capacity of local authorities to carry out their expanded responsibilities.         Strategic Objective:  Increased, better-informed citizens' participation in political and economic decision-making    Strategic Objective:Demonstrate more effective, responsible and accountable local government  Strategic Goal:  Social Stabilization  Social sector restructuring is closely related to the wider economic restructuring effort.  The elimination of subsidies from Moscow shortly after independence underscored the fact that existing approaches were not sustainable.  The need for sustainable approaches also provides a powerful impetus for devising new and innovative ways in which the state can facilitate social sector development rather than being solely responsible for funding and managing it.      USAID efforts focus on health and housing with the aim of introducing market-based approaches that increase individual choice and rely when possible on the private sector.  A recently completed evaluation of the USAID's health reform effort concluded that ""there is a strong supporting relationship between the substantive reform of the health care system and the overall success of the transition to market oriented, democratic societies.""   USAID's health reform program has supported development and implementation of market-driven private payment schemes in Issyk-kul oblast on a pilot basis.  These mechanisms have improved the efficiency of the health delivery system in the oblast.  In addition, the program established family group practices, a process based on active local participation that now provides alternative choices for individuals in the region regarding their health car provider.   Similarly, housing programs have sought to combine policy change with practical training geared toward maintaining existing housing stocks.  The housing effort also includes formation of a housing policy council and a real estate register.  The housing program successfully promoted municipal property auctions, private sector housing construction, and the development of condominium associations.     The Mission plans to take the next step in improving the sustainability of social services by developing technical  assistance and training interventions based on the combined lessons learned from demonstrations in local self government and in health and housing.  USAID plans to work at both the national and  local level.  The goal would be to demonstrate that social sector reform can be carried out in a cost-effective manner while improving the quality and availability of services.  For example, USAID plans to expand its support for health financing schemes that contribute to long term financial sustainability in two oblasts outside the pilot oblast.  The World Bank is planning to use its resources to replicate the Issyk-kul model in two additional oblasts.  As a result, by 1999 at least 90 percent of Kyrgyzstan's population should benefit from a restructured and more efficient health care system.    Strategic Objective:  Improved sustainability of social benefits and services   Cross-cutting and Special Initiative   Special initiatives in medical partnerships, health, infectious disease control, and reproductive health will continue to be shaped to improve the sustainability of the social sector and to support the broader health reform agenda.  The medical partnership activities assisted in establishing a Kyrgyzstan nursing association.  The Ministry of Health's creation of the new position of ""nurse manager"" in hospitals with more than 300 beds, a revolutionary step in the former Soviet Union, is directly attributable to  training and technical assistance provided as a result of the medical partnership.  Both achievements help support the overall health reform program.   Training and technical assistance through a PASA with the Centers for Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta have helped to develop institutional capacity in the Ministry of Health to monitor the incidence of various diseases.  A new management information system for immunization was also introduced.   Using FY 1996 and 1997 reproductive health earmark funds, USAID has undertaken to support the Kyrgyzstan Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 1997.  This is the third DHS survey in the former Soviet Union, the first two having been conducted in Kazakstan and Uzbekistan.  It is expected to provide reliable health status data leading to more informed policy formulation and program interventions.  The reproductive health effort has resulted in two fully equipped service delivery/clinical training sites in reproductive health in Bishkek.  The contraceptive social marketing program has trained over 200 pharmacists in modern pharmacy management practices and in modern contraceptive technology.  This program has also worked to enhance the skills of both government and private individuals working in the contraceptive social marketing initiative, popularly known as the ""red apple"" program.   Economic and democratic reform cannot take place without a cadre of individuals from both the public and private sectors who have an understanding of markets and democratic processes.  The NIS  Exchanges and Training program in Central Asia has been developed to supply the human resources necessary to assure this orderly transition.  The program was designed to support USAID's technical assistance programs in economic, democratic and social sector reform and to develop cadres of officials willing and able to bring about necessary change.   USAID has provided U.S. short-term training for 420 officials between 1994 and 1996, and approximately 90 more participants are anticipated under a follow-on training program for 1997.  USAID-funded participants have been instrumental in the fiscal reform, central banking operations, commercial law, accounting standards, housing sector reform, health reform, and NGO development.  This effort benefits the Kyrgyz at all levels by training qualified public officials who are able to establish laws and regulations that are transparent and foster the growth of markets and democratic government.  Potential entrepreneurs will benefit as they establish links with potential future U.S. commercial partners.   Training programs support both U.S. short-term training as well as in-country follow-on programs.  The in-country program includes establishment of a Resource Center in Bishkek where returning participants can utilize e-mail and fax facilities to keep in touch with U.S. trainers and contacts, as well as duplicating equipment to reproduce reports and other materials.  Future efforts will emphasize in-country and third-country training approaches.

Buckles               ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN     TITLE:   Fiscal Reform, 110-S001.2      STATUS:   Continuing     PROPOSED OBLIGATION:   FY 1998:  $1,500,000  FREEDOM Support Act     INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 1993;   ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 1999    Purpose:   Increased soundness of fiscal policies and fiscal management practices.    Background:   Prior to independence, Kyrgyzstan had almost no experience in formulating its own fiscal policy and administering rational and efficient tax collection and budgeting practices.  Complicated budget procedures lacked transparency and little was known about modern approaches to tax collection and revenue generation.  Given this backdrop, Kyrgyzstan has been successful in implementing a tight fiscal policy which contributes to economic stability.  Subsidies on both the production and consumption side have been drastically reduced.  Similarly, inflation is now negligible, reflecting a performance with few parallels anywhere else in the former Soviet Union.  Finally, exchange rate management has been extremely effective.  Over the past two years, the Kyrgyz som  has been among the most stable currency in the NIS, though a major devaluation appears to be taking place in the face of a large trade imbalance.    USAID Role and Achievements to Date:   Officials at the Ministry of Finance have benefitted from USAID-funded analysis and policy advice, particularly in the fiscal area.  As noted, results include dramatically reduced inflation, currency stability and a macroeconomic environment that is among the most stable in the former Soviet Union.  USAID-funded advisors also had the lead role in formulating the new tax which was introduced on August 1, 1996.  Current technical assistance focuses mainly on implementation of the new tax code.    Description:   In FY1998, USAID technical assistance in the fiscal area will concentrate mainly on further rationalization of Kyrgyzstan's system of intergovernmental finance, with a view toward  ensuring that various levels of government operate with greater economic efficiency in implementing their taxation and expenditure authority.      Host Country and Other Donors:   Ongoing efforts in the fiscal arena are coordinated with those of other donors, including the World Bank and EU-TACIS.    Beneficiaries:   This effort seeks to benefit tax-paying citizens of Kyrgyzstan at all levels by ensuring greater transparency and a more rational revenue collection and budgetary expenditure process.  Potential entrepreneurs will benefit as more comprehensible and transparent tax systems are adopted.  More efficient revenue collection and more rational budgetary procedures should also help strengthen the credibility of the government and help ensure the sustainability of targeted social programs aimed at the most vulnerable sections of society.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies:   USAID activities are implemented through a U.S. commercial contractor as well as through the U.S. Department of Treasury.

Background:   Given relative success in stabilizing the macroeconomic environment and placing government-owned assets under private control, Kyrgyzstan's future growth now depends on its ability to stimulate and promote a new and emerging indigenous private sector.  The fact that Kyrgyzstan lacks easily exploitable natural resources and the fact that it inherited one of the least efficient industrial sectors in the former Soviet Union complicates matters.  Nonetheless, there was widespread citizen participation in the mass privatization program and approximately 70 percent of the industrial labor force is expected shortly to be working for private firms.    USAID Role and Achievements to Date:   USAID is providing crucial support for promoting legal and regulatory reforms that call for broad-based privatization process, the breakup of regional transport and wholesale monopolies, effective banking and securities market regulatory guidelines, and improvements  in the corporate governance framework of privatized firms.  Work in privatization has been especially key, ensuring among other things that the percentage of investment coupons invested in private enterprise increased from 10 % in December 1994 to 90% in July 1995.  By mid-1996, most of the 900 targeted medium- and large-scale firms had gone through the coupon auction process.   To stimulate private foreign investment in energy, an independent regulatory agency for energy has been established.  Monopoly control over the energy sector by a parastatal has been removed.  Plans are being made to break the same parastatal and to privatize major components of the energy sector.  As the proportion of the economy managed by the private sector expands, new emphasis is being given to the legal and regulatory environment in which private entrepreneurs must operate.  Trade and investment, bankruptcy, and general business law receive special attention.  The Central Asian American Enterprise Fund (CAAEF) represents another vehicle for bringing badly needed capital to the emerging private sector and recently started operations in Kyrgyzstan.    Description:   In FY1998, support for private enterprise reform will focus mainly on further commercial law development and related areas such as support for accounting reform at the enterprise level.  Among other things, the support activities will assist Kyrgyzstan in developing a financial sector that is more open and transparent and therefore less susceptible to corrupt practices.    Host Country and Other Donors:   Ongoing efforts to strengthen private business operations are developed in close conjunction with those of other donors, especially the World Bank, EBRD, and EU-TACIS.    Beneficiaries:   Specific beneficiaries include the hundreds of thousands of citizens of Kyrgyzstan who own shares in newly privatized government enterprises and stand to gain if these new firms increase in value or pay out dividends.  Aspiring entrepreneurs stand to benefit from a more comprehensible and more transparent legal environment.  The entire population stands to gain from a market-based economic system which creates employment, increases incomes, lower prices, and expands individual choice.     Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies:   USAID activities are implemented through several private U.S. firms as well as U.S. private voluntary organizations such IESC, FINCA and Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (VOCA).  As noted, the CAAEF is an important player because of its role inmaking scarce investment and equity capital available to Kyrgyzstan's emerging private sector.

Background:   Early success in the privatization arena will be unsustainable unless it is followed by the establishment and growth of a vibrant capital market to channel scarce investment resources into areas of highest economic return.  Most commercial banks are barely solvent, and there is only the most rudimentary understanding of how capital markets work.  Although Kyrgyzstan adopted basic central and commercial banking laws in December 1992, continued assistance is needed to modernize these laws and ensure effective implementation.  A strong, independent Central Bank with an effective banking supervisory capacity is needed to modernize the banking system.  The basic framework for an effective securities market also needs to be implemented and set on a sustainable footing.    USAID Role and Achievements to Date:   The formation of a National Securities Commission represents one important achievement, the establishment of Kyrgyzstan's first stock exchange in Bishkek in 1995 another.  More than twenty companies are now listed on the stock exchange board.  New corporate accounting standards have been introduced.  Significant strides have also been made as part of USAID's effort to tighten financial regulatory guidelines and enhance monitoring capacity in the banking sector.  A number of insolvent banks have had their licenses suspended as a result of this work.  These actions, and a dramatic reduction in credits and an overall tight monetary policy over the last two years, reflect the success of the Central Bank in asserting its independence.    Description:   USAID's main role is to provide technical assistance and training to nascent institutions in the financial sector.  Much of the early work--drafting and introducing new laws, procedures and operating systems--has already been done.  Now, hands-on work and on-the-job training is receiving special emphasis.  In FY1998,  USAID will continue to provide  assistance to the financial sector in these and related areas.      Host Country and Other Donors:   USAID is the major foreign donor working in the financial sector, and the only one involved in the securities area.  Work is coordinated closely with the World Bank as well as with other donors such as EU-TACIS.    Beneficiaries:   Immediate beneficiaries include professionals involved in securities market development such as private bankers, stock brokers, and government officials.  Newly emerging entrepreneurs as well as a broad range of Kyrgyz citizens should benefit by expanding capital markets which channel scarce financial resources in more productive directions.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies:   USAID activities are implemented through three private U.S. firms in cooperation with the local counterparts at the Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, the Bishkek Stock Exchange, and National Securities Commission.

Background:   Despite occasional setbacks along the way, Kyrgyzstan remains the most open Central Asian country.   In particular, there have been many recent examples of steps to expand information flows and promote greater transparency in the government decision-making process.  For example, with USAID support a Consultative Council on Legal Reform provides a new mechanism for the executive, parliament, donors, NGOs and private citizens to gain access to information and participate in planning and discussing the ongoing reform program.      USAID Role and Achievements to Date:   Active support of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remains a central part of the USAID program in Kyrgyzstan.  By one estimate, some 420 NGOs were active  in a variety of areas, including environment, human rights, agricultural development, women's rights, media, civic education, and election law reform.  This number represents an increase of 157 NGOs over the previous year.  Civic education programs are being developed, based partly on the results of a USAID-funded survey tracking voter opinions and attitudes.  USAID grantees have also been influential in establishing a voluntary lawyer's union for Kyrgyzstan, encouraging the development of local bar associations, providing comments on draft legislation, and promoting public discussion on pending legislation.    Description:   USAID-funded NGO activities largely involve technical assistance, training, and grants to local NGOs.  The local NGO sector receives special attention, in terms of the legal and regulatory environment, in terms of introducing greater professionalism and new management skills to NGOs, and in terms of effecting social change and providing needed social services.  Under a competitive small grants programs, a number of local organizations are eligible to receive direct programming support.  A new initiative will provide training to private television stations to improve programming quality and enhance their financial viability.     Host Country and Other Donors:   The United States is the major foreign donor working in the area of democratization in Kyrgyzstan.  Programs supported by the various U.S. Government agencies, including those of USAID and USIA, are closely coordinated.    Beneficiaries:   Beneficiaries include members of Kyrgyzstan's NGOs, independent television stations, lawyers, members of the judiciary, members of parliament and the public at large.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies:   Several USAID-funded American NGOs such as the American Bar Association/CEELI, National Democratic Institute (NDI), Internews, and the International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) have played important roles in promoting democracy in Kyrgyzstan.  Familiar American groups such as Goodwill Industries, Aid to Artisans, and the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs, which together form The Counterpart Consortium,  also participate in local NGO development.      Major Results Indicators:          Baseline          Target  No. of Advocacy NGOs               0 (1992)          400 (1999)   No. of draft laws and policies     0 (1992)          16 (1999)   with NGO input                       No. of independent stations        0 (1994)            7 (1999)                ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN     TITLE:   More effective, responsible, and accountable local government  110-S002.3     STATUS:   New     PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   FY 1998  $2,000,000  FREEDOM Support Act     INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 1998    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 2001    Purpose:   Demonstrate more effective, responsible, and accountable local government    Background:   Kyrgyzstan, with limited arable land and a lack of readily accessible natural resources, has embraced the ideals of market reform as its only path forward.  However, economic hardship continues and economic difficulties affecting large numbers of the population threatens the economic transition process as a whole.  One approach toward dealing with these problems is decentralization, providing local authorities with greater responsibility for both raising revenue and determining how that revenue is spent.   At this point, Kyrgyzstan is far ahead of its neighbors in terms of delegating decision-making authority to local authorities.  The range of legislation related to this area over just the past year is impressive.  For example, progressive changes in the tax law allows designation of certain taxes to different levels of government.  The October 1996 Presidential decree encourages formation of municipal associations as well as the development of municipal charters as the primary documents of local government.   USAID training and technical assistance have helped to demonstrate the benefits associated with effective, responsible, and accountable local government in one pilot test site.  Using this model, USAID demonstrated how activity in health and housing can usefully be carried out at a local level for maximum effectiveness.  Similarly, USAID's activity in intergovernmental finance supports the critical element of creating a resource base for social sector reform.  The time is opportune in Kyrgyzstan to address the generic issues relative to financing and administration of social benefits and services in addition to the more sector specific issues covered under Strategic Objective 3.2 (Improved sustainability of social services and benefits).    USAID Role and Achievements to Date:   USAID implemented the Municipal Finance and Management (MFM) Project in Central Asia as part of the Democratic Pluralism Initiatives (DPI) program from 1994 through 1996.  Karakol, Kyrgyzstan was chosen as one of two municipalities in Central Asia (the other being Atyrau, Kazakstan) in which to implement the project.  An external evaluation, marking the completion of the project, was conducted in October 1996, with a view toward providing further information about possible future directions.  The evaluation concluded that significant strides towards democracy building were made, especially in view of the short life cycle of the project.  Key events highlighted included preparation and use of a city budget; a significant increase in the percent of taxes received and retained in Karakol; the introduction and use of computer systems and software in the tax and finance departments; and the preparation of a draft city charter for Karakol that is now under consideration.  The establishment of an information office and increased media exposure also increases transparency and makes local citizens more aware of developments related to local government.  In addition, USAID is now implementing a pilot land registration process for use by municipalities.  This project,  which will be expanded with World Bank resources, is critical for ensuring that local governments have the revenue base needed to effectively carry out their responsibilities. In addition, this project will support USAID-assisted efforts at providing privatization of land at the local level through land auctions and encouragement of private sector real estate development.    Description:   USAID believes the time is appropriate to expand the initiative begun in Karakol to other oblasts and municipalities in Kyrgyzstan.  The inability of the central government to meet subsidy requirements at the local level is motivating policy makers to devolve key financial and other authorities to the local level.  USAID would build on lessons learned from the MFM and housing reform projectsand from other donors to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.  USAID funded training and technical assistance would be directed to the national as well as selected local levels to facilitate decentralization reforms.   The October 24, 1996 decree by the President of Kyrgyzstan ""On the Measures for On-Going Improvement of Local Self-Governments in the Kyrgyz Republic"" sets the stage for continued assistance.  As one recent EU-TACIS activity concluded, there are very few additional resources available to local governments in the near term--and the only hope for providing municipal services is through increased efficiency.  In keeping with this view, USAID plans to support administrative development at the local government level.  Activities will be closely coordinated with ongoing assistance in the development of local resource bases to guarantee a degree of fiscal independence to local government, in the development of indigenous nongovernmental organizations, and in the development of sustainable social services.    Host Country and Other Donors:   USAID will work closely with the various governmental entities involved in local government issues, including ministries, the presidential apparat, parliament, local level officials and government employees.  A number of other donors also support activities with a local government dimension, including the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and EU-TACIS.    Beneficiaries:   Elected officials and government employees at the oblast and municipal level will benefit directly.  Also, private citizens of Kyrgyzstan, especially those classified as part of the ""vulnerable group"" (i.e., elderly pensioners, women, and children) will benefit from improvements in the social safety net and more targeted and effective social services.   Principle Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies:  To be determined.  Mission plans to ""buy in"" to existing assistance mechanisms or to competitively procure services depending on which will provide the best benefit to the U.S. Government, cost and other factors considered.   Major Results Indicators:*      *This is a new strategic objective,  indicators and targets will be finalized during the next planning period.                   ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM:   KYRGYZSTAN     TITLE:   Improve the sustainability of social benefits and services 110-3003.2     STATUS:   Continuing     PROPOSED OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   FY 1998 $3,000,000 FREEDOM Support Act     INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 1993;    ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:    FY 2001    Purpose:  Improved sustainability of social benefits and services.    Background:   The social sector in Kyrgyzstan, which was previously funded and managed entirely by the government, continues to be severely strained as the country moves from a planned economy to a market oriented one.  A key determinant of the overall success and sustainability of the reforms will be the ability of the government and the private sector to develop and administer efficient and cost-effective social services.  Under this Strategic Objective, USAID has focused attention on the health and housing areas.  Progress made to date needs to be deepened to ensure the sustainability of well targeted social benefits and services in a market economy.  One strategy for deepening the reform is coordinated work at the local level, as has already been shown in an intensive demonstration site at Karakol.  Thus, work on this Strategic Objective will be coordinated with work on the Strategic Objective for local self government and with assistance provided by other donors.    USAID Role and Achievements to Date:  USAID's most significant achievements in restructuring the health sector in Kyrgyzstan has been the pilot health reform project in Issyk-kul Oblast. Considerable progress has been made.  Market-based insurance schemes were introduced.  Eighty-one new family group practices have been established within the past year in the pilot oblast, resulting in a shift from costly hospital-based care to less expensive outpatient treatment.  Eighty percent of the entire population of Issyk-kul has now enrolled in the family group practice of their choice.  A new provider payment system which encourages primary care physicians to treat more and refer less to specialty hospitals was instituted.  A rationalization of health resources plan was also introduced, resulting in the closure of one inefficient hospital. Given the success of the early pilot effort, World Bank funds are being used to extend the Issyk-kul work into two other oblasts.   The housing sector program has focused on working with government counterparts at the local and national level to develop a system for transferring authority for housing maintenance to those with the highest stake, namely the residents and owners of the buildings in question.  In 1997 and again in 1998, efforts will be made to implement and broaden the policy changes adopted in 1996, with a view toward solidifying private ownership and maintenance.  Finally, USAID programs directed toward NGOs also have an important local government dimension and can be used  both to ensure more effective social delivery and bring about change in targeted communities.    Description:   USAID, a key player in assisting the social sector reforms in Kyrgyzstan since 1993, anticipates taking further steps to deepen the reform efforts.  At this point, USAID plans to focus and complete the pilot work in Issyk-kul oblast.  This will make it fully operational and provide a viable health reform model for the World Bank to replicate in two other oblasts.  In addition, USAID will concentrate on national health reform policy development based on lessons learned in Issyk-kul.  USAID will complement World Bank efforts by providing health reform assistance in an additional two oblasts.  The combined USAID and World Bank efforts would thus ensure that some 90 percent of Kyrgyzstan's population is covered by a health care delivery system consistent with a market-oriented economy in a democratic society. USAID may also assist the government in attempts to rationalize and reduce subsidies for housing and municipal services at the local level.    Host Country and Other Donors:   Various Government of Kyrgyzstan ministries, local level government officials and government employees, World Bank, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO and EU-TACIS are all involved in activities with a local government dimension.  As noted, the World Bank is an importantpartner in a number of activities related to social sector reform.    Beneficiaries:   Immediate beneficiaries include physicians in family group practices and their clients.  Ultimately, at least ninety percent of the citizens of Kyrgyzstan benefit, especially those in that segment of the population classified as vulnerable (e.g., elderly pensioners, women, children).    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies:   Abt Associates, Inc. is working in the health reform arena.  International City and County Managers Association (ICMA) is working in the housing sector.

Inputs, Outputs, and Activities:   FY 2002 Program:  USAID will help the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to streamline tax administration to increase efficiency, reduce corruption and introduce fairness and consistency.  USAID will also work with the MOF to improve in-system and intergovernmental finance.  A continued focus on more accurate automated revenue and expenditure systems will enable ministries to improve the allocation and management of revenues at the local level, especially for health and education.  USAID will assist local governments to adopt transparent budgeting practices to reduce waste and abuse and control spending.  Finally, in FY 2002, USAID will perform an evaluation of the fiscal environment in Kyrgyzstan.      FY 2003 Program:  USAID plans to continue to provide technical assistance and training to help the Government of Kyrgyzstan (GOK) develop policies and procedures that will help to bring about a stable and sound fiscal environment.  USAID advisors will work with the MOF, Office of the President, Parliament, and the Tax Inspectorate to streamline tax policy and administration, budget analysis and development, and intergovernmental.   Assistance to local governments will include technical assistance and training for select regional administrations on the improvement of their budget and finance processes.  Such assistance is targeted at fostering greater decentralization and more efficient use of scarce public resources.    Performance and Results:  USAID's consistent success in increasing the soundness of tax and budget policies and administration has been notable. USAID advisors played a key role in the government's decision to implement budget instructions requiring agencies to prepare program savings options for government consideration. Advisors were also instrumental in developing and fully implementing the former Soviet Union's first-ever Letter Rulings Database (LRD), which will compile decisions made by the tax authorities in response to taxpayer inquiries and will be available to the public. The letter based ruling system will improve transparency and bring about greater consistency in decisions made by the tax authorities. USAID technical staff also played a pivotal role in developing a new patent tax system that is now operational and expected to raise approximately 100 million som per year.    USAID's support to a modernized, more efficient tax policy is a key factor in the 25.3% increase in tax collection over last year.   A joint effort of USAID's Fiscal and Democracy programs has also brought more transparency to the budget approval process, improving the quality of budget analysis by Parliamentarians, and improving the quality of the budget itself. Following public hearings on the 2002 budget, USAID received the commitment of the Budget Committee to hold public hearings at least quarterly. Moreover, there will be full public disclosure of all budget information on the Internet.    USAID's support to a modernized, more efficient tax policy is a key factor in the 25.3% increase in tax collection over last year. Further funding of this Strategic Objective will result in further improvements in tax compliance, more effective use of scarce public resources and greater transparency both at the national and local levels. According to USAID's current strategy fiscal reform efforts are winding down, and it is anticipated that Kyrgyzstan will graduate from this strategic objective by the end of the strategy period in 2002.    Because work at the city and oblast levels has just begun, there are no results to report as of yet.

GX049-53-11531450	"Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy        March 4, 1987   My fellow Americans: -      I've spoken to you from this historic office on many  occasions and about many things. The power of the Presidency is often thought to  reside within this Oval Office. Yet it doesn't rest here; it rests in you, the American  people, and in your trust. Your trust is what gives a President his powers of  leadership and his personal strength, and it's what I want to talk to you about this  evening.    For the past 3 months, I've been silent on the revelations about Iran. And you  must have been thinking: ""Well, why doesn't he tell us what's happening? Why  doesn't he just speak to us as he has in the past when we've faced troubles or  tragedies?"" Others of you, I guess, were thinking: ""What's he doing hiding out in  the White House?"" Well, the reason I haven't spoken to you before now is this: You  deserve the truth. And as frustrating as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper  to come to you with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which  would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's  been enough of that.    I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence. But I've  had to wait, as you have, for the complete story. That's why I appointed Ambassador  David Abshire as my special counselor to help get out the thousands of documents  to the various investigations. And I appointed a special review board, the Tower  board, which took on the chore of pulling the truth together for me and getting to  the bottom of things. It has now issued its findings.    I'm often accused of being an optimist, and it's true I had to hunt pretty hard to  find any good news in the Board's report. As you know, it's well-stocked with  criticisms, which I'll discuss in a moment; but I was very relieved to read this  sentence: ""... the Board is convinced that the President does indeed want the full  story to be told."" And that will continue to be my pledge to you as the other  investigations go forward.    I want to thank the members of the panel: former Senator John Tower, former  Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former national security adviser Brent  Scowcroft. They have done the Nation, as well as me personally, a great service by  submitting a report of such integrity and depth. They have my genuine and  enduring gratitude.    I've studied the Board's report. Its findings are honest, convincing, and highly  critical; and I accept them. And tonight I want to share with you my thoughts on  these findings and report to you on the actions I'm taking to implement the Board's  recommendations.    First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my  administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my  knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in  some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people  for this behavior. And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and  diverted funds -  well, as the Navy would say, this happened on my watch.    Let's start with the part that is the most controversial. A few months ago I told  the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best  intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not As  the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in  its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own  beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind. There  are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a mistake.    I undertook the original Iran initiative in order to develop relations with those  who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government. It's clear from the  Board's report, however, that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over  into the geo- political strategy of reaching out to Iran. I asked so many questions  about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total  Iran plan.    Let me say to the hostage families: We have not given up. We never will. And I  promise you we'll use every legitimate means to free your loved ones from  captivity. But I must also caution that those Americans who freely remain in such  dangerous areas must know that they're responsible for their own safety.    Now, another major aspect of the Board's findings regards the transfer of funds  to the Nicaraguan contras.  The Tower board wasn't able to find out what happened  to this money, so the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the  court-appointed Independent Counsel and the two congressional investigating  committees. I'm confident the truth will come out about this matter, as well. As I  told the Tower board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the contras. But  as President, I cannot escape responsibility.    Much has been said about my management style, a style that's worked  successfully for me during 8 years as Governor of California and for most of my  Presidency. The way I work is to identify the problem, find the right individuals to  do the job, and then let them go to it. I've found this invariably brings out the best  in people. They seem to rise to their full capability, and in the long run you get more  done.    When it came to managing the NSC staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its  previous track record. I've already begun correcting this. As a start, yesterday I met  with the entire professional staff of the National Security Council. I defined for  them the values I want to guide the national security policies of this country. I told  them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it  was in secret. I wanted a policy that reflected the will of the Congress as well as of the  White House. And I told them that there'll be no more freelancing by individuals  when it comes to our national security.    You've heard a lot about the staff of the National Security Council in recent  months. Well, I can tell you, they are good and dedicated government employees,  who put in long hours for the Nation's benefit. They are eager and anxious to serve  their country.    One thing still upsetting me, however, is that no one kept proper records of  meetings or decisions. This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an  arms shipment before or after the fact. I did approve it; I just can't say specifically  when. Well, rest assured, there's plenty of recordkeeping now going on at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue.    For nearly a week now, I've been studying the Board's report I want the  American people to know that this wrenching ordeal of recent months has not been  in vain. I endorse every one of the Tower board's recommendations. In fact, I'm  going beyond its recommendations so as to put the house in even better order.    I'm taking action in three basic areas: personnel, national security policy, and  the process for making sure that the system works. First, personnel -  I've brought in  an accomplished and highly respected new team here at the White House. They  bring new blood, new energy, and new credibility and experience.    Former Senator Howard Baker, my new Chief of Staff, possesses a breadth of  legislative and foreign affairs skills that's impossible to match. I'm hopeful that his  experience as minority and majority leader of the Senate can help us forge a new  partnership with the Congress, especially on foreign and national security policies.  I'm genuinely honored that he's given up his own Presidential aspirations to serve  the country as my Chief of Staff.    Frank Carlucci, my new national security adviser, is respected for his experience  in government and trusted for his judgment and counsel. Under him, the NSC staff  is being rebuilt with proper management discipline. Already, almost half the NSC  professional staff is comprised of new people.    Yesterday I nominated William Webster, a man of sterling reputation, to be  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Webster has served as Director of  the FBI and as a U.S. District Court judge. He understands the meaning of ""rule of  law.""    So that his knowledge of national security matters can be available to me on a  continuing basis, I will also appoint John Tower to serve as a member of my Foreign  Intelligence Advisory Board. I am considering other changes in personnel, and I'll  move more furniture, as I see fit, in the weeks and months ahead.    Second, in the area of national security policy, I have ordered the NSC to begin a  comprehensive review of all covert operations. I have also directed that any covert  activity be in support of clear policy objectives and in compliance with American  values. I expect a covert policy that if Americans saw it on the front page of their  newspaper, they'd say, ""That makes sense."" I have had issued a directive prohibiting  the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations -  no ifs, ands, or buts. I have  asked Vice President Bush to reconvene his task force on terrorism to review our  terrorist policy in light of the events that have occurred.    Third, in terms of the process of reaching national security decisions, I am  adopting in total the Tower report's model of how the NSC process and staff should  work. I am directing Mr. Carlucci to take the necessary steps to make that happen.  He will report back to me on further reforms that might be needed. I've created the  post of NSC legal adviser to assure a greater sensitivity to matters of law.    I am also determined to make the congressional oversight process work. Proper  procedures for consultation with the Congress will be followed, not only in letter  but in spirit Before the end of March, I will report to the Congress on all the steps  I've taken in line with the Tower board's conclusions.    Now, what should happen when you make a mistake is this: You take your  knocks, you learn your lessons, and then you move on. That's the healthiest way to  deal with a problem. This in no way diminishes the importance of the other  continuing investigations, but the business of our country and our people must  proceed. I've gotten this message from Republicans and Democrats in Congress,  from allies around the world, and -  if we're reading the signals right -  even from  the Soviets. And of course, I've heard the message from you, the American people. You know, by the time you reach my age, you've made plenty of mistakes. And  if you've lived your life properly -  so, you learn. You put things in perspective. You  pull your energies together. You change. You go forward.    My fellow Americans, I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and  for you over the next 2 years. And the Lord willing, that's exactly what I intend to  do.    Good night, and God bless you."

As I said in my 1999 State of the Union Address, ""we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.""  The retirement earnings test was created during the Great Depression to encourage older workers to retire in order to open up more jobs for younger workers.  As the baby boomers begin to retire, it is more important than ever that older Americans who are willing and able to work, should not have their Social Security benefits deferred when they do.    We should reward every American who wants to and can stay active and productive.  I encourage Congress to send me a clean, straightforward bill to eliminate the retirement earnings test above the normal retirement age.    Eliminating the retirement earnings test above the normal retirement age is a first step toward Social Security reform.  I remain committed to making bipartisan progress on Social Security this year.  I ask Congress to pass legislation that would extend the solvency of Social Security to about 2050 while taking significant actions to reduce poverty among elderly women.  Last year I transmitted legislation to Congress that would have used the interest savings earned by paying down the debt to make Social Security stronger.  If we agree to this simple step, we can extend the life of Social Security to the middle of the next century while also modernizing Social Security to reduce poverty among elderly women.    Moving forward on these two, simple steps would be a substantial down payment on Social Security reform.  It would demonstrate that we can work together, building the bipartisan trust necessary to finish the job of meeting the long-term Social Security challenge.                                Sincerely,      WILLIAM J. CLINTON                                          # # #"
GX030-59-8298896	"Kyrgyzstan   FY 2001 Program Description and Activity Data Sheets         >> Regional Overview    >> Kyrgyzstan Overview               FY 2001 Program    Highest priority will be    given to assistance which promotes economic growth, democratization and the    prevention of conflict in the South. USAID will continue to expand its programs    throughout the Fergana Valley as part of a long-term strategy to increase economic    development and stability in the south.       USAID will initiate a land    reform program to build on the recent passage of the land and registration laws.    Efforts will include developing land registration systems, educating citizens    about their legal rights, and amendments to the land laws. USAID will continue    efforts to improve tax administration, the legal and commercial infrastructure,    intergovernmental finance, bankruptcy laws, accounting practices, and the professional    capabilities of judges and attorneys. Further progress will be made toward the    creation of an independent regulatory agency for electricity; environmental    resource and energy development initiatives will be covered in the Central Asia    Regional program.       Ensuring that economic reform    is accompanied by social and political reform is a continuing priority. Programs    will continue to strengthen civil society, promote independent media, solidify    the rule of law, furnish election assistance, and deepen respect for human rights.    USAID will work toward the development of accountable local government by seeking    to strengthen a legal authority, improve financial and administrative operations,    deliver services efficiently, and strengthen the role of elected local councils.    Increased attention will be paid to improving women's legal rights and their    participation in the political process.       In the health sector the    emphasis will be on infectious disease control and rolling out USAIDs very    successful health care models. USAID will support cost-effective health reform    through Family Group Practices. Infectious disease diagnosis and prevention    and reproductive health care will be integrated into this primary health care    unit.       A significant amount of FREEDOM Support Act    (FSA) funding will be provided in FY 2000 and 2001 under the Administrations    Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative (ETRI) for programs designed to enhance    border security and export control capabilities. ETRI will contribute to the    nonproliferation of weaponsof mass destruction, and associated delivery    systems, materials, technologies and expertise.            [an error occurred while processing this directive]               ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM : Kyrgyzstan    TITLE AND NUMBER:  Increased    Soundness of Fiscal Policies and Fiscal Management Practices, 116-012  PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING    SOURCE : $2,700,000 FSA  PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING    SOURCE:  $3,500,000 FSA  STATUS : Continuing  INITIAL OBLIGATION : FY 1993    ESTIMATED    COMPLETION DATE : FY 2001  Summary:  This objective    is critical to combat the fiscal crisis in the country. As a result of the economic    crisis in Russia, and the devaluation of the  tenge  in neighboring Kazakhstan,    domestic and foreign investors in Kyrgyzstan are less confident. During 1999,    the  som  fell in value by half and the interest rate on government securities    stood at 50% at year-end. As a result of the currency depreciation, inflation    rose to 18.4%. Moreover, the government faced growing concerns regarding its    ability to service its large external debt. Although official statistics indicate    GDP grew slightly last year, unofficial estimates indicate a decline. In order    to survive the current crisis, the government needs to increase tax compliance,    formulate budgets that are consistent with revenue projections, improve its    forecasting ability, and reduce its external debt. USAID activities in this    area support the U.S. Embassys Mission Performance Plan by supporting the transition    to a free-market economy.      USAID is addressing the immediate    and long-term needs by targeting three critical areas: 1) tax administration;    2) tax policy; and 3) budget reform. Tax administration addresses the governments    need to reduce its borrowing by increasing tax revenues.       The direct beneficiaries    of sound fiscal management will be the national and local government agencies    that need tax revenues and sound budget policies; government employees; and,    finally, all entities with which the government is in arrears. All Kyrgyz citizens    would be indirect beneficiaries. Sound fiscal policies and management practices    contribute to both short- and long-term economic stability and make a significant    contribution toward the growth potential of the economy.      Key Results:  Three    key results are necessary to achieve this objective. (1) Taxes are more fairly    and broadly applied and enforced. (2) Government borrowing is less inflationary.    (3) The expenditure allocation process is rationalized.      Performance and Prospects:      Kyrgyzstans stabilization program has been tested by a combination of    factors over the past year. The country conducts a large amount of trade with    Russia and Kazakhstan; and, consequently, has been hit by the downturns in those    countries. In addition, the sharp drop in the price of gold has reduced revenues    from Kyrgyzstans main export earner. Inflation has risen from an annual rate    of less than 15% at the end of 1997 to 32% in the middle of 1999, while the    general government deficit remains close to 10% of GDP. The government has recently    implemented fiscal and monetary measures to combat these problems. Excise taxes    have been doubled on a number of goods, while governmental non-essential expenditures    have been cut. Interest rates have been raised. Nevertheless, the government    has been unable to cut expenditures sufficiently to offset declining tax revenues.    New revenue-enhancing measures are urgently needed.      Overall, USAIDs performance    in 1999 was satisfactory. The key indicator for this objective, the general    deficit as a percentage of GDP, was estimated to be on target in 1999 at 3%.    The government accomplished this by cutting expenditures on supplies by 8%.    USAID also helped the Government of Kyrgyzstan to reorganize the State Tax Inspectorate    along functional lines. The new structure will improve revenue collection, reduce    opportunities for corruption, and institute an appeals process.      The tax compliance rate of    11% did not meet USAIDs 1999 target (16%). However, given the very poor condition    of the Kyrgyz economy, and thus, the dropping tax revenues, the result was considered    a limited success.      In an effort to rationalize    expenditures, USAID successfully increased the number of government agencies    adopting program budgeting from seven in 1998 to 11 in 1999. Program budgeting    links spending to programs, and therefore provides the government with the ability    to evaluate the performance of programs, and to link performance to future funding.    USAID is building on this success during 2000 by evaluating and re-training    key staff members in program budgeting. A budget classification system still    needs to be put in place.      Recent changes within the    government bode well for accelerated fiscal reform in 2000 and 2001. For example,    the Chairman of the Central Bank has replaced the Minister of Finance. USAID    was successful in implementing successful reforms in bank accounting and supervision    under his tenure. Therefore, USAID expects to continue to make substantial progress    in fiscal reform. In addition, the government has placed the Customs Inspectorate    under the Ministry of Finance in order to consolidate revenue collection efforts.    Next year will be a critical year in the governments effort to increase tax    collections, as it will be the first full year of operation under a reorganized    administrative structure for the State Tax Inspectorate. Significant progress    is expected.  Possible Adjustments to    Plans:  The government has requested assistance in public-sector accounting,    which USAID plans to provide in 2000 and 2001. The conditions in Kyrgyzstan    are favorable for the development of such a project. The Minister of Finance    and his deputy were instrumental in the success of the bank accounting reform    project, and have expressed the need for a project in public-sector accounting.    Government accounting reform would complement work already being done under    this objective, and enhance the management of government finance.  Other Donor Programs:     During 1999, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) brought in an advisor to    work on tax policy issues. The IMF and USAID have been instrumental in preventing    legislation that would reduce tax revenues. The other donor in this area, the    German Agency for Technical Cooperation, phased out its assistance in December    1999.  Principal Contractors,    Grantees, and Implementing Agencies:  USAID activities are implemented through    KPMG/Barents, a U.S. contractor, and through the U.S. Department of the Treasury.    The Academy for Educational Development coordinates participant training.              Selected Performance Measures:                                                                        Baseline  (1995)                                Actual                (1998)                  Target                (1999)                  Target                (2000)                  Target                (2001)                                                                                            Government deficit as a percentage of GDP                                               12.5%               3%               3%               2.5%               2%                                                         Tax revenues as a percentage of GDP                            13.6%               10.7%               18%               19%               20%                                                         Govt. of Kyrgyzstan maintains compliance with conditions of international                  financial institutions*                                             Yes                            *               *               *               *                                  __           *During FY 1998, USAID programs were being    consolidated when the new strategy was developed.

U.S. Finance Table            ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM : Kyrgyzstan    TITLE AND NUMBER:     Accelerated Development and Growth of Private Enterprises, 116-013  PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING    SOURCE:  $6,850,000 FSA  PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUDNING    SOURCE:  $10,800,000 FSA  STATUS:  Continuing  INITIAL OBLIGATION : FY 1993    ESTIMATED    COMPLETION DATE : FY 2004  Summary:  The private    sector in Kyrgyzstan is in desperate need of continued assistance if it is to    have any hope of contributing to an increase in the standard of living. In 1995,    when USAID began this work, 40% of GDP was generated by private enterprise.    This percentage has since increased steadily to 68% in 1999. Unfortunately,    these efforts are confronted by the difficulty of attracting capital investment    in an emerging market with a difficult economic climate. During 1999, growth    continued to stagnate. Problems resulted from the low prices fetched for the    countrys commodity exports, especially gold and cotton. There was a major decline    late in the year in the value of the  som . It plummeted in value by 50%    in 1998 after two years of relative stability, and then again in early 1999    in response to the devaluation of the  tenge  in Kazakhstan. Finally, the    country continues to experience severe difficulties servicing both its internal    and external debts in 1999.      There have been a number    of positive developments. More than half of all land is in private hands with    99-year land use leases. Under a constitutional amendment adopted in October    1998, these land users will automatically become landowners. Agriculture accounts    for about half of the GDP. More than 80% of agricultural output is produced    on private farms. These should benefit from the liberating effects of land ownership.    Moreover, the President has just created a powerful new land agency, led by    a strong reformer, to oversee land reform.       The direct beneficiaries    of these activities will be the nations private sector, as well as government    entities that affect the private sector through laws and regulations. The indirect    beneficiaries will be all citizens, as well as Kyrgyzstans major trading partners.    USAID activities in this area support the U.S. Embassys Mission Performance    Plan to assist the Government of Kyrgyzstan in the transition to a free-market    economy.      Key Results:  Three    key results are necessary to achieve this objective: (1) an improved operating    environment for private sector growth; (2) improved human resources for a market    economy; and (3) increased availability and accessibility of capital and technological    resources for the private sector.      Performance and Prospects:     USAID advisors assisted Kyrgyzstan in becoming the first Central Asian country    to acquire full World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. USAID assisted in    analyzing the investment climate and existing, commercial laws; then drafting    additional laws and regulatory regimes. Post-WTO accession assistance continues,    as efforts are focused on streamlining the structure of the WTO oversight body;    thereby, ensuring that the government meets all reporting and notification requirements.    Commercial laws passed with USAID assistance include the Foreign Investment    Law, the Procurement Law, and the Bankruptcy Law; all of which helped strengthen    the investment climate. The FINCA micro-credit program has been very successful    and has achieved complete financial sustainability. Since program inception,    nearly $12 million in loans have been disbursed to 78,000 clients.  In the area of legal and    institutional reform, advisors have been working in key fields including trade    and investment, bankruptcy, collateral law, and the Civil Code. An important    product has been the publication of a  Practical Guide to the Civil Code,    Part 1 . This three-volume work, the first of its kind in the former Soviet    Union, explains the operation of the Civil Code in non-academic terms, through    real-life transactions. General business law has also been a focus, targeting    constraints to business, including inadequate implementation of laws in such    areas as contracts and property rights. Many of these efforts are needed to    maintain the momentum created by the privatization process and to expand opportunities    for U.S. trade and investment in Kyrgyzstan.   In 2001, support for private    enterprise reform will focus increasingly on institutional development, reforms,    and reductions of constraints to business. This will help in developing a local    business environment that is more open and transparent and therefore less susceptible    to corrupt practices. USAID is encouraging development and utilization of a    competitive and cost-efficient procurement system and is promoting the establishment    of a monitoring agency to encourage greater transparency and competition. Finally,    as part of the ""Southern Strategy,"" USAID continues to assist small and    medium enterprises in the Fergana Valley in sectors such as food processing,    construction, banking and credit unions, and textiles.  USAID advisors are helping    to address the issue of private land ownership. Private ownership of land was    provided for in a constitutional referendum adopted on October 17, 1998. USAID    advisors helped the government draft a package of implementing legislation,    including a Land Code and Mortgage Law. Thus, USAID has been instrumental in    assisting the government in making, in less than a year, more progress on modern    land legislation than has been made anywhere else in Eurasia.      In orderto reduce    constraints to business, USAID initiated a Regulatory Reform project in 2000.    USAID is preparing to end accounting reform assistance to the private sector.    USAID funding of the successful Foundation for International Community Assistance    (FINCA) micro-credit program will end. The program will become a commercial    enterprise. The International Finance Corporation has expressed interest in    investing in such a venture. USAID anticipates new activities in economic and    business education in 2000 and 2001.  Possible Adjustments to    Plans:  No strategic changes identified at this time.  Other Donor Programs:     Efforts to improve the business environment have been developed in close coordination    with other donors, especially the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction    and Development, and the Asian Development Bank. USAID is actively cooperating    with projects of Dutch, German and Swiss technical assistance, as well as the    European Union/Technical Assistance for Commonwealth of Independent States.  Principal Contractors,    Grantees, and Implementing Agencies:  USAID activities are implemented through    private U.S. firms such as Booz Allen & Hamilton, Associates in Rural Development/Checchi    and Carana Corporation, along with private voluntary organizations such as International    Executive Service Corps, FINCA, and Agricultural Cooperative Development International/Volunteers    in Overseas Cooperative Assistance. The Central Asian-American Enterprise Fund    makes capital available to the Kyrgyz private sector with a business loan program.    The Academy for Educational Development coordinates participant training.                                           Selected Performance Measures:                                                                        Baseline  (1995)                                Actual                (1998)                  Target                (1999)                  Target                (2000)                  Target                (2001)                                                          Share of GDP generated by private Enterprises                                                40%               *               *               *               *                                                                                           Number of new firms transferred to new accounting standards (cumulative)                              0               800               400               600               1000                                                         Govt. of Kyrgyzstan maintains adherence to conditionality of                  international financial institutions*                                              Yes                             *               *               *               *                                  *During FY 1998, USAID programs were being    consolidated and a new strategy was being developed.

U.S. Finance Table            ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM:  Kyrgyzstan    TITLE AND NUMBER:     A More Competitive and Market-Responsive Private Financial Sector, 116-014  STATUS:  Continuing      PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING    SOURCE:  $450,000 FSA  PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING    SOURCE:  $700,000 FSA  INITIAL OBLIGATION:  FY 1993    ESTIMATED    COMPLETION DATE:  FY 2001  Summary:  In Kyrgyzstan,    USAID seeks to create a more competitive and market-responsive private financial    sector by reforming the banking sector and by developing a vibrant securities    market. This program initially concentrated on strengthening the bank regulatory    authoritys ability to supervise commercial banks. USAID had made reasonable    progress in providing technical assistance for bank supervision when the Finnish    Government took on this area in 1997. USAID then was able to concentrate its    efforts on assisting commercial banks in converting to international accounting    standards. The Finnish banking supervision program proved limited and momentum    in moving bank supervision forward was lost. Thus, USAID has responded recently    to a Government of Kyrgyzstan request to restart assistance in developing a    professional bank supervision capacity.      USAID has been involved in    capital market development in Kyrgyzstan since mid-1994. This support has been    comprehensive and includes creating an independent National Securities Commission    (NSC), establishing the Kyrgyzstan Stock Exchange (KSE), restructuring investment    funds, and providing training to broker-dealers. Direct beneficiaries of this    work are the professionals involved in financial market development: private    bankers, stock brokers, and registered private enterprises. Indirect beneficiaries    include contributors to pension funds and the general public. They benefit by    more secure banks in which to deposit their savings and from the higher standards    of living that will eventually result, due to increased investment emanating    from those savings and pension contributions.      Key Results:  Two results    are necessary to achieve this objective. (1) Government regulatory agencies    supervise, administer, and enforce legislation. (2) More forms of financial    intermediation are institutionalized and effectively supply the private sector    on a competitive basis.      Performance and Prospects:     Kyrgyzstans banking system is fragile and under-capitalized, with 18 banks    combining a total share capital of less than $14 million. Five banks, including    the largest, were placed under conservatorship or liquidation in the first half    of 1999, and two more banks have since been placed under conservatorship. Several    had financial links to the state gas company, Kyrgyzgazmunaizat, which was affected    by a large-scale fraud in early 1999. The weak supervision capabilities of the    central bank were revealed by the failure to recognize and respond to this problem.    USAID has recently started to address these problems as part of an effort to    tighten financial regulatory guidelines and enhance monitoring capacity in the    banking sector. In response to a request from the Chairman of the Central Bank,    USAID recently placed a supervision specialist on site.       With USAIDs technical assistance,    all of Kyrgyzstans 18 commercial banks are now operating using international    accounting standards. The virtually complete adoption of such standards by the    banks is a critical component of transparency and represents a significant step    forward in reform.      In 1999, significant progress    was achieved in improving the prospects for sustainability of the stock market.    Off-exchange trading was prohibited, leading to increased trading volume. The    basic framework for an effective securities market has been developed, although    the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange requires increased corporate listings and the development    of a cost-efficient over-the-counter (OTC) system. USAID assistance to the stock    market will terminate in early 2000.  USAID's primary function    will be technical assistance to improve bank supervision. This will include    some assistance to the banking sector that focuses on transparency issues, and    training accountants from the central bank and commercial banks to better understand    international accounting standards. In addition, the banks will be provided    with technical assistance for the development of better information systems.      Possible Adjustments to    Plans:  It is expected that the bank accounting reform activities will end    in 2000. Work on bank supervision will have a longer time horizon.      Other Donor Programs:     USAID assistance is coordinated closely with the World Bank, as well as with    other donors, particularly the European Union. The International Monetary Fund    is currently supporting an advisor in bank supervision (off-site), thereby complementing    USAIDs assistance.  Principal Contractors,    Grantees, and Implementing Agencies:  USAID financial assistance activities    are implemented through two private U.S. firms, Pragma and International Business    & Technical Consultants, Inc. The Academy for Educational Development coordinates    participant training.

U.S. Finance Table            ACTIVITY DATA SHEET      PROGRAM : Kyrgyzstan    TITLE AND NUMBER:     Increased Citizens' Participation in Political and Economic Decision-making,    116-021  PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION    AND FUNDING SOURCE:  $2,500,000 FSA  PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION    AND FUNDING SOURCE:  $3,000,000 FSA  STATUS:  Continuing  INITIAL OBLIGATION:     FY1993     ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:  FY 2004      Summary:  Kyrgyzstan    is an emerging democracy and the only country in the region where there is considerable    support for reform. Citizens are increasingly becoming more informed and are    participating in political and economic decision-making at all levels. However,    the process for democratization has yet to become institutionalized. For example,    elections do not yet fully meet international standards, NGOs and independent    media are still not sustainable, and NGO-government partnerships are nascent.    Formal public parliamentary hearings are held on an  ad hoc  basis. The    purpose of USAIDs effort is to address these issues of institutionalization    and long-term sustainability of democratic reforms and in this, the activities    support the U.S. Embassy's Mission Performance Plan. The direct beneficiaries    of the activities in this area are the members and leaders of the NGOs and independent    media. Indirectly, all citizens will benefit from a strengthened civil society    which permits free and open participation in elections.       Open, competitive elections    are integral to the long-term sustainability of citizen participation. USAID    is devoting attention to the upcoming 1999-2000 elections cycle. USAID assistance    aims to increase citizen participation in the electoral process and to help    the government comply with its commitments to international electoral standards.    Additional priorities are the creation of a legal infrastructure to expand existing    government accountability, and the fortification of NGO and media development    to promote well-informed citizen participation. Assistance to the NGO community    aims to increase its professional and management capabilities, to encourage    advocacy and lobbying, to influence legal and regulatory processes, to effect    social change, and to provide needed social services.       USAIDs program includes    a strong emphasis on building social partnerships between civil society, government,    and the business sector to further foster citizen participation in decision-making.    USAID is working to make public hearings a part of the formal legislative process    and to cultivate government receptivity toward citizen participation.       Key Results:  Three    key results are necessary to promote civic participation: 1) NGO roles in civil    society must be augmented; 2) information on domestic economic policies and    politics must become readily available; and 3) the government must become more    responsive and accountable to citizens and citizens organizations.       Performance and Prospects:     Progress has exceeded expectations. However, the Ministry of Justice is    not allowing several political parties to participate in the upcoming parliamentary    elections. This matter is currently before the courts. In addition, there are    reports that some media outlets are under government pressure to cease programming    related to the election campaign. The upcoming election campaign and the elections    themselves will be a true test of Kyrgyzstans commitment to democratic processes.          Despite these issues, the    Government of Kyrgyzstan adopted a new electoral code that, for the most part,    meets international standards for elections as outlined in the Organizations    for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Copenhagen Document. USAID assistance    played an integral role in helping the government draft the legislation and    include ideas from the NGO and media communities. NGOs continue to grow and    expand their advocacy activities. For example, the Coalition for Democracy,    an USAID-supported leading democracy-related coalition of NGOs, expanded its    activities this election cycle and established branch offices in each of the    oblasts in Kyrgyzstan. The Parliament is increasingly viewing NGO and citizen    input as an important part of the legislative process. Several active journalist    associations in Kyrgyzstan have also participated in reviewing draft legislation    and submitting commentary to Parliament. With USAID assistance, a new legislative    drafting center now provides the Parliament greatly needed drafting services.    With respect to media, broadcast journalists increasingly engage in more politically    sensitive reporting. Until recently, only print journalists produced hard-hitting    political news.   In FY 2001, USAID is anticipating    additional programming in the area of womens legal rights issues, womens participation    in political processes, and youth social activism at the local level.  Possible Adjustments to    Plans:  No strategic changes identified at this time.  Other Donor Programs:     Civil society development is a multi-donor effort in Kyrgyzstan. The United    Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), OSCE, United Nations Development    Program (UNDP) and Soros all support local NGOs with small grants. The UNHCR    is co-funding NGO resource centers along with USAID. In the area of independent    media, the UNDP, OSCE and Soros support journalist associations and conferences.    In the political processes area, UNDP is implementing an ""automization"" of elections.    USAID and the European Union coordinate with parliamentary assistance.       Principal Contractors,    Grantees, Implementing Agencies:  Several USAID-funded U.S., private voluntary    organizations such as the American Bar Association/Central and East Europe Law    Institute, Internews, the National Democratic Institute, and the International    Foundation for Electoral Systems are playing a role in promoting democracy in    Kyrgyzstan. Counterpart International Aid to Artisans, and the International    Center for Not-for-profit Law, together form the Counterpart Consortium, also    participate in local NGO development.

The nation can no longer maintain its infrastructure or administer social services    adequately now that these are no longer subsidized the Union of Soviet Socialist    Republics. On the other hand, modest democratic reforms have taken root in ""self-governing    cities,"" in which the President appoints a mayor from among the popularly    elected council members. This system increases accountability since these mayors    are local leaders with a local reputation to maintain. A promising development    this past year is that the Congress of Local Communities, a government-sponsored    NGO, is an advocate for decentralization and for the professionalization of    local government.       Local government reform has    the potential to improve the quality of everyday life for citizens, to increase    local control over local issues, and to involve the population more actively    in public affairs. Local government assistance can serve as a platform for USAID    or other agencies objectives. Improved water supply, greater civil society,    and economic development are areas which would benefit from more effective and    responsive local governments. The direct beneficiaries of the activities in    local municipal reform are the citizens of the municipalities who will receive    improved services from their local government.      Assistance under this objective    is critical for laying the groundwork for reform by strengthening the institutional    capacity of selected municipal governments, and by cultivating advocates for    local government reform within the sector. The demonstration effect of the models    inspire other local governments to adopt improved practices, as well as encourage    the national government to devolve greater authority to self-governing bodies.      Key Results:  The three    results are to 1) increase citizen participation, 2) to strengthen local governments    capacity, and 3) to increase the autonomy of local government from national    and oblast authority.       Performance and Prospects:     During this first year many activities were begun under the Local Government    Initiative. The highlights in 1999 included: the first public budget hearing    ever, held in Naryn; the rapid formation of democratically organized housing    associations throughout the country; and the appointment and training of procurement    agents nationwide. Successful model practices included a model procurement in    Bishkek and competition among the best housing associations for grants that    built in competitive procurement practices. Well-received, on-going activities    include support to local organizers to form democratically controlled housing    associations to perform functions previously performed by government agencies,    leadership skills, financial management and procurement training for officials    and council members, and the automation of financial management systems in the    rayon of Chuy-Tokmok. A change in contractors slowed implementation in the fall    of 1999. However, the new firm retained most of the local staff and, after a    culling process, the most promising activities are being pursued further.      An enormous agenda remains    in the area of local government empowerment. Villages, towns, and cities are    severely constrained by the Finance Ministry's control over their budgets. The    tax law allows local authorities to collect a number of local taxes and fees,    but these sources provide only a fraction of the required local revenues. Despite    the reforms being implemented by national agencies, much remains to be done,    including involving the Ministry of Finance, which remains an opponent of fiscal    decentralization. USAID will continue to address these issues through policy    dialogue with the national government.       The 2000 work plans will    build on current activities, as well as expand the development and implementation    of model ""good practices"" in up to four local governments.       Possible Adjustments to    Plans:  No change in strategic plans identified at this time.      Other Donor Programs:     A number of other donors including the World Bank, UNDP, and the European Union    also support activities with a local government dimension that build around    the principles of promoting sustainable human development in the country through    decentralized management and a professional civil service.

The health care delivery system which Kyrgyzstan    inherited from the soviet era can be characterized as an inverted pyramid. Primary    care is at the bottom, with too few resources, while specialized hospital care    at the top receives too much. One of the major problems is the inefficient allocation    of existing resources and nonexistent infrastructure for primary health care.          In 1994, USAID initiated    health care reform assistance to restructure the health-care system. The government    has been a leader in health reform, introducing an integrated package of reforms    at a rapid pace, especially in the pilot activity in Issyk-Kul. The success    of USAIDs assistance helped to leverage a World Bank loan to replicate the    reforms more broadly. With combined USAID and World Bank efforts, approximately    90% of Kyrgyzstans population will have access to primary health care services    by the year 2002. The newly created Family Group Practices (FGPs) will be the    first points of contact for the population at the local level. All citizens    of Kyrgyzstan are beneficiaries of this reform.      Key Results:  This    activity contributes to the improved sustainability of selected social services    through achievement of two results: 1) cost-effective health care services will    be demonstrated in selected oblasts, and 2) cost-effective health sector reforms    adopted nationally. To date, 329 FGPs are operational nationally. 87% of the    people have openly enrolled and are exercising their choice for their FGP in    the pilot sites. The health care system is already more cost-effective, and    60% of the service providers in the pilot oblast are being reimbursed by market-oriented    payment systems. The Issyk-Kul model has now been adopted in five additional    Oblasts. NGOs have become an important vehicle for these reforms and will help    ensure that more effective delivery and change is taking place in target communities.      Performance and Prospects:     This activity has progressed well with a high proportion of the targeted populations    (85%) now exercising their right to select the family group practice of their    choice in areas where enrollment campaigns have been conducted. All management    information systems have been developed and implemented, allowing the providers    to respond to new incentive payment systems. A new provider payment system,    which encourages primary care physicians to treat more and refer less often    to specialty hospitals, is being implemented. USAID has also provided technical    assistance to integrate womens reproductive health, childhood health services,    and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis into (FGPs). All FGPs will provide    family planning services by 2001.       USAID policy and legal assistance    led to the establishment of a national framework for health care, which incorporates    health insurance into a broader social insurance context. Information on health    reform has been widely disseminated to the public through television and radio    spots and newspaper and magazine articles. The health insurance fund has implemented    nationwide the hospital payment system which was developed in the Issyk-Kul    demonstration. By FY 2004, it is expected that health reforms in Kyrgyzstan    will be completely institutionalized at the policy and program levels.       Possible Adjustments to    Plans:  Integration of vertical health programs (i.e., infectious diseases,    and reproductive health) into the Family Group Practice health delivery structure    will become institutionalized.  Other Donor Programs:     Various other donors are involved in this crucial area, including the World    Bank, the Asian Development Bank, World Health Organization, United Nations    Development Program, UNICEF, UNAIDS, United Nations Population Fund, and the    European Union.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in  room 2322, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Fred Upton  (chairman) presiding.     Members present: Representatives Upton, Stearns, Largent,  Shimkus, Pickering, Blunt, Terry, Markey, Green, McCarthy,  Luther, Harman, and Sawyer.     Staff present: Mike O'Rielly, majority professional staff;  Brendan Kelsay, minority counsel; and Yong Choe, legislative  clerk.     Mr. Upton. All right. We will start. Good morning. The  subcommittee will now come to order. Today's hearing is on the  Children's Internet Protection Act, otherwise known as ``CIPA''  or ``CHIPA.''     On April 20, CHIPA is to be implemented by the FCC, and  there have been several recent lawsuits filed in Federal Court  challenging the constitutionality of the law, and seeking to  block its implementation as it pertains to public libraries.     I support the goal of CHIPA. In my view, the taxpayers  should not be required to fund obscenity or child pornography,  or any means of accessing it. Nobody should be able to use  publicly funded library computers to access obscene pictures or  child pornography.     And libraries should be responsible for protecting children  from this material and other material which is harmful to them,  period. Under CHIPA, E-rate funding to public libraries and  schools will be conditioned upon their deployment of  technology, which will prevent children from accessing visual  depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or other visual  depictions that are otherwise harmful to minors.     Libraries and schools which do not comply will lose their  E-rate funding. Moreover, CHIPA requires schools and libraries  which receive E-rate funding to adopt and implement broad  Internet safety policies, which should address access by minors  to inappropriate matter on the Internet.     The safety and security of minors when using E-mail and  chap rooms, hacking by minors, unauthorized disclosure of  personal and identifying information regarding minors, and  measures designed to restrict minors' access to material that  is harmful to them.     As the parent of two young kids who use the Internet, I  know well the wonderful educational opportunities which the  Internet brings to them. However, I also know the fear that all  parents have about their kids being unwittingly exposed to smut  on the Internet, particularly when parents may not be around,  like at the library and at the school.     Primarily at issue in today's hearing is the use of the  Internet in public libraries. Our public libraries are among  our communities most valuable assets. Unlike movie theaters and  video arcades, public libraries are supposed to be where  parents can send their kids to learn in an environment where  they have access to only safe and appropriate materials.     By and large I believe that our Nation's libraries take  very seriously their responsibilities to protect kids. For  example, I recently visited the Kalamazoo Public Library in my  district, and I know that they have a terrific computer  facility, complete with Internet access.     Through a system of user identification cards, acceptable  use rules, and computer screens which are all in one place,  where they can be seen by an effective monitoring staff, there  are very few incidents of inappropriate material being accessed  by library users.     Those limited few who break the rules get caught and get  their privileges yanked. The system as I have watched it, I  know is working well in Kalamazoo. Nevertheless, CHIPA is the  law, and the practical question is whether filtering and  blocking technologies are able to provide an optimal level of  protection for all of our Nation's public libraries,  particularly where library systems and staff monitors are not  as effective as they certainly are in Kalamazoo.     Among others, the ACLU and the American Library Association  have filed suit in Federal Court challenging the  constitutionality of the law as it pertains to libraries. I am  not a lawyer and so I won't venture a guess as to how the court  might come down.     However, as a parent, and a taxpayer, and a believer in  public libraries, and a supporter of the E-rate system which  helps them provide computers and Internet access to those who  might not otherwise have it, I believe we need to better  understand the legal and practical arguments on both sides of  the litigation, not to mention the promises and shortcomings  that filtering and blocking technologies represent at this  time.     I look forward to hearing from today's panel of witnesses.  I appreciate their willingness to help us to get to the bottom  of the matter, and I appreciate them being on time. I would  note that we have a number of subcommittees that are also  meeting on this day at this time, and I would ask for unanimous  consent that all Member's statements be included as part of the  record in their entirety.     [The prepared statement of Hon. Fred Upton follows:]    Prepared Statement of Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Subcommittee on                    Telecommunications and the Internet     Good morning.

I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses, and I appreciate  their willingness to help us get to the bottom of this matter.      Mr. Upton. Without objection, I represent my friend and  colleague from California, Ms. Harman, for an opening  statement.     Ms. Harman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am proud to be on  time, and I am also pleased that you are having this hearing,  because I think that this is a difficult and important subject  for us to address. I should tell the panel and this  Subcommittee that several Congresses ago I voted for the V- Chip.     I voted for the V-Chip because as a parent of four children  myself, an overworked parent of four children myself--and that  probably applies to most of the people about to testify, and to  you, too, Mr. Chairman--I wanted to have technology that  enabled me as a parent to make better choices for my minor  children.     That's why I voted for the V-Chip, and I think that is the  opportunity the V-Chip gives us. On the other hand, I did not  serve in the last Congress, and so I believe I have never voted  on CHIPA. I know that I didn't in the last Congress, but I  don't think it came up in any other form before that.     I may be wrong, but at any rate, I would have had more  doubts about CHIPA than I did about the V-Chip. I would doubt  both its constitutionality and its wisdom. As for its contrast  with the V-Chip, the V-Chip gives parents choice. CHIPA does  not.     CHIPA mandates. It is a government mandate that librarians  must do things or forego Federal funds. That is not giving  parents choice. That is the government choosing. So in that  sense, there is a contrast.     Second, in constitutional terms, I think as many are  arguing about the Campaign Finance Reform Bill that there are  serious issues when the government decides what expression will  be permitted, and what expression won't be permitted. So I  think there are constitutional issues there.     I would note further that it is not just the ACLU that is  suing. As much respect as I have for the ACLU, and I do, it is  also the American Library Association that is bringing suit  here because I know that librarians--I have heard from many in  my district--have serious concerns again about the government  telling them how to handle minor access to pornographic  materials in their libraries.     My conclusion, at least at the start of this hearing, is  that there are serious constitutional issues here that  government should be more careful, I believe, in striking the  balance that we need to strike, and that my goal is to give  parents choice about what their minor children view on the net,  and in local parentis to give librarians who serve local  communities choice about how to administer the Internet sites  that our children are seeing in the public libraries.     So I approach this material in a dubious fashion. I am very  interested to see what our witnesses say. I share your goal,  Mr. Chairman, that we as parents, and that we as  representatives of our districts, should do everything that we  can to provide tools for responsible adults to help our  children make wise choices.     But I am not sure that those tools should be mandated by  government. Thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my  time.     Mr. Upton. Thank you. I would note that I was also a  supporter of the V-Chip on the House floor several years ago,  and the CHIPA amendment as I understand it, we never had a  separate vote on that, either in Committee or on the House  floor.     It was rolled in as part of the Labor-HHS Appropriation  Bill and signed by President Clinton last year.     I recognize for an opening statement Mr. Blunt from  Missouri.     Mr. Blunt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for  having this hearing. This is an issue, like you and Ms. Harman,  that I feel that there are certainly some good points on both  sides of this issue. We need to be sure that we don't either  solve the wrong problem, or come up with the wrong solution, or  create a bigger problem than we solve here.     But I think that is the reason that we have these hearings.  This is not the final--for our witnesses, this is not the final  committee action on a bill. This is truly having an opportunity  to ask questions and get information a topic that we all have  concerns on, and that we all want to see is solved in the right  way.     And we respect the individuals here who have different  points of view on the way that we need to address this as a  Committee, and as a Congress, and I look forward to being part  of the hearing, and reading the transcript on the hearing if I  am not able to stay for all of it. So thank you, Mr. Chairman,  for having this hearing today.     Mr. Upton. Mr. Sawyer from Ohio.     Mr. Sawyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would associate  myself with the comments of my colleagues. Thank you for having  this hearing. We are on the threshold of a time when libraries  and schools are changing their role in a way that we elevate  the skill level of an entire Nation, and expose Americans to a  breath in the world that is just breathtaking.     Making sure that we do that in a way that does not stand in  the way of that access is enormously important, and with that,  I will yield back the balance of my time, and look forward to  the comments of our witnesses.     Mr. Upton. Well, thank you. Our panel today includes Mr.  Bruce Taylor, President and Chief Counsel of the National Law  Center for Children and Families; Mr. Marvin Johnson,  Legislative Counsel, of the American Civil Liberties Union,  ACLU; Ms. Laura Morgan, a Librarian, from the Chicago Public  Library; Ms. Carolyn Caywood, a Librarian from the Virginia  Beach Public Library, Bayside Area Library; Ms. Susan Getgood,  Vice President of the Education Market SurfControl; and Mr.  Chris Ophus, President of FamilyConnect, Inc.     I appreciate all of you getting your statements, which are  made part of the record in their entirety, in advance. And  since the vote has not started as the Cloakroom promised, we  will start with Mr. Taylor's testimony.     We are going to have a clock on you up here for about 5  minutes. So you will notice these little lights and buzzers,  and everything else. You have got 5 minutes to proceed, and all  of your statements are made as part of the record in their  entirety.     Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the  Committee. The National Law Center----     Mr. Upton. Since the vote has started, we are going to have  to break this up anyway, I think we may adjourn. Is this going  to be one vote or two?     Mr. Blunt. I do not know.     Mr. Upton. Is it going to be two votes? My guess is that it  is going to be two. Well, at this point, since Mr. Pickering  came, we will allow Mr. Pickering, who is one of the architects  in the CHIPA bill, to make an opening statement.     At that point, we will adjourn for about 15 minutes, and I  will do my best to round up some Members to come back and we  will start with you, Mr. Taylor, if that is okay. Maybe Mr.  Luther has an opening statement as well. Mr. Pickering.     Mr. Pickering. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to thank you  for holding this hearing. I look forward to hearing from the  panel as we ask questions and as we see CHIPA, the Children's  Internet Protection Act, implemented, and it is soon to be  implemented.     And hopefully we can find some common ground, but if not,  hopefully we can establish the record that this is a common  sense, mainstream, constitutional way to protect our children  from child predators, from obscenity, from child pornography,  that which is already illegal.     We believe that the language and the legislation was very  well crafted, taking lessons from recent communications efforts  to restrict this type of material, but that was ruled  unconstitutional in the Courts.     We believe that we avoided those pitfalls and those  problems by the way that we crafted the language. This is an  issue of funding, and it is an issue of child safety. And just  as we give incentives to States to have alcohol blood limits,  or seat belt restraints, for the safety of the public, we  believe that for the safety of our children, as well as  preventing that which is illegal--child pornography and  obscenity--from having access through our schools, and through  our libraries with Federal subsidies.     And we believe that this is a very mainstream, common  sense, approach, and that the agenda of the other side who  opposes is out of the mainstream, and it is extreme. It would  put our children at risk. So I look forward to the testimony  today and the questions as we establish a record in this  regard.     [The prepared statement of Hon. Chip Pickering follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Chip Pickering, a Representative in Congress                       from the State of Mississippi     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your holding this hearing today. I  believe you have given us the opportunity to expose the myths and  distortions of this legislation that it has been subjected to by its  opponents.     Throughout this hearing today we will hear several common arguments  by those who support federally funded access to child pornography and  obscenity, and let there be no mistake that this is the bottom line in  this debate.     Opponents of CIPA have made 5 basic arguments and I would like to  take a minute to refute their charges.     1. CIPA is constitutional because the conditions imposed on public  libraries for receiving federal funds for Internet access are  ``reasonably calculated to promote the general welfare'' and are  ``related to a national concern.'' Congress has the authority and  responsibility to ensure that federal funds are not used by government  agencies (pubic schools and libraries) to provide access to pornography  that is illegal under federal law, i.e., obscenity (18 U.S.C.  Sec. Sec. 1462, 1465), child pornography (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252 et seq.)  and that which is illegal under most state laws, material harmful to  minors displayed or distributed to minors. CIPA also promotes the  national interest by encouraging advancements in software filtering  technology.     The Supreme Court upheld a federal regulation that directed the  Secretary of Transportation to withhold a percentage of otherwise  allocable federal highway funds from States ``in which the purchase or  public possession . . . of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is  less than 21 years of age is lawful.'' The Court held: ``Incident to  the spending power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of  federal funds. However, exercise of the power is subject to certain  restrictions, including that it must be in pursuit of ``the general  welfare.'' Sec. 158 is consistent with such restriction, since the  means chosen by Congress to address a dangerous situation--the  interstate problem resulting from the incentive, created by differing  state drinking ages, for young persons to combine drinking and  driving--were reasonably calculated to advance the general welfare.''  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).     CIPA does not require all public libraries and schools to use  filtering software, only those that accept particular federal funds for  Internet access. The government has no duty to fund access to illegal  pornography on the Internet, especially in government agencies (public  schools and libraries). In Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Town of  Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1256 (3rd Cir. 1992), the court, held: ``The  State, no less than a private owner of property, has the power to  preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is  lawfully dedicated.'' [Citing Perry Education Association v. Perry  Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37, 44 (1983)].     CIPA is not viewpoint discrimination; it has nothing to do with  disagreement with the speaker's view. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors  of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995). The Supreme Court has  consistently recognized that the government may allocate funding  according to criteria that would not be permissible in enacting a  direct regulation.     In National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 118 S. Ct. 2168  (1998), the Court held that, ``the Government may allocate competitive  funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct  regulation of speech or a criminal penalty at stake.'' Id. at 2179.  ``it is preposterous to equate the denial of taxpayer subsidy with  measures aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas.'' Regan v.  Taxation with Representation, 461 U.S. 540, 550 (1983). ``The  Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a  program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public  interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program.''  Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991).     2. CIPA advances legitimate local library decisions. CIPA permits  local library officials to determine which software filter they will  use, and to set their own Internet policy. Federal funds may be used to  cover costs of filtering. CIPA permits a public library official to  disable the filter for bona fide research or other legal use by an  adult. Local officials have the right to oversee the filtering  technology to make certain that it complies with CIPA and their policy.  CIPA will assist local libraries to avoid sexual harassment and hostile  work environment complaints caused by the presence of Internet  pornography, such as has occurred in the Minneapolis and Chicago public  libraries. ``A school library, no less than any other public library,  is a ``place dedicated to quiet, to knowledge, and to beauty.'' Brown  v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 142 (1966) (J. Fortas). It is inconsistent  with the purpose of a public library to provide a peep show open to  children and funded by Congress.     3. CIPA will assist parents in poor communities to protect their  children from pornography while permitting safe and rewarding Internet  access in public libraries. It is much more likely that most parents  will not permit their children to use unfiltered Internet access.  Furthermore, parents who are able to provide filtered Internet access  in their home will be able to protect their children, while poor  children, dependent upon library Internet access, will not have the  same protection. The true ``digital divide'' is between protected  children and unprotected children who are exposed to pornography and  pedophiles in libraries with unfiltered Internet access. In Ginsberg v.  New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), the Court recognized that parents have a  right to expect the government to aid them in protecting their children  from pornography: ``While the supervision of children's reading may  best be left to their parents, the knowledge that parental control or  guidance cannot always be provided and society's transcendent interest  in protecting the welfare of children justify reasonable regulation of  the sale of material to them. It is, therefore, altogether fitting and  proper for a state to include in a statute designed to regulate the  sale of pornography to children special standards, broader than those  embodied in legislation aimed at controlling dissemination of such  materials to adults.''     4. CIPA provides security--not a false sense of security. A library  should inform the public whether the Internet access provided is  filtered or unfiltered. If filtered, the library should also inform  users that filters are not 100 percent effective in blocking  pornography. Filters are like the safety equipment on cars, e.g., the  brakes, seat belts, and headlights. We do not require 100 percent  effectiveness by any safety equipment before we use it. While we  provide children with driver's education and adult supervision, we do  not permit children to drive cars without safety equipment and expect  them to navigate safely on roads without traffic controls, speed limits  and law enforcement officers.     In the past two years, use of software filtering by public  libraries has increased 121 percent. A survey published in School  Library Journal, April-May 2000, reveals that 90 percent of public  school librarians and public librarians are either ``very well'' or  ``somewhat well satisfied'' with filtering software. A February 2000  survey conducted by National Public Radio, the Kaiser Foundation and  the Kennedy School of Government revealed that 84 percent of Americans  are worried about children online accessing pornography. Seventy-five  percent want government to do something about it. Congress did so in  CIPA. Once again, I thank you for holding this hearing and look forward  to hearing from the witnesses.      Mr. Upton. Thank you. Mr. Luther, from Minnesota.     Mr. Luther. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I will submit my  opening statement for the record.     [Additional statements submitted for the record follow:]  Prepared Statement of Hon. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, Chairman, Committee                           on Energy and Commerce     I thank Subcommittee Chairman Upton for calling this hearing. This  is a timely hearing given the upcoming FCC final rules and the recently  filed court cases.     Today's hearing focuses on the Children's Internet Protection Act  (``CIPA'' or ``CHIPA'') that was enacted as part of the final spending  bill at the closing days of the 106th Congress. It is an effort to  address one of the downsides of the Internet--the availability of  obscene and illegal material over the Internet. For all of the benefits  of the Internet, and we know there are many, it is clear that some  depraved individuals are using the new technologies in harmful and  corrupting manner. CHIPA is designed as a condition on receiving  federal funds. This is unlike past attempts by Congress to address the  availability of such material, which enacted straight bans or imposed  access requirements.     I think most people agree that the Internet is an amazing  technological innovation. It has essentially created a whole new medium  for communicating and conducting business. We can see vast benefits of  the Internet almost everyday. The Internet has essentially turned  everyone and every computer into their own printing press. It has also  dramatically lowered the cost of doing business and reaching new  markets.     We, as policymakers, should ensure that we cause the Internet no  harm as it develops from its infancy to adulthood. We have an  obligation to shepherd the medium as it grows in age and maturity.  Recently, Internet stocks have behaved like a child going through the  terrible two's. While it seems rough now, this will pass and  experienced, well thought-out business plans can and will succeed in  the marketplace.     However, just because an activity is occurring over the Internet  does not necessarily mean that it is untouchable. Clearly, there is  also a dark side to the Internet. Some people are using the medium to  illegally transport material including child pornography and material  that is harmful to minors. This type of material is not protected by  the First Amendment and traffickers should be prosecuted. Last  Congress, we held a hearing on enforcement, or lack of enforcement,  efforts by the Department of Justice. I am hopeful that the new  Administration will actively pursue violators. I want to acknowledge  the leadership of Congressman Pickering and Congressman Largent on this  important matter.     In terms of CHIPA, while I understand the complaints filed by the  ALCU and the American Libraries Association, I think it best not to  comment on these court cases. CHIPA does include an accelerated court  review process of the law, including an automatic referral to the  Supreme Court. This should help minimize uncertainty for parents,  schools, libraries and others. I also note that the cases focus on the  funding restrictions on libraries contained in CHIPA and not the  restrictions on funding for schools. Let me repeat, the schools portion  of the E-rate program is not being challenged at this time. America's  schools should proceed with the process of preparing to comply with the  parameters of the law.     CHIPA also includes a provision requiring NTIA to conduct a study  of filtering and blocking technologies to determine whether they meet  the needs of educational institutions. The findings of this study are  not due for some time but I am hopeful that NTIA can provide a  preliminary report on its findings and recommendations. We could use a  clearer picture of the effectiveness of filtering or blocking  technologies.     Furthermore, America's libraries are clearly not doing enough.  Unsupervised Internet access has the potential to turn schools and  libraries into modern day pornography shops. Many libraries and  supporting communities have taken positive steps to protect the  education and community setting of their libraries. I commend these  libraries for having the foresight to understand the need to protect  its members, especially the children. I make the call to all libraries  to follow suit and address a prevalent problem, which accompanies the  low cost of Internet access.     Again, I thank the Subcommittee Chairman and look forward to the  testimony of the witnesses.                                  ______                                     Prepared Statement of Hon. Gene Green, a Representative in Congress                          from the State of Texas     Mr. Chairman: I want to commend you for holding this important  hearing today to get a better understanding of the of the recently  passed Children's Internet Protection Act (CHIP Act).     Last years decision by our colleague in the Senate to include this  legislation in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 was ill- timed and unwise.     This legislation was enacted without any significant hearings or  public input and has now placed our schools and public libraries in a  delicate legal position.     Once again Congress, in its rush to protect children from online  smut, has over regulated the issue.     Although I support the principles of the Chip Act as it applies to  schools. My support is based on the fact that is illegal under just  about any circumstances for a minor of any age to access any type of  pornographic material.     Schools can exercise a greater level of control over student  viewing habits because most of the students are minors.     Trying to regulate content available over the Internet to adults at  taxpayer funded public libraries once again sets up a new round of  litigation covering the First Amendment.     In addition, it forces librarians into the role of judging what  material is simply pornographic and what is obscene.     Although I do not differentiate between pornographic and obscene  material, I think it is all disgusting, clearly the courts do see a  difference.     Under the CHIP Act schools and libraries who receive federal E-Rate  monies or Library Services Act funding face the daunting challenge of  trying to filter Internet sites for content..     Nowhere in the legislation did I see any funding increases to  schools or school districts to hire the additional technical personnel  needed to manage the Internet filtering or to fill out the new reports  required under the legislation.     Aside from the lack of funding, if the legislation had stuck to  schools and not libraries we may not be facing the current round of  litigation over whether the legislation violates the First Amendment.     I do not want children of any age to have access to pornographic or  obscene material whether at school or the library.     But when we start trying to regulate what adults can view at a  publically funded library, I question the wisdom of the legislation.     We are now asking our librarians to police the Internet and to make  subjective content decisions that only a court can determine.     On top of that, we have imposed what I consider draconian reporting  and compliance measures that will discourage use of the E-rate.     In reviewing the witness testimony, I can see a lot of the same  concerns being echoed by the panelists.     I was encouraged to see that Ms. Caywood has what appears to be a  compromise solution to this problem.     Breaking Internet access into layers of filtering, but retaining  computers that have no filtering software seems to me to be a workable  solution.     In addition, providing a physical privacy shield to the unfiltered  computers prevents anyone other than user from seeing the material  being viewed.     These steps do not limit free speech or place librarians in the  position of having to judge content.     Every time Congress tries to legislate morality, not matter how  worthy the issue, it seems we take it one step to far.     This legislation has strapped our schools and libraries with a huge  unfunded mandate and has made teachers and librarians cops of the  Internet.     I am sure this legislation is going to be litigated extensively,  but I am equally sure that the states will be coming to us to pay for  the related compliance and reporting requirements.     Mr. Chairman, I look forward to questioning the witnesses and I  yield back the balance of my time.      Mr. Upton. Okay. Since the vote is on, we will adjourn  until about 10:35 or 10:40.     [Brief recess]     Mr. Upton. We have about an hour until the next vote on the  floor. That will be two votes in a row. So at this point, we  will start with Mr. Johnson, and we will come back to Mr.  Taylor when he comes back. Mr. Johnson, welcome.   STATEMENT OF MARVIN J. JOHNSON, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL, AMERICAN                       CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION      Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, and  Members of the Committee, I thank you for this opportunity to  testify regarding the effectiveness of the Children's Internet  Protection Act or CHIPA.     CHIPA requires that public libraries and schools implement  mandatory blocking of obscenity, child pornography, and  material harmful to minors, in those facilities receiving  specified Federal funds.     CHIPA does not just block information for children,  however. It also blocks information for adults. Adults can only  get unblocked access if they ask for permission from a  librarian, and they convince the librarian that they have a  bona fide research purpose or other lawful purpose, whatever  that may mean.     Anyone who may want to research something that is going to  be sensitive--for instance, health information--may be deterred  from seeking this permission, or they will be forced to lie.  The end result is a dummying down of the Internet and the  information available through the Internet in public libraries.     Now, we all want to protect our children. However, in doing  so, we have to be careful not to throw out the baby with the  bathwater. Unfortunately, CHIPA not only throws out the baby  and the bathwater, but it throws out the bathtub and the house  as well.     CHIPA makes about as much sense as a law requiring a  stranger to randomly pull books off shelves and refuse to tell  librarians or patrons which books are gone. CHIPA is anomalous  given the fact that Congress appointed a panel of experts to  study ways to protect children on the Internet, and then  pointedly ignore those findings in enacting CHIPA.     In October 1998, Congress appointed the Child On-Line  Protection Act Commission, or COPA Commission, and charged it  with identifying technological or other methods that would help  reduce access by minors to materials that is harmful to minors  on the Internet.     In October of 2000, the Commission reported that blocking  technology raises First Amendment Concerns because of its  potential to be over-inclusive in blocking content, concerns  are increased because the extent of blocking is often unclear  and not disclosed, and may not be based on parental choices.     The Commission specifically did not recommend any mandatory  blocking technologies. Congress, nonetheless, chose to ignore  those recommendations and they adopted CHIPA. Now, CHIPA is  destined to be ineffective when it is implemented because  technology protection measures do not work.     First of all, there is just too much information available  to be able to index it and retrieve it. The web is estimated to  have over 1.5 billion pages, and by the end of 2001, to have  between 3 to 5 billion pages of information available.     They grow at a rate of approximately 200 million pages, or  2 million pages, excuse me, per day. The sheer amount of  information and the fact that that information constantly  changes makes it impossible to review and index all of that  information.     Second, the problem is under-blocking, and under-blocking  means that it does not block all of the so-called objectionable  material that it is intended to block.     For example, one software package was tested for under- blocking, and hundreds of pornographic websites were not  blocked by the software.     Examples included 069Palace.com. HotAsianFoxes.com, and  Organism.com. Blocking therefore just provides a false sense of  security for parents who believe that their children are being  protected when in fact they are not.     The third problem with blocking is that it over-blocks, and  that means that it blocks information that is not  objectionable. Last year during the election cycle, numerous  political websites were blocked, including Representative Lloyd  Dockett of Texas; Representative Jim Ryan of Kansas; and House  Majority Leader Dick Armey.     From this subcommittee, Ranking Member Markey found his  site blocked because it was characterized as hate, illegal  pornography, and/or violence. In March of this year, Consumer  Reports found that the blocking software is generally  ineffective, both because of the under-blocking and the  overblocking.     The fourth reason is that technology is inexact, and so  what it leads to is a significant constitutional problem  because of both the under and the overblocking. Thus, not only  will this technology not work, but the Act will be stricken as  unconstitutional.     There are less restrictive ways for Congress and libraries,  and particularly libraries, to be able to protect children when  they use the Internet, and many libraries are using these now.     For example, one is to use library web pages. They have  their own web pages where they have reviewed the information,  and they review the accuracy and adequacy of that information,  and then they put that on their web pages, and that helps guide  people away from possibly objectionable material.     And it makes sure that they get the best information  possible on the Internet. Second, educational programs also are  useful to educate parents and children, and last, Internet use  policies are also useful as well. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman,  we can find ways to protect our kids and honor the Constitution  at the same time. We don't cherish our children by destroying  the First Amendment Rights that are their legacy.     [The prepared statement of Marvin J. Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Marvin J. Johnson, Legislative Counsel, American                           Civil Liberties Union     Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee: I am Marvin J. Johnson,  Legislative Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.     I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today about the  Children's Internet Protection Act (CHIPA) on behalf of the American  Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU is a nation-wide, non-partisan  organization of more than 275,000 members devoted to protecting the  principles of freedom set forth in the Bill of Rights and the  Constitution.     The hearing today is to determine the effectiveness of the  Children's Internet Protection Act. CHIPA was signed into law on  December 21, 2000. It will become effective on April 20, 2001.  Sec. 1712(b) (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134); Sec. 1721(h) (to  be codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)). CHIPA requires that public  libraries receiving e-rate discounts or funds under the Library  Services Technology Act (LSTA) implement and enforce technology  protection measures to block obscenity, child pornography and material  harmful to minors.     Under the e-rate provisions, libraries that do not timely certify  their compliance become ineligible for further e-rate discounts. Where  the library knowingly fails to insure compliance, it may be required to  reimburse any discounts received for the period covered by the  certification. Libraries receiving LSTA funds are not required to  reimburse the government in the event they fail to comply with CHIPA.     CHIPA's restrictions are not limited to library Internet access  supported only by the federal e-rate and LSTA programs. Both the e-rate  restrictions in Section 1721(b) and the LSTA restrictions in Section  1712 require libraries to certify that technology protection measures  are in place on ``any of its computers with Internet access'' and  ``during any use of such computers.'' Sec. 1721(b) (to be codified at  47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(C)(i)-(ii)); Sec. 1712.15 (to be codified at  20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(1)(B)(i)-(ii)) [Emphasis added]. A library  subject to CHIPA must install and enforce the operation of technology  protection measures on all of its computers with Internet access even  if the library purchased the computers or paid for Internet access with  money that is not from federal programs.     While CHIPA is not yet in effect, it will be ineffective. There is  no reliable way to block out all objectionable material, so any  technological protection measure will be ineffective in removing that  material from view. Furthermore, all of the current technological  protection measures block significant amounts of material that deserve  constitutional protection. This overbreadth is one of the reasons CHIPA  is unconstitutional.                technology protection measures do not work     CHIPA will be ineffective because no available technology can  implement its mandate.     CHIPA defines a ``technology protection measure'' as ``a specific  technology that blocks or filters Internet access to the material  covered by a certification.'' 57 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(H). CHIPA  requires blocking of material that is obscene, child pornography, or  harmful to minors. It is not possible to create a technology protection  measure that blocks access only to material that is ``obscene,''  ``child pornography,'' or ``harmful to minors'' as defined by CHIPA, or  that blocks access to all material that meets those definitions.     In order to understand the reason these technological protection  measures are destined to fail, one must understand the nature of the  technology.     The World Wide Web is now estimated to contain over 1.5 billion  pages. It continues to grow and change at a geometric rate. Thus, there  is a massive amount of information to catalog, and that information  continues to change and grow every day.     Private companies produce technology that is designed to block  access to particular content on the web. The technology is commonly  referred to as ``blocking software'' or ``blocking programs.'' These  programs are computer software that is designed to block content on the  Internet that would otherwise be available to all Internet users.     Vendors of this software establish criteria to identify specific  categories of speech on the Internet. They then configure the software  to block web pages containing those categories of speech. Some programs  block as few as six categories, while others block up to twenty-nine or  more categories. These categories may include hate speech, criminal  activity, sexually explicit speech, ``adult'' speech, violent speech or  speech using specific disfavored words. Some of the blocked categories  express disapproval of a particular viewpoint, such as a category that  blocks all information about ``alternative'' lifestyles including  homosexuality.     The terms ``obscenity,'' ``child pornography'' and ``harmful to  minors'' as used in CHIPA are legal terms. None of the current vendors  of blocking technology claim to block categories that meet these legal  definitions, nor do they employ attorneys or judges to make those  determinations. Leaving decisions of what constitutes obscenity, child  pornography and material harmful to minors up to legally untrained  persons leads to more information being blocked than is legally  permissible.     Once blocking program vendors establish the criteria for  information they intend to block, they establish a method of  identifying the web pages that meet that criteria. Generally, they  conduct automated searches based on words or strings of words, similar  to searches done by standard search engines. Web pages are usually  blocked in their entirety if any content on the web page fits the  vendors' content categories, regardless of whether the content on the  page is textual, visual, or both.     No technology currently available allows vendors to conduct  automated searches for visual images that fit their content categories,  or that are communicated through email, chat, or online discussion  groups. As a result, any implementation of this technology is under- inclusive, allowing access to material that CHIPA intends to block.     After using this technology to identify web sites to block, the  blocking program vendors add these pages to a master list of web pages  to block (``blocked sites list''). Some vendors claim to have employees  review individual web sites before adding them to the blocked site  list. These employees, however, are not lawyers or judges, and receive  no legal training. There is a great deal of employee turnover in these  jobs. As a result, untrained employees are making what are essentially  legal decisions and excluding constitutionally protected material.     An operational blocking program then blocks users from accessing  web pages on the program's blocked sites list. Vendors normally treat  their blocked sites list as a trade secret, and refuse to reveal this  information to their customers, prospective customers, or to the  public.     Two blocking techniques can be used by program vendors to block  access to email, chat, and online discussion groups. First, the  blocking programs may block access to all email, chat, and online  discussion groups. Second, the programs may selectively block out  particular words communicated through email, chat, or discussion  groups. For example, the programs may replace supposedly objectionable  words with ``xxx'' regardless of the context in which the word was  used. Hence Marc Rotenberg's <SUP>1</SUP> blocked version of the First  Amendment: ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of  sXXXch, or the right of the people peaceably to XXXemble, and to  peXXXion the government for a redress of grievances.''     Because of the way these blocking programs work, they inherently  rely upon the exercise of subjective human judgment by the vendor to  decide what is objectionable and what is not. The vendor, rather than  librarians, other government officials, adult patrons, or parents  decide what gets placed on the ``blocked sites'' list.     Furthermore, because of the massive amounts of information  available on the web, and its constantly changing content, no company  can keep up with all the information or changes. It is estimated that  even the most sophisticated search techniques find less than 20% of the  web. Therefore, the idea that blocking technology will block out all of  the objectionable information on the web is an impossibility. Although  blocking program vendors provide updates to their blocked sites list,  it is impossible for them to find all of the content on the Internet  that meets their criteria, or to keep up with the rapidly increasing  and changing content available.     In March, 2001, Consumer Reports tested blocking software, and  found that most failed to block at least 20% of objectionable material.  Consumer Reports, March 1, 2001, ``Digital Chaperones for kids'' found  at http://www.consumerreports.org/Special/ConsumerInterest/Reports/ 0103fil0.html     Not only does blocking software fail to block all material meeting  the legal definitions of ``obscenity,'' ``child pornography'' and  material ``harmful to minors,'' it also blocks much material which is  not objectionable, and protected under the First Amendment. Because of  this overbreadth, CHIPA will be found unconstitutional, and therefore,  ineffective.     The federal government and others have repeatedly documented the  failures and flaws of blocking programs. The United States Attorney  General has said that blocking programs inescapably fail to block  objectionable speech because they are unable to screen for images.  Brief for the Appellants, Reno v. ACLU, No. 96-511 (January 1997) at  40-41. Congress itself has repeatedly noted these flaws. A House report  found that such software is ``not the preferred solution'' because of  the risk that ``protected, harmless, or innocent speech would be  accidentally or inappropriately blocked.'' H.R. Rep. No. 105-775 (1998)  at 19.     In October 1998, Congress appointed the Child Online Protection Act  Commission (``COPA Commission''), and charged it with ``identify[ing]  technological or other methods that will help reduce access by minors  to material that is harmful to minors on the Internet.'' In October  2000, the Commission reported that blocking ``technology raises First  Amendment concerns because of its potential to be over-inclusive in  blocking content. Concerns are increased because the extent of blocking  is often unclear and not disclosed, and may not be based on parental  choices.'' The Commission specifically did not recommend any  government-imposed mandatory use of blocking technologies.     On October 23, 2000, Peacefire <SUP>2</SUP> issued a report of  blocking technology which found error rates anywhere from 20% to 80%.  Error rates were based on sites being blocked as ``pornography'' when  they were, in fact, not pornographic. Study of Average Error Rates for  Censorware Programs, October 23, 2000, found at http:// www.peacefire.org/error-rates/     On November 7, 2000, Peacefire issued its report Blind Ballots: Web  Sites of U.S. Political Candidates Censored by Censorware. (http:// www.peacefire.org/blind-ballots/). The report found numerous political  candidates' sites were blocked by this software. Jeffery Pollock,  Republican candidate for Congress in Oregon's Third Congressional  District, had originally favored blocking software. After hearing that  his site was one of those blocked, he reversed his position. The site  of Congressman Markey, the Ranking Minority member of this subcommittee  was also blocked by one of the programs that characterized his site as  ``Hate, Illegal, Pornography, and/or Violence.''     Proponents of blocking often claim that even if some web sites are  blocked, there are others available on the topic that may be unblocked  so the information will ultimately be available. This position makes  little sense, particularly when discussing candidate web sites. Should  a Republican candidate be soothed by the fact that his blocked views  may be found and discussed at his Democratic opponent's unblocked web  site?     On December 12, 2000, Peacefire published a report demonstrating  that sites of human rights groups were being blocked by this software.  Amnesty Intercepted: Global human rights groups blocked by Web  censoring software, December 12, 2000, found at: http:// www.peacefire.org/amnesty-intercepted/     Consumer Reports in March 2001 found that blocking software varied  from 20% to 63% in its over-blocking.     Despite protestations from blocking software supporters that  instances of over-blocking are all ``old'' examples remedied by newer  versions, these examples are all recent. The flaws of blocking programs  are not a matter of individual flaws in individual products. These  flaws are inevitable given the task and the limitations of the  technology.     As a result of these problems, blocking software fails to protect  because it cannot block all material that meets the CHIPA criteria.  Furthermore, it blocks a huge amount of information that should not be  considered objectionable, and is clearly protected under the First  Amendment.              chipa restricts adult access as well as minors     While CHIPA purports to protect minors by blocking their access to  the Internet, it also blocks adult access. By sweeping so broadly,  CHIPA violates the Constitution.     Section 1721(b) of CHIPA requires public libraries that participate  in the federal e-rate program to certify to the FCC that they are ``(i)  enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a  technology protection measure with respect to computers with Internet  access that protects against access through such computers to visual  depictions that are (I) obscene; or (II) child pornography; and (ii) is  enforcing the operation of such technology measure during any use of  such computers.'' Sec. 1721 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254  (h)(6)(C)). [Emphasis added.]     Section 1712 of CHIPA applies to libraries that do not receive the  e-rate discount but receive funds pursuant to 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(b),  the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), ``to purchase computers  used to access the Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with  accessing the Internet.'' Sec. 1712 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C.  9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 requires the same installation and  enforcement of technology protection measures as is required by Section  1721(b). Sec. 1712 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) and (B)).     CHIPA's restrictions are not limited to library Internet access  supported only by the federal e-rate and LSTA programs. Both the e-rate  restrictions in Section 1721(b) and the LSTA restrictions in Section  1712 require libraries to certify that technology protection measures  are in place on ``any of its computers with Internet access'' and  ``during any use of such computers.'' Sec. 1721(b) (to be codified at  47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(h)(6)(C)(i)-(ii)); Sec. 1712.15 (to be codified at  20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(1)(B)(i)-(ii)) [Emphasis added].     Thus, while CHIPA is commonly referred to as a ``child protection  measure,'' it goes further and operates to block adult access as well.  In doing so, CHIPA will follow the CDA and COPA along the trail of  unconstitutional attempts to censor the Internet.               chipa further accentuates the digital divide     CHIPA will have little effect on the rich. They can afford their  own computers with unfiltered access. The poor who have to rely upon  library access to perform job searches, school homework, and general  research are the ones who will be penalized by CHIPA.     Public libraries play a crucial role in affording access to the  economic and social benefits of the Internet to those who do not have  computers at home. Libraries assure that advanced information services  are universally available to all segments of the American population on  an equitable basis.     For many people who cannot afford a personal computer or network  connections, Internet access at public libraries may be their only  means of accessing the Internet. Minorities, low-income persons, the  less educated, children of single-parent households, and persons who  reside in rural areas are less likely than others to have home Internet  access. For example, Whites are more likely to have access to the  Internet from home than Blacks or Latinos have from any location. Black  and Latino households are less than half as likely to have home  Internet access as White households. <SUP>3</SUP> According to the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, this  ``digital divide'' is growing. CHIPA will only worsen the situation  with these unintended consequences.            chipa overrides local control and decision-making     Many communities spent a lot of time studying the issue of Internet  access and how to deal with it in their public libraries. Kalamazoo,  Michigan, Holland, Michigan, and Multnomah County Public Library are a  few such examples. In each case, they decided blocking software was  inappropriate for their libraries, and they opted for other, less  restrictive measures to protect their children.     CHIPA ignores and overrides those local decisions, instead opting  for a ``one size fits all'' scheme that is unworkable and  unconstitutional.         chipa is unconstitutional because it limits free speech     CHIPA will further be ineffective to protect children because it  will be stricken as unconstitutional.     As you know, on March 20, 2001, the ACLU and the American Library  Association each filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of  Pennsylvania against the Children's Internet Protection Act (CHIPA).  Under the Act, any challenge will be heard by a panel of three judges,  and appeals from any decision of the panel will go directly to the  United States Supreme Court. The three judges were just recently  appointed. The First Amendment Applies to the Internet     In Reno I,<SUP>4</SUP> a unanimous Supreme Court held that the  First Amendment applies to the Internet. The Court found the Internet  should be afforded the highest protection under the First Amendment,  equivalent to that provided books, newspapers, and magazines.  <SUP>5</SUP> Therefore, any attempted regulation of Internet speech  such as CHIPA is constitutionally suspect. The First Amendment includes the right to receive information as well          as to speak.     While the First Amendment discusses the freedom of speech, the  Supreme Court has made it clear that it also encompasses the  fundamental right to receive information.<SUP>6</SUP> In Reno I, the  Supreme Court confirmed that the right to receive information applies  without qualification to expression on the Internet. <SUP>7</SUP> Thus,  attempts such as CHIPA to restrict information affect the  constitutional rights not only of the speaker, but the recipient as  well. For example, blocking a web site on safe sex violates the rights  of the web site operator (the speaker) but also the rights of the one  who wishes to review that material (the recipient). CHIPA Is a Content-Based Restriction on Speech That Fails the Strict          Scrutiny Test     CHIPA purports to restrict speech based on its content (obscenity,  child pornography, and material harmful to minors). Additionally, many  blocking software vendors block sites they find politically  objectionable, for example, sites that discuss or condemn  homosexuality. ``Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid.''  <SUP>8</SUP> In order to overcome the presumption of  unconstitutionality, content-based restrictions must meet the strict  scrutiny standard <SUP>9</SUP> and survive an exacting test. The strict  scrutiny test requires that the challenged statute or regulation is  necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest, and is narrowly  drawn to achieve that end. <SUP>10</SUP> ``It is not enough to show  that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully  tailored to achieve those ends.'' <SUP>11</SUP> Narrow Tailoring and Least Restrictive Means     Under the strict scrutiny analysis, the government has the burden  of establishing that a regulation is the least restrictive means and  narrowly tailored to its objective. <SUP>12</SUP> In other words, the  Government is not allowed to use a nuclear bomb when a small side arm  would suffice.     Government regulation of the Internet often fails because it  attempts to ``burn the house to roast the pig.'' <SUP>13</SUP> For  example, in Reno, the Court noted         ``[we] are persuaded that the CDA lacks the precision that the          First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the content          of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentially          harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount          of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive          and to address to one another. That burden on adult speech is          unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least          as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the          statute was enacted to serve.''     Because there were less restrictive alternatives available that  would be at least as effective as the CDA, the Court found the act  unconstitutional.     Like the CDA, CHIPA restricts far more speech than is targeted. As  noted above, no technology available today reliably blocks only  obscenity, child pornography and material harmful to minors. Thus, a  broad range of speech protected under the First Amendment gets  sidelined, while the filters also allow objectionable speech to get  through.     In passing CHIPA, Congress failed to consider less restrictive  alternatives. It also failed to heed the report of the COPA Commission  which did not recommend mandatory blocking programs, and recommended  various less restrictive alternatives. CHIPA Is Overbroad     Overbreadth is a test that is used when an otherwise legitimate  regulation also affects speech that may not be lawfully restricted.     An example of an overbroad statute appears in Reno I, where the  Court reviewed the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act  (CDA) <SUP>14</SUP>, Congress' first attempt to regulate content on the  Internet. In invalidating the CDA, the Court noted the act's breadth  was unprecedented, <SUP>15</SUP> and that it suppressed a large amount  of speech that adults have a constitutional right to send and receive.  Therefore, even though the intent may be to protect children, a law or  regulation that burdens speech which adults have a constitutional right  to receive is unconstitutional ``if less restrictive alternatives would  be at least as effective in achieving the Act's legitimate purposes.''  <SUP>16</SUP>     Because the effect of CHIPA is to suppress more speech than is  necessary to achieve the government's objective, it is fatally  overbroad. CHIPA Is An Unconstitutional Prior Restraint     Under the prior restraint doctrine, the government may not restrain  protected speech without the benefit of clear objective standards or  adequate procedural safeguards, including provisions for administrative  review, time limitations on the review process, and provisions for  prompt judicial review. <SUP>17</SUP>     CHIPA implicitly assumes, for example, that a blocking software  vendor can legitimately determine whether expression is unprotected by  the Constitution. From a legal standpoint, that assumption is  incorrect.     In 1973, the Supreme Court in Miller v. California,<SUP>18</SUP>  crafted the definition of obscenity still used today. Known as the  Miller test, it requires that a trier of fact (a judge or jury) examine  the work and determine:  1. Whether ``the average person, applying contemporary community          standards'' would find that the work taken as a whole, appeals          to the prurient interest; 2. Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way,          sexual conduct specifically defined in the applicable state          law; and 3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary,          artistic, political or scientific value. Only if the answer to all of these questions is ``yes'' can a work be  judged ``obscene'' and only then does it lose its protection under the  First Amendment.     In order to place certain speech into the category of obscenity,  the government must initially provide a series of procedural  safeguards. First, there must be a statute specifically defining the  sexual conduct that may not be depicted or displayed. This requirement  helps guarantee that speakers have fair notice of what is prohibited.  <SUP>19</SUP> Second, the material cannot legitimately be banned  without a full adversarial trial. Finally, a jury must be available to  apply the relevant ``community standards'' for obscenity to the  challenged material.     The fact that a school or library uses third-party software that  decides what is ``obscene'' material exacerbates the policy's  unconstitutionality. ``[A] defendant cannot avoid its constitutional  obligation by contracting out its decisionmaking to a private entity.''  <SUP>20</SUP>     Mandatory blocking policies that rely on commercial blocking  software constitute prior restraints because they ``entrust all . . .  blocking decisions . . . to a private vendor'' whose standards and  practices cannot be monitored by the blocking library. <SUP>21</SUP>  All substantive blocking decisions by commercial suppliers necessarily  lie outside the control of the government; consequently, each blocking  decision inherently lacks the requisite procedural safeguards. In fact,  in Mainstream Loudoun, the blocking software provider refused to  provide the defendants with the criteria it used to block sites, let  alone the names of the actual sites blocked. <SUP>22</SUP> Mandatory  blocking policies like CHIPA thus confer unbridled discretion on  commercial software providers, allowing them to restrict access  indiscriminately and without any administrative or judicial review.     In short, no speech is unprotected by the Constitution until a  court determines it to be so. CHIPA attempts to bypass legal  requirements and thus runs afoul of the Constitution. CHIPA Is Unconstitutionally Vague     It is a general principle of law that ``laws [must] give the person  of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is  prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.'' <SUP>23</SUP> If a law is  too vague to give this ``reasonable opportunity,'' it is deemed void  for vagueness. When a law interferes with the right of free speech, the  courts apply a more stringent variation of the vagueness test.  <SUP>24</SUP> The Supreme Court has recognized that First Amendment  ``freedoms are delicate and vulnerable, as well as supremely precious  in our society. The threat of sanctions may deter their exercise almost  as potently as the actual application of sanctions. Because First  Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may  regulate in the area only with narrow specificity.'' <SUP>25</SUP>     In order to avoid the vice of vagueness, the law or regulation  ``must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law  impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and  juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the  attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.''  <SUP>26</SUP> Therefore, the law must provide an ``ascertainable  standard for inclusion and exclusion.'' <SUP>27</SUP> When that  standard is missing, the law unconstitutionally produces a chilling  effect on speech, inducing speakers to ``steer far wider of the  unlawful zone'' than if the boundaries were clearly marked.  <SUP>28</SUP> It forces people to conform their speech to ``that which  is unquestionably safe.'' <SUP>29</SUP>     CHIPA provides that ``[a]n administrator, supervisor, or other  person authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disable the  technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to  enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose.'' No  definition of ``bona fide research or other lawful purpose'' is  provided. Sec. 1721 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254 (h)(6)(D)).  Section 1712 provides that ``[a]n administrator, supervisor, or other  authority may disable a technology protection measure . . . to enable  access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes.'' Sec. 1712 (to  be codified at 20 U.S.C. Sec. 9134(f)(3)). Unlike the comparable e-rate  section, this provision appears to apply to minors as well as adults.  Again, no definition is provided for ``bona fide research or other  lawful purpose.'' The phrase is left to the interpretation of each  librarian or staff person tasked with making that determination. CHIPA Violates Constitutionally Protected Anonymity and Privacy     CHIPA requires adults (and perhaps minors in the case of LSTA  funds) to seek permission from a government official in order to obtain  unblocked access. In doing so, a patron requesting such access loses  his or her anonymity and privacy. The Constitution protects anonymity  and privacy in communications and the ability to receive information  anonymously. <SUP>30</SUP> CHIPA Violates the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine     Broadly speaking, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine holds  that Congress may not condition receipt of federal funds upon the  waiver of a constitutional right. Under CHIPA, Congress conditions  receipt of federal money (except in the case of the e-rate) on the  condition that libraries violate the First Amendment.     During debates on the Children's Internet Protection Act (CHIPA),  some proponents claimed there was no constitutional infirmity in  conditioning receipt of federal money on acquiring and using blocking  software. Even if mandatory blocking itself violated the First  Amendment, it was claimed this was circumvented because schools and  libraries only had to block if they received federal funds. Since they  were under no obligation to receive those funds, there was no  violation.     The Supreme Court's decision in Legal Services Corporation v.  Velasquez <SUP>31</SUP> reaffirms the long-standing principle that the  government may not require the sacrifice of constitutional rights as a  condition for receiving a government benefit. <SUP>32</SUP> In  Velasquez, Congress required that funds distributed to the Legal  Services Corporation not be used to challenge existing welfare laws.  Legal Services attorneys therefore could not represent clients in  welfare benefits cases if the constitutionality of the welfare laws  became an issue. Thus, both the attorney and the client were prohibited  from challenging these laws; the attorney because of the funding  restrictions, and the client because they could not afford another  attorney. The Court thus had to decide ``whether one of the conditions  imposed by Congress on the use of LSC funds violates the First  Amendment rights of LSC grantees and their clients.'' The majority of  the Court concluded that it did.     While concluding that the government may, in certain circumstances,  use funding as a tool to mold speech, the Court noted `` `[i]t does not  follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the  [government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a  message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of  views from private speakers.' ''     The subsidies involved in CHIPA are made to encourage schools and  libraries to connect to the Internet. The funds thus are not intended  to facilitate a specific message, but rather to encourage the populace  to engage in the diversity of views that is the Internet. Also, like in  Velasquez, the money was given to one entity for the benefit of a third  party. In Velasquez, the money was given to LSC for the benefit of the  clients. In CHIPA, the money is given to schools and libraries for the  benefit of the patrons and students.     The situation in Velasquez and CHIPA is different than that in  National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley.<SUP>33</SUP> In Finley, the  Court found the challenged provision only required that the NEA take  into account ``decency and respect'' in making its grants. It was not a  determinative factor, but one of several considerations. Thus, Congress  had not disallowed any particular viewpoints in subsidizing the arts.     The Court specifically noted the situation might be different if  the NEA engaged in viewpoint discrimination:         If the NEA were to leverage its power to award subsidies on the          basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on disfavored          viewpoints, then we would confront a different case. We have          stated that, even in the provision of subsidies, the Government          may not ``aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas, [citation          omitted] and if a subsidy were ``manipulated'' to have a          ``coercive effect,'' then relief could be appropriate.          [citation omitted] <SUP>34</SUP>     Velasquez is the latest pronouncement in this area of the law.  Since Congress is using federal money to force libraries to violate the  First Amendment, Velasquez declares that, under these circumstances,  CHIPA is unconstitutional.     constitutional alternatives that are less restrictive means of                        accomplishing congress' goal     Congress passed CHIPA with the intent to protect children. For all  the reasons noted above, CHIPA is unconstitutional and will be  stricken, in addition to being ineffective.     As noted above, many libraries have already implemented options  that do not involve blocking software and are at least as effective as  blocking. These options include library web sites, educational  programs, and Internet Use Policies.     Many libraries have implemented their own ``home'' pages to help  patrons identify high-quality and useful sites. In addition to  providing its own content, a library may provide indexes of other links  it has evaluated and can recommend. Cataloging and organizing this  information helps lead users to resources in the subject areas of  interest and consequently helps them avoid unwanted resources.  Descriptions on the pages can assist users in deciding whether to visit  a particular site.     The same philosophy can be applied to library sites designed  specifically for children. The site can provide children with a safe  Internet experience by visiting sites reviewed by the librarian.     Many libraries educate patrons about Internet use. Through  education, librarians assist patrons in finding useful information and  avoiding unwanted information. Many public libraries offer classes on  the use of the library, the catalog, indexes and systems. In many  libraries, patrons are required to take such classes before they can  use public connections. These classes cover the library's use policies.  Topics for Internet classes often include: kinds of information and  subjects which are likely to be found on the Internet; how to construct  effective, high-quality search strategies taking advantage of features  of directories and search engines (truncation, Boolean searching,  searching on phrases); when to use various kinds of search aids; how to  evaluate resources found; and the advantages of using library-approved  Web sites and other sites known to collect quality resources.     Education was one of the recommendations made by the COPA  Commission in its report of October 20, 2000.     Libraries also may offer classes and resources to help parents  assist their children in using the Internet safely and productively.  Most reinforce the importance of parental supervision and involvement  with children when using the Internet. Parents should teach children to  be educated consumers of information and to talk to their parents about  what they find online. Parents may be advised to consider setting  boundaries on how much time children can be on the Net, and on the  kinds of information they look at. Children may also be instructed  about the importance of not giving their names, passwords, credit card  numbers, or other personally identifying information, or arranging to  meet anyone they talk to online without discussing it with their  parents. A good example of these guides is the Librarian's Guide to  Cyberspace for Parents and Kids, from the American Library Association.  (www.ala.org/parentspage/greatsites/safe.html)     Another method libraries use to educate patrons about Internet use  is the development of Internet Use Policies. These policies can remind  users about expected use of the library and of library resources in  general. The American Library Association has established general  guidelines for the development of library policies.     Many libraries require patrons to sign an Internet Use Policy  before they can access the Internet. These policies may explain the  diversity of information on the Internet, and point patrons to the  library-approved resources on the library web page. A substantial  number of policies discuss the decentralized, uncontrolled nature of  the Internet and warn patrons that they may encounter material they  find objectionable. The policy may explain that beyond the library web  page, the library does not monitor or control the information on the  Internet, and that patrons use it at their own risk. The policy may  inform parents that they are responsible for deciding what library  resources are appropriate for their children. The policy may also set  rules for Internet use, and can impose sanctions for violations,  including losing Internet access privileges, and reporting illegal  conduct to law enforcement authorities. In many cases, these policies  are tied together with educational programs.     There are numerous ways libraries can and do work with parents and  children to protect children while they use the Internet. These methods  are at least as effective as blocking technology without the side- effect of blocking much material that is constitutionally protected.                                conclusion     Protecting children is a laudable goal. CHIPA, however, fails to  protect children. No blocking mechanism or software is completely  effective. At the same time, CHIPA results in blocking a large segment  of constitutionally protected speech to adults as well as minors. Since  there are less restrictive alternatives, CHIPA is constitutionally  infirm.     The First Amendment is part of the foundation of our society and a  bedrock of our principles. Emasculating the First Amendment in the name  of protecting children only teaches our children that principles are  elastic and suggests to them that when those principles become  inconvenient, they should be discarded. Such a lesson leaves a child's  moral compass spinning. ``Indeed, perhaps we do the minors in this  country harm if First Amendment protections, which they will with age  inherit fully, are chipped away in the name of their protection.''  <SUP>35</SUP>     We can, and must, protect our founding principles as well as our  children. It is not an ``either-or'' situation. With thoughtful  consideration, both can be achieved.

The Court disagreed, noting that  the second prong of Miller contained a critical element omitted from  the CDA: that the proscribed material be ``specifically defined by the  applicable state law.'' The Court also noted the CDA went beyond  Miller's application to sexual conduct to include ``excretory  activities'' as well as ``organs'' of both a sexual and excretory  nature.

TAYLOR, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF COUNSEL,           NATIONAL LAW CENTER FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES      Mr. Taylor. Mr. Chairman, thank you. My name is Bruce  Taylor, and I am President and Chief Counsel of the National  Law Center for Children and Families, and we have been involved  with helping and advising, and even actually writing some of  the briefs for the Members of Congress who supported both the  Communications Decency Act and the Child On-Line Protection  Act, CDA and COPA.     In both of those instances, the Members of Congress who  passed that legislation, as was done here with the CHIPA,  narrowed the scope of the law so that they would more  adequately apply to the Internet, as opposed to the way that  obscenity, and child pornography, and indecency laws apply to  broadcasting or street crimes for obscenity or child  pornography.     The same was done here with CHIPA. Some of the problems  that have been identified by the ACLU, or the American Library  Association against this Act, CHIPA, are that they do not want  to have any regulations.     But the alternative to that is that one of the things that  everyone who uses the Internet knows is that there is a lot of  hardcore pornography and child pornography on the worldwide web  pages that are run by the pornography syndicates, and that are  on the UseNet News Groups that are posted by people all over  the world to put both obscenity and child pornography there.     And then in the chat rooms, where these people who go into  there, many of whom are teenagers, or pedophiles, post pictures  for the rest of the people in the chat room. So if no action is  taken by the library to try to filter out access to that, then  all adults and children can go into public libraries or in the  school terminals and get illegal, hardcore pornography and  child pornography, which is a felony even to possess.     So the alternative to that is what are we going to do about  this free availability of all of this kind of pornography, and  one of the things that Congress said to do with CHIPA is that  we are going to ask two things of libraries and schools.     One, you have to try to use a filter to block out whatever  you think--you as the administrators of the school or library  think--would fit within those categories of illegal child porn,  obscenity, or what is obscene for minors.     Now, the term, ``harmful to minors,'' is a legal term of  art, just like obscenity is, and just like child pornography  is. Child pornography is not any picture of a kid that you  think is dirty, or obscenity is not just something that people  think is offensive.     And what is harmful to minors is not what somebody thinks  will hurt a child psychologically or morally. Those are legal  terms that are limited to a type of pornography. CHIPA gives  the discretion for the local library or school to tell their  filter to block a certain kind of category, and it can work  with the filter company, and decide for themselves.     And so many of the types of abuses that are being  hypothetically or even in the past have been examples of  overblocking or under-blocking are examples that the filter  company and the library of the school can work together not to  see happen in reality.     Because even though there may be a few sites, one way or  the other--and like he said, there were 3, or 4, or 5 porn  sites that came through. That may be better than 100,000 known  hard core porn sites. But the Act itself gives the total  discretion to the school to decide with their filter company  what they are going to block.     And most of the examples that they use are when using a  filter, just like Consumer Reports did, that is set at the  parental control level that you would use if you were a parent  trying to put a filter on your home terminal to protect a 7, or  8, or 10 year old kid.     You don't have to use that setting on a filter, and filter  companies have various categories of material that they block;  from hard core pornography to soft core, to nudity, to hate  speech, to violence, to drugs, to gambling, to offense speech,  and a lot of other categories.     And if you enable all of those categories on the most  conservative setting, sure it is going to block a lot of  material that might be sexually oriented, but not obscene for  children, and not obscene for adults, and not child porn.     Most of the filter companies also have settings that are  much more liberal that say that we are only going to block that  which we have reviewed to be hard core pornography, sexually  explicit pictures of children, and the kind of soft core  pornography that you would find in Playboy, Penthouse, and  those kinds of magazines that are a crime to sell to a child at  a local convenience store.     So the filters themselves have not been adequately tested  because they have not been indocketed at the settings that  would be appropriate for a library or a school. Certainly a  library or a school for grade school kids can be set more  conservatively than for high school, and a library may say I am  only going to block the most explicit, penetration visible,  hard core porn, and only those sexually explicit pictures of  kids, and only that kind of soft core porn that you could not  sell to the kid at the local corner drug store. That is the  kind of pornography that I am going to have my filter do.     The other purpose of CHIPA is to do what Congress has been  trying to do with all of the money that it has put into the  Internet for the past many years. We have put billions of  dollars into the development of the Internet, and we are  putting $3 billion into wiring up every school and public  library in the United States.     We want to see libraries and schools become the next  centuries place for people to get information. The alternative  to having pedophiles go into libraries and downloading child  porn because they know that when a search warrant comes with  the police department, and they find out it is a library  instead of a pedophiles home, that's why they do there.     Adult porn addicts can go, instead of the local adult  bookstore where they have to buy it, to the public library. And  libraries don't like that either I'm sure, or they shouldn't,  but at least Congress and the State Legislatures don't have to  have that if it is State subsidized monies.     But that kind of money being put into the development of  the Internet is going to help hopefully improvement the quality  of filters so that next year when you say when one library told  their filter to block a certain kind of material and it did,  and then another library told their filter to block another  kind of material and it did, the filter companies are going to  be able to develop the technology with the help of this law so  that it will carry both functions and duties equally well.     So the criticisms of filters, and, oh, they don't work.  Well, filters use the same search technology that we use to  find information on the Internet. The Internet can do a lot of  am amazing things, and for them to say--I think it is absurd  for them to say that the Internet can do anything that you  want.     It has all this information, and billions of web pages, and  you can find anything that you want, but the only thing that it  can do is bring you information, and the only thing it can't do  is block it out, because it is the same technology that filters  as does for the search technology, and that is one of the main  purposes of this bill.     If we don't give this an experiment to say that we are  going to put this experiment into the hands of the toughest  critics that the country could find, meaning very--you know,  someone more liberal, and educated, and techno-savvy,  librarians and school administrators, they are going to be the  best ones to say here is where the filters worked, and here is  where they failed.     And when they report back to Congress, we will have a  better way than just guessing on what the bad things that are  going to happen. But one thing that I think is going to be for  sure is that people will be able to use the terminals.     [The prepared statement of Bruce A. Taylor follows:]   Prepared Statement of Bruce A. Taylor, President and Chief Counsel,               National Law Center for Children and Families nlc statement of legal arguments in support of the constitutionality of            cipa, the children's internet protection act of 2000     1. As a funding incentive, CIPA can require schools and libraries  that accept federal subsidies for discount Internet services (i.e.,  ``e-rate'' funds) to use filters to attempt to restrict access by  minors under 17 to that kind of pornography that is legally ``Harmful  To Minors'', as well as to restrict minors' access to visual  pornography that is legally ``Obscene'' or ``Child Pornography'', and  thus illegal even for adults.  A. CIPA only applies to grade schools and high schools, not colleges. B. CIPA only applies to public libraries that accept federal Internet          subsidies, not college libraries or private libraries that do          not accept federal funds. C. Internet subsidies are not an ``entitlement'' program for libraries          and schools. Conversely, federal subsidies for free Internet          access in public schools and libraries are an important factor          in the intent of Congress to make Internet access safe and          educational for minor students in their schools and for minor          children who are entitled to use public libraries without being          exposed to illegal and harmful pornography or exposed to adults          who are viewing such pornography on publicly accessible          computer terminals in taxpayer supported libraries.     2. CIPA provides local determination of what the filter will  attempt to block by allowing the receiving school or library to decide  what could constitute the three types of pornography that their  filtering software attempts to block, guided by the scope of the legal  definitions used in federal law:  A. ``Harmful To Minors'' (as defined in CIPA to be ``obscene for          minors''); and B. ``Obscenity'' (as limited to visual images in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1460          and defined by the Supreme Court, see Miller v. California, 413          U.S. 15, at 24-25 (1973), Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291,          at 300-02, 309 (1977), Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, at 500-         01 (1987), providing the constitutional criteria for federal          and state laws and courts); and C. ``Child Pornography'' (as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256 (8), i.e.,          visual depictions that are or appear to be of actual minors          under age 18 engaging in ``sexually explicit conduct'').     3. These three classes of pornography are unprotected under the  First Amendment for minors and obscenity and child pornography are  unprotected for adults, including on the Internet. The courts have  defined these categories of unprotected pornography as ``legal terms of  art'' so as to limit them to narrow classes of pornographic materials  that do not include serious works of literature, art, political speech,  or scientific or medical information. No adult has the right to gain  access to obscenity or child pornography in a school or public library  and no child has a right to access pornography that is ``obscene for  minors'' or ``harmful to minors'' in those settings and no school or  library has any duty to provide access to such materials on Internet  terminals.     The three classes of pornography that Congress requires schools and  libraries to attempt to filter out of their Internet access in exchange  for the massive federal subsidies that make such Internet access  available to all students and members of the public in libraries are:     A. Child Pornography: Consists of an unprotected visual depiction  of a minor child (federal age is under 18) engaged in actual or  simulated sexual conduct, including a lewd or lascivious exhibition of  the genitals. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256; New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747  (1982), Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990), United States v. X- Citement Video, Inc., 115 S. Ct. 464 (1994). See also United States v.  Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856  (1987), United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733 (3rd Cir. 1994), cert.  denied, 115 S. Ct. 897 (1995). Note: In 1996, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252A was  enacted and Sec. 2256 was amended to include ``child pornography'' that  consists of a visual depiction that ``is or appears to be'' of an  actual minor engaging in ``sexually explicit conduct''. Section 2252A  was upheld in United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61 (1st Cir. 1999), and  United States v. Acheson, 195 F.3d 645 (11th Cir. 1999). But see Free  Speech Coalition v. Reno, 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1999) (declaring  statute invalid as applied to child pornography that is wholly  generated by means of computer), cert. granted, sub nom Ashcroft v.  Free Speech Coalition (2001).     B. Obscenity (hard-core adult pornography): ``This much has been  categorically settled by the Court, that obscene material is  unprotected by the First Amendment.'' Miller v. California, 413 U.S.  15, 23 (1973). This is true even for ``consenting adults.'' Paris Adult  Theatre v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57-59 (1973). ``Transmitting obscenity  and child pornography, whether via the Internet or other means, is  already illegal under federal law for both adults and juveniles.'' Reno  v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 117 S.Ct. 2329, at 2347, n. 44 (1997). The  ``Miller Test'' can apply to actual or simulated sexual acts and lewd  genital exhibitions. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, at 24-25  (1973); Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291, at 300-02, 309 (1977);  Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, at 500-01 (1987), providing the three- prong constitutional criteria for federal and state laws and court  adjudications:  (1) whether the average person, applying contemporary adult community          standards, would find that the material, taken as a whole,          appeals to a prurient interest in sex (i.e., an erotic,          lascivious, abnormal, unhealthy, degrading, shameful, or morbid          interest in nudity, sex, or excretion); and (2) whether the average person, applying contemporary adult community          standards, would find that the work depicts or describes, in a          patently offensive way, sexual conduct (i.e., ``ultimate sexual          acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated; . . .          masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the          genitals''; and sadomasochistic sexual abuse); and (3) whether a reasonable person would find that the work, taken as a          whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or          scientific value.     C. Pornography Harmful To Minors (soft-core and hard-core  pornography): Known as ``variable obscenity'' or the ``Millerized- Ginsberg Test'' for what is ``obscene for minors''. See Ginsberg v. New  York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968); as modified by Miller, Smith, Pope, supra.  It is illegal to sell, exhibit, or display ``HTM/OFM'' pornography to  minor children, even if the material is not obscene or unlawful for  adults. See also Commonwealth v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 372 S.E.2d  618 (Va. 1988), followed, American Booksellers Ass'n v. Commonwealth of  Va., 882 F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1989), Crawford v. Lungren, 96 F.3d 380  (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1249 (1997). Under CIPA,  pornography that is ``Harmful To Minors'' or ``Obscene For Minors'' is  defined for Internet purposes to mean pornographic visual images  (``picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction''),  judged in reference to the age group of minors in the intended and  probable recipient audience, that could meet the following three prong  test:  (1) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient          interest in nudity, sex, or excretion (as judged by the average          person, applying contemporary adult community standards with          respect to what prurient appeal it would have for minors in the          probable or recipient age group of minors); and (2) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with          respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated          sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or          perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals (as          judged by the average person, applying contemporary adult          community standards with respect to what would be patently          offensive for minors in the probably or recipient age group of          minors); and (3) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or          scientific value as to minors (as judged by a reasonable person          with respect to what would have serious value for minors in the          intended and probable recipient audience).     4. Congress can also require these federally subsidized schools and  libraries to use filters to attempt to restrict adult access to visual  images of Obscenity (hard-core pornography) and Child Pornography  (sexually explicit images of minors), especially since such pornography  is contraband and unprotected even for ``consenting adults'' and  because the transmission or transportation of which by phone lines or  common carriers is a felony under existing federal laws (see 18 U.S.C.  Sec. 1462, smuggling or any common carrier transport of obscenity, even  for private use; Sec. 1465, transportation, for sale or distribution,  of obscenity across state lines or by any means or facility of  interstate or foreign commerce; Sec. Sec. 2252 & 2252A, transporting,  receiving, or possessing child pornography within, into, or out of the  United States by any means, including computer; Sec. 1961, et seq.,  RICO crime for using an enterprise in a pattern of obscenity or child  exploitation offenses.     5. The power of Congress to act by tax subsidy incentive is greater  than its police power to criminalize or provide civil liability for  unprotected conduct. CIPA is not a criminal or civil law and places no  restrictions on the citizens or public.     6. Library patrons who are adults are not entitled to access any  particular materials of their own choice in a public library or via the  Internet and even ``consenting adults'' have no First Amendment right  to obtain Obscenity or Child Pornography, especially at taxpayer  expense in federally supported public libraries or schools. Students or  library patrons who are minor children under age 17 are not entitled to  access pornography that is ``obscene for minors'', ``obscene'' for  adults, or child pornography.     7. Congress may encourage children to use Internet computers in  schools and libraries by subsidizing the use of pornography filtering  technology so that minors will be protected from exposure to such  illegal and unprotected images during their educational and  entertainment use of the Internet and computer services.     8. This Act requires K-12 schools and public libraries to provide  filtered Internet access to minors and patrons, but allows the  determinations and delegation of the filter process to be made by local  school and library administrative personnel, without federal  interference or federal judicial review.     9. CIPA allows for unfiltered Internet use for bona fide research  or other lawful purposes and makes those determinations totally within  the local administrators' discretion.     10. Congress already granted immunity to libraries and schools, as  providers of Internet access, for voluntary actions to restrict access  to illegal and objectionable materials, even if the materials are  constitutionally protected, as part of the ``Good Samaritan''  protections in the CDA, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230(c), so they will be free to  accept the e-rate funds and use filters without fear of legal liability  or harassment by users, special interest advocacy groups, or even  pornographers.     11. CIPA has a future-looking, beneficial purpose of encouraging  the development of filter technologies, thus furthering the mass  communications and Internet development goals of Congress. By  subsidizing Internet facilities in schools and libraries and asking  them to employ filter devices to try to restrict pornography from  reaching their computer terminals, Congress can create a market for  filter programs, foster research & development in the private sector  Internet industry for better and more customizable filter devices, and  re-evaluate the safety, policies, and performance of such ``technology  protection measures'' in light of the extreme scrutiny and competent  review that could be gathered from school and library administrators  and Internet access professionals who will be directing and evaluating  the filters, even when they personally or philosophically disagree with  or oppose the use of such filtering technologies in their institutions.  The virulence of their opposition can be the strength of their  constructive criticism, as Congress intends.     12. Without CIPA, many libraries and schools would continue to  provide unrestricted access by minors and adults to Internet terminals  that regularly expose them to illegal and unprotected pornography,  though many others will continue to provide filtered Internet access to  minor children and reduce the exposure of their students and patrons to  harmful pornography. This Act seeks to make all tax supported school  and library terminals open, freely accessible, and safe.     13. CIPA does not require subsidized schools or libraries to  restrict or filter any other materials other than what they themselves  think is Obscene, Child Pornography, or Harmful To Minors. The Act  requires no more, but does not interfere, on the other hand, with the  local school or library's choice, if they so choose, to try to filter  out violence, hate speech, or other dangerous and inappropriate  materials under their right to be ``Good Samaritans'' under the CDA's  immunity protection, either for minor children or for adults.      Mr. Upton. Your time has expired.     Thank you.     Ms. Morgan.      STATEMENT OF LAURA G. MORGAN, LIBRARIAN, CHICAGO PUBLIC                              LIBRARY      Ms. Morgan. Good morning. In a speech discussing the urgent  need for the Children's Internet Protection Act, Senator John  McCain stated the following, ``What is happening in schools and  libraries all over America in many cases is an unacceptable  situation.''     My name is Laura Morgan, and I am here today to tell you  that unfortunately that the Senator is absolutely correct. As a  librarian in the Chicago Public Library's central branch, I am  well aware of the serious consequences of a completely  unrestricted Internet access policy.     I sincerely thank the Committee for giving me the  opportunity to submit testimony in support of the Children's  Internet Protection Act. I also wish to commend the United  States Senators and Representatives who have supported this  important legislation.     I should also tell you that, of course, since I am  criticizing the library's policy that I am not representing the  library here, and I also want to say that my criticism should  not diminish the many wonderful things that libraries do in  this country, particularly the Chicago Public Library.     But that I feel that the problems that are happening cannot  be ignored, and need to be talked about. I am concerned about  this issue from four different perspectives; as a parent of two  children, as a woman, as a citizen, and as a member of the  library profession.     As a parent of two daughters, I am very concerned about the  children who are accessing pornography on library computers,  both intentionally and unintentionally. Due to our library  administration's adamant stance against filters, even in the  case of computers used by children, this happens far too often.     One example that I had when I worked--I worked at a branch  library for a couple of weeks in the month of December to help  out, and there was a 9 year old girl who said a completely  unsolicited comment to me. She said, you know, it really  bothers me when the little boys here look at what she called  nasty pictures on the computers.     We supposedly have a policy where we can tell kids to get  off of these bad sites, but obviously this is happening.  Obviously there is no way that every staff person can watch  what every kid is doing, and this is happening definitely at  the Chicago Public Library and elsewhere.     Again, I ask you is this something that we want to have  happen in our public libraries, when a 9 year old child has to  be exposed to this type of material, and as we know, there is a  lot of extremely hard pornographic material. We are not talking  about very minor material. This is very extreme.     In fact, some of these kids I noticed are very adept at  changing or making the screen go blank when you walk by. At  this particular branch, I noticed after some of these boys  left--and it is usually young boys--I could check or go into  the bookmarks and the search history, and very extreme Triple X  porn sites had been accessed.     So this is definitely happening. I want to point that out  again. As a woman, I am concerned about the porn surfers, who  are almost exclusively male, creating a sexually hostile  environment, particularly for female staff and patrons.     On the floor where I work--and I am the architectural  librarian in the main branch--we have male patrons looking at  pornography every day virtually. And they do this sometimes for  hours on end.     They will go throughout the building, and this is allowed  by our administration. We do not censor the Internet in any way  for adults. I also want to say that the fact that the male  patrons are doing this is not a big enough problem to begin  with, it does encourage bad behavior by these patrons.     Verbal harassment, even public masturbation has happened,  and I don't think it should be a surprise to anyone when you  make hard core porn available in a public building that this is  not going to happen. I made a complaint at a public board  meeting about this, which in-turn has lodged an investigation  by the sexual harassment office of the city of Chicago.     They are currently doing an investigation into this matter,  and interviewing staff, and I hope that the truth really  surfaces about what is going on throughout that system. One of  the things again that I am concerned about as a citizen is the  whole idea of the illegal material, particularly child  pornography.     There was a--Bill Harmoning, who is the chief investigator  for hi-tech crimes in Illinois, of the Attorney General's  Office, said that it is a well known fact in law enforcement  that pedophiles do like to go to public libraries and do this  because they cannot be traced.     Again, this is a person in law enforcement saying this. I  have also heard from security guards in the Chicago Public  Library that people are coming in and surfing through this  material. This is a fact.     Again, considering the heinous nature of these kinds of  images, I find this simply abominable, and that they are not  doing more to stop it. Finally, as a librarian, I am concerned  what all of this means for the future of public libraries.     The plain fact remains that public libraries have never  been in the business of providing hard core pornography in  print, not to mention illegal obscenity and child pornography.  The argument that we must provide it now simply because it is  available via the uncontrollable medium called the Internet is  absurd.     Must we now add X-rated book store to our list of services.  Is that what the public library has now become? Filtering  opponents often cite acceptable use policies as a solution to  the problem. I have become increasing convinced, however, that  these policies are not adequate.     And in many ways they are actually more intrusive and  subjective than filters are, because it implies that a staff  person is watching what people are doing. And in conclusion I  just want to say that I am one of those librarians out there  that does support the Children's Internet Protection Act.     The American Library Association is giving the impression  that all librarians are opposed to this. I do believe that the  hierarchy of the association represents a radical view that is  not shared by either the majority of librarians or the public.  Thank you very much.     [The prepared statement of Laura G. Morgan follows:]         Prepared Statement of Laura G. Morgan, Public Librarian                             i. introduction     In a speech discussing the urgent need for the Children's Internet  Protection Act, Senator John McCain stated the following: ``What is  happening in schools and libraries all over America, in many cases, is  an unacceptable situation.'' \1\ My name is Laura G. Morgan, and I am  here today to tell you that unfortunately, the Senator is absolutely  correct. As a librarian in the Chicago Public Library's central branch,  I am well aware of the serious consequences of an unrestricted Internet  access policy. I sincerely thank the Committee for giving me the  opportunity to submit testimony in support of the Children's Internet  Protection Act. I also wish to commend the United States Senators and  Representatives who have supported this important legislation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ U.S., Congress, Senate, Senator John McCain speaking in support  of Amendment no. 3610, 27 June 2000. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     On March 20, 2001, the American Library Association, the American  Civil Liberties Union and others, filed a legal challenge against the  Children's Internet Protection Act that became a law in December, 2000.  At a press conference, ALA president Nancy Kranich referred to the  61,000 members of the Association and stated that ``we are here  speaking for all of them today.'' \2\ This statement is troubling  because I believe there are many library professionals who do not  condone the ALA's legal challenge of CIPA, nor the Association's  ideology regarding Internet access in libraries. I am also deeply  concerned that many statements by the ALA hierarchy are at best  misleading, and at worst, simply not true. I hope that my experiences  as a public librarian in an unrestricted Internet access environment  will expose the seriousness of this issue and the need for the  Children's Internet Protection Act. I also hope my testimony will  encourage you to listen to those who object to CIPA with a great deal  of skepticism. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \2\ http://www.ala.org/cipa/kranichremarks.html ---------------------------------------------------------------------------               ii. the chicago public library: a case study     The Chicago Public Library's central building where I work, as well  as its seventy-eight branches, are a tremendous asset to the city of  Chicago. Mayor Richard Daley and Library Commissioner Mary Dempsey have  been tireless advocates for improving library services for all of  Chicago's citizens. Since 1989, I have held the position of  architecture librarian, as well as arts periodicals librarian, in the  Visual and Performing Arts Division of the Harold Washington Library  Center. I am truly grateful that I have had the opportunity to work in  one of the finest public libraries in the United States, if not the  world. It is because of this deep regard and commitment that I have for  the Chicago Public Library and the library profession that I have  chosen to speak out publicly against our Internet policy. While my  criticism of unrestricted Internet access should not diminish the many  positive aspects of libraries, I feel that the negative consequences of  such a policy can not, nor should not, be ignored.     Like the official stance of American Library Association, the  Chicago Public Library administration is firmly opposed to Internet  filters, even on computers located in children's departments. The  Chicago Public Library policy states:           The Chicago Public Library provides public access to the          Internet as a way of enhancing its existing collections with          electronic resources from information networks around the          world.           While the Internet provides many valuable sources of          information, users are reminded that some information on the          Internet may not be accurate, complete, current, or          confidential. The Library has no control over the information          on the Internet, and cannot be held responsible for its          content.           It is not within the purview of the Library to monitor access          to any resource for any segment of the population. The          Circulation Policy of the Chicago Public Library states:           ``The Library makes its collections available to all users          without regard to age, sex, race, national origin, physical          disability, or sexual orientation.''           The responsibility for use of library resources by children          thirteen (13) and under rests with the parent or legal          guardian.     The Chicago Public Library adheres to the principles expressed in  the following documents of the American Library Association (http:// www.ala.org/):  <bullet> Library Bill of Rights (http://www.ala.org/work/freedom/         lbr.html) <bullet> Free Access to Libraries for Minors (http://www.ala.org/         alaorg/oif/free--min.html) <bullet> Freedom to Read (http://www.ala.org/alaorg/oif/freeread.html) <bullet> Freedom to View (http://www.ala.org/alaorg/oif/         freedomtoview.html) \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \3\ http://www.chipublib.org/003cpl/internet/policy.html ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     In an article entitled ``Porn Again'' in the Minneapolis/St. Paul  City Pages, the Chicago Public Library Internet policy is summarized as  follows:           ``In the children's department, librarians keep an eye on          what kids are looking at and redirect them if they seem to be          looking at inappropriate Web sites, says library commissioner          Mary Dempsey. But in the adult areas, patrons are free to view          anything, including pornographic sites. ``Adults have a right          to look at those things. Adult terminals have privacy screens.          If they want to look at it, that's fine. But you don't have to          look at it, and I don't have to look at it,'' Dempsey says.          ``People are free to surf. We're a big city, with 3 million          people. What is objectionable to one person is not necessarily          objectionable to another.'' \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \4\ Kokmen, Leyla, ``Porn Again,'' Minneapolis / St. Paul City  Pages, 17 May 2000. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     The major problem with such a policy is obvious. The administration  is giving its tacit approval to patrons who wish to view and print a  vast array of hard core pornographic material that is normally  associated with an x-rated book store or peep show. There is no  precedent for this in public libraries, since traditionally this type  of material was never purchased in print form. Specifically, what I  mean by ``this type of material,'' are sexual images created strictly  for the sake of sexual arousal and gratification. The easy availability  of pornography on the Internet at the Chicago Public Library and in  libraries across the nation has great potential for negatively  affecting the staff, patrons (especially children), and the overall  environment. The administration claims that the ``privacy screens''  solve this problem, however, the screens do not completely block the  view, nor the negative behavior that is sometimes associated with the  habitual porn surfers. In my opinion, the Chicago Public Library  administration did not sufficiently consider all of the legal and  ethical ramifications of the chosen Internet policy. I am deeply  concerned about this issue from four different personal perspectives:  as a mother, as a woman, as a citizen, and as a member of the library  profession.                  iii. children and internet pornography     As a mother, I am very concerned about children who access or are  exposed to pornography on library computers, both intentionally and  unintentionally. Due to the library administration's adamant stance  against filters, even in the case of computers used by children, this  happens far too often. Prior to the spring of 2000, I had not given  much serious thought to the issue of children accessing pornography on  the Internet, primarily because, as of that date, I had not witnessed  it on the eighth floor where I work. What focused my attention was  hearing from staff in the Central Library's Children's Department that  children were occasionally accessing pornographic and violent web sites  on the twelve new unfiltered Internet computers donated by the Bill and  Melinda Gates Foundation. One of the more extreme examples involved a  child caught viewing a downloaded porn video displaying a woman  performing oral sex on a man. I was extremely disturbed by this  revelation because I had assumed that the computers in the children's  departments would be filtered. In other words, I had assumed that the  library administration would have chosen to make every effort to block  pornographic web sites from being accessed in the first place. To their  credit, the children's staff tell the kids to get off those sites when  they see it happen, but to me the damage has already been done. Whether  or not children are deliberately accessing these sites or stumbling  upon them by accident is not really the point, either. When it happens,  the images are there for anyone in the vicinity of the computer screen  to see. As an arts librarian and one who has a graduate degree in art  history, I can tell you that images are often much more powerful than  words. The Crimes Against Children Research Center's recent study  entitled Online Victimization: A Report on the Nation's Youth  corroborates this point. The study revealed that a significant number  of young people who are exposed to unwanted sexual material on the  Internet are deeply disturbed by it. Furthermore, the report's authors  ask the following questions. ``What if a quarter of all young visitors  to the local supermarket were exposed to unwanted pornography? Would  this be tolerated? We consider these levels of offensiveness  unacceptable in most contexts.'' \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \5\ Crimes Against Children Research Center, Online Victimization:  A Report on the Nation's Youth, Funded by the U.S. Congress Through a  Grant to National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (Washington,  D.C.: National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, June 2000), p.  33. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Over the past several months, I have spoken to several Chicago  Public library staff members who have described incidents of children  under the age of fourteen viewing pornography in children's  departments. In defense of their policy, the library administration  claims that staff can monitor what kids are doing at all times while  they are using the computers. Many staff have told me this is simply  not possible. One children's librarian told me that when she is not in  the department due to a day off or lunch, etc., it is a ``free for  all'' in the children's area, and that she often finds porn sites  bookmarked on the children's computers upon her return. Another  children's librarian commented how a young girl told her that the boys  were looking at ``bad things'' on the computers. I had a similar  experience while working at a branch library last December, when a nine  year old girl told me that it bothered her when the boys looked at what  she called ``nasty pictures'' on the computers. What kind of a message  does that give to a little girl about her local library, the place that  is touted as a ``safe haven for a safer neighborhood?'' At that branch,  I also witnessed how adept some of the boys are at hiding what they are  doing by changing the screen as someone walks by. After they left the  library, I could easily tell by looking at the recent search history  and bookmarks that they had accessed extreme XXX porn sites. What I ask  all of you today is this: have we as a society become so desensitized  that the idea of children accessing hard core pornography in a  children's library does not bother us? I sincerely hope this is not the  case.     In addition to children under the age of fourteen accessing porn in  children's departments, minors under the age of eighteen have been  known to access pornography in the subject departments of the central  library, as well as on the adult computers in the branches. I have  witnessed this myself, as well as hearing from several employees about  porn viewing incidents involving teenage boys. A librarian told me that  she saw some teens viewing Asian child pornography on the fourth floor  of the central library. One extreme example I witnessed was a young  teen looking at sado-masochistic images of nude women bound with duct  tape over their eyes and mouths. Just last week, I noticed a groups of  boys around one of the eighth floor computers soon before we closed.  After they left and I went over to shut down the computer, I noticed  several hard core porn sites were left open. Another group of teen boys  once left some print-outs by the computer of a porn site that boasted  ``Young Teens from Holland.'' I believe it is obvious that many  patrons, and in particular teenage boys, deliberately seek out porn on  Internet computers in libraries. This will continue to be true  regardless of how many ALA touted ``educational programs'' or  ``acceptable use policies'' are in place.     iv. internet pornography and the creation of a sexually hostile                                environment     As a woman, I am concerned about the porn surfers (who are almost  exclusively male) creating a sexually hostile environment, particularly  for female staff and patrons. Almost every day on the floor where I  work, I see male patrons viewing and sometimes printing pornography.  Security guards have told me that some of the men surf for XXX porn for  hours on end, by going from floor to floor. I was recently told that  the porn surfers now even frequent our ninth floor Special Collections  Reading Room, where one staff member jokingly refers to these men as  ``Internet scholars.'' In many cases, therefore, the Internet computers  at the Chicago Public Library become peep show booths. If the fact that  male patrons are allowed to do this is not bad enough, consider for a  moment the behavior that it encourages including harassment and public  masturbation. I have spoken to numerous staff members who have  experienced these kinds of incidents. One employee told me how a male  patron had pulled up an image of a sex act and said to her ``can you do  this?'' Several employees have experienced porn images being left  intentionally on computer screens. Other clever patrons have figured  out how to change the computer wallpaper to porn images. Some patrons  have been known to intentionally call staff over to ``fix their  computer,'' only to find that a porn image is on the screen. In the  worst case scenarios of porn viewing and accompanying behavior, male  patrons have been known to masturbate through their clothes, put their  hands in their pants, and sometimes even expose themselves.  Additionally, a library security guard told me that he often finds porn  print-outs in the men's restrooms.     Not surprisingly, patrons have also been offended by these  conditions. A woman told me a few months ago how it made her  uncomfortable that a male patron was viewing and printing ``dirty  pictures'' on the computer next to her. I heard a similar story of a  female patron on our seventh floor who was shocked this was allowed. A  recent incident on our fourth floor involved two patrons signing up for  time on an Internet computer, only to leave quickly upon realizing the  computer directly next to them was being used by a porn surfer. A third  floor librarian told me of a female patron leaving in disgust for the  same reason. It would appear that the library administration is more  concerned about protecting the rights of the porn surfers over everyone  else!     At a library board meeting on September 19, 2000, I spoke out about  these conditions, and mentioned the phrase ``sexually hostile work  environment'' in this context. In response, I was asked to speak to  attorneys in the City of Chicago's Sexual Harassment Office, which is  part of the City's Department of Personnel. It is interesting to note  that complaints by staff regarding Internet pornography had been  routinely ignored or brushed off prior to this date. It was not until I  made a public complaint for anyone to finally take this issue seriously  and contact the City's Sexual Harassment Office. A positive result of  my three and a half hour meeting with the attorneys on December 1, 2000  was their decision to commence a full scale investigation into how  Internet pornography is affecting the environment at the Chicago Public  Library. At the very least, I believe this is a step in the right  direction. Considering that the corporate world is taking the issue of  Internet pornography very seriously in light of sexual harassment  lawsuits, I am pleased that the City of Chicago is looking into the  matter. I recently spoke to one of the attorneys who confirmed they are  still in the process of interviewing employees and expect to complete  the investigation within the next few months. Once they complete their  report, they will give it to the City's Law Department, who will in  turn, make any necessary decisions.                v. illegal obscenity and child pornography     As a citizen, I am concerned about patrons who access illegal  material, in particular, child pornography. In a hearing I attended  last September, Bill Harmening, an investigator of high tech crimes in  the Illinois Attorney General's office stated that ``it is common  knowledge in the business of pedophiles and traders of child  pornography to go to your public library and download it because it's  there.'' \6\ Although he was not speaking specifically about the  Chicago Public Library, I have heard accounts by guards and staff that  patrons are accessing child pornography on library computers on  occasion. Considering the heinous nature of these kinds of images, I  find this simply abominable. In addition, many XXX porn sites qualify  as illegal under Illinois obscenity law, and thereby are indefensible  on First Amendment grounds for anyone. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \6\ Illinois House Republican Hearing on House Bill 1812, Marion,  Illinois, September 7, 2000. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                     vi. pornography at your library     As a librarian, I am concerned about what all of this means for the  future of public libraries. The plain fact remains that public  libraries have never been in the business of providing pornography in  print, not to mention illegal obscenity and child pornography. The  argument that we must provide it now simply because it is available via  the ``uncontrollable'' medium called the Internet is absurd. Must we  now add ``x-rated bookstore'' to our list of services? Is that what the  ``public library'' has become? Think about that, and what that says  about the library as a public institution. Regardless of what people  think of pornography on a philosophical level, I believe that most  Americans would agree that viewing and printing it in a public library  building is highly inappropriate. The library administrators who  prohibit porn surfing often claim that their ``acceptable use  policies'' are a solution to the problem. Such a policy would certainly  deter some of the porn surfers at the Chicago Public Library, but I  have become increasingly convinced, that these policies are not  adequate. In addition, such ``tap on the shoulder'' policies are much  more intrusive and subjective than filters, because they imply that  library staff are watching what patrons are viewing on the computers,  all the while making inconsistent individual judgments about site  content.       vii. internet pornography in libraries: a nationwide problem     In his report entitled Dangerous Access, 2000 Edition: Uncovering  Internet Pornography in America's Libraries, former librarian David  Burt documented numerous cases of children accessing pornography,  sexual harassment, adults exposing children to pornography, patrons  accessing illegal material including child pornography, and so on, in  libraries across the country.\7\ He collected the data by making  Freedom of Information Act requests to libraries for their Internet  logs, incident reports, and other data pertaining to Internet use. As  expected, the American Library Association discouraged libraries from  complying with Mr. Burt's requests, thereby resulting in a relatively  small return rate. The Chicago Public Library, was in fact, one of the  libraries that refused his FOIA request. Many people have speculated  that the ALA and many libraries did not want to comply because they  were wary (for good reason) of this kind of negative information  becoming publicly known. In my opinion, it is very obvious that there  is indeed something to ``hide.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \7\ Burt, David, Dangerous Access, 2000 Edition: Uncovering  Internet Pornography in America's Libraries (Washington, D.C.: Family  Research Council, 2000). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     There has been increasing media coverage of problems relating to  Internet pornography in libraries across the United States. Last year,  a major story broke surrounding the unrestricted Internet access policy  at the Minneapolis Public Library. Several courageous employees spoke  out about the egregious conditions there, and twelve ultimately filed a  charge of a sexually hostile work environment with the U.S. Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission.\8\ Even though conditions improved  once the administration adopted an acceptable use policy, librarian  Wendy Adamson recently informed me that some patrons still attempt to  break the rules and surf for pornography. Another library porn news  story involves the 21 branches of the Sno-Isle Regional Library System  in the state of Washington. As reported in the American Library  Association's online news, ``Councilman Dan Anderson successfully  argued for a council resolution earlier this month that asks the  library to amend its Internet policy to comply with the Children's  Internet Protect Act, to be phased in beginning April 20.'' Several  citizens have voiced complaints regarding adults and children accessing  pornography on the library's computers.\9\ Another recent news story  described how the Camden County, New Jersey Library System decided to  filter every computer due to problems relating to Internet  pornography.\10\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \8\ Oder, Norm, ``Minneapolis PL Modifies Net Policy,'' Library  Journal, June 1, 2000, pp. 15-16.     \9\ http://www.ala.org/alonline/news/2001/010402.html     \10\ ``Philadelphia-Area Library Found Internet Filters Far From  Simple,'' The Philadelphia Inquirer, 8 March 2001. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    viii. deconstructing the anti-filtering arguments of the american                            library association     I am well aware of the American Library Association's many  arguments against filters in public libraries and public schools, even  in the case of children's departments. At a few sessions I attended at  the ALA conference in Chicago in July 2000, these points were raised  repeatedly. As the Wall Street Journal stated in a editorial in  September, 1999, however, the ALA's ideology ``makes no room for common  sense.'' \11\ One of the Association's primary arguments is that  libraries simply make Internet access available and that parents hold  the sole responsibility of supervising their children when using the  Internet. What this statement does not take into account are the many  responsible parents who do supervise their children but who have no  control over the adult or unsupervised kid accessing a porn site on the  computer next to them. Additionally, by the time a child is of a  certain age, it is neither realistic nor possible to supervise one's  children 24 hours a day. In a speech advocating the mandated use of  filters on tax-funded computers, Senator John McCain stated that  ``Parents, taxpayers, deserve to have a realistic faith that, when they  entrust their children to our nation's schools and libraries, that this  trust will not be betrayed.'' \12\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \11\ ``Dr. Laura's Theme,'' Wall Street Journal, 3 September 1999,  p. W15.     \12\ U.S., Congress, Senate, Senator John McCain speaking in  support of Amendment no. 3610, 27 June 2000. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     A second ALA argument against filtering of any kind, is that  defending the right of a patron to access a hard core pornography web  site is no different than defending the right of a patron to access  controversial books, music, or videos from library collections. The  Visual and Performing Arts Division in which I work does, in fact,  include books on a handful of artists whose body of work includes  pieces considered controversial. All were carefully selected by  librarians because of the artists' prominence in the established art  world. Most of these books are kept in the closed reference stacks and  patrons must leave an I.D. to use them in the library. I think there is  an obvious difference between these relative few art books owned by our  department and the thousands of web sites that feature everything from  bestiality to child pornography. If these sites had print equivalents,  I can tell you with certainty that the Chicago Public Library would  never buy them. When filtering advocate and librarian David Burt  offered a free subscription to Hustler magazine to any public library  to prove this point, he had no takers. In a Chicago Sun Times editorial  regarding Internet access in public schools and Illinois House Bill  1812, writer Dennis Byrne adds, ``might I suggest that if school  administrators and teachers stocked school bookshelves and libraries  with the materials available unfiltered on the Internet, parents would  consider a public lynching.'' \13\ Why then does the American Library  Association and some library administrators treat the Internet as an  exception to traditional collection development policies? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \13\ Byrne, Dennis, ``Parents Need Help in Fight With Pop  Culture,'' Chicago Sun Times, 23 August 2000, p. 53. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     A third argument is that filters don't work. While I do not propose  to be an expert on filters, I have spoken to librarians who work in  libraries with filters on children's computers and even some with  filters on all computers. Everyone knows that no filter claims to be or  is one hundred percent effective, but the librarians who have real  experience with them tell me they suit their purpose quite well. One  library administrator told me that the odds of accessing an  inappropriate site with a filter on is about ``as likely as winning the  lottery.'' The ALA claims that filters give parents a ``false sense of  security.'' As a parent, I can tell you that I would be quite happy  with the odds that the administrator mentioned. In addition, the ALA's  favorite example of filters blocking most of the web sites about breast  cancer because of the word breast are simply not true.     A fourth argument against filtering or even acceptable use  policies, which prohibit patrons from accessing hard core pornography,  is that only a minority of users actually access objectionable web  sites. My response to this is who is to say how much is too much or too  little? Should the viewing of hard core pornography by children and  adults in public libraries be tolerated on any level? In January 2000,  the Wall Street Journal quoted Sarah Long, the previous past president  of the ALA, as saying that ``the American Library Association has never  endorsed the viewing of pornography by children or adults.'' \14\ The  editorial continues by saying that the ``problem is, it's never  endorsed their not viewing it, either. Quite the opposite.'' The plain  truth remains that unrestricted Internet access policies permit  numerous instances of porn surfing in libraries across the country. The  few examples I have provided represent only a fraction of the actual  situations witnessed by me and other staff of the Chicago Public  Library. If I had the opportunity to speak to each and every employee,  I am certain that everyone would have their own stories to tell.  Cumulatively, the numbers and situations would be significant. Then  consider the times this must happen on computers with unfiltered  Internet access in other Illinois libraries and elsewhere in the United  States. While some libraries have acted responsibly and at the very  least have installed filters in children's rooms and enforced  acceptable use policies for adults, many have not. The hierarchy of the  American Library Association and some others in the library profession  strongly oppose any state and federal mandates for Internet filtering,  most recently exhibited by their legal challenge to the Children's  Internet Protection Act. I believe they represent a radical view that  is not shared by the majority of librarians or the public. While they  will try to marginalize those of us who do not agree with the official  ALA party line as right wing extremists, I am proud to say that I have  always considered myself a liberal. And in the end, support of the  Children's Internet Protection Act is not a matter of left or right,  liberal or conservative, but a matter of common sense. It is time for  each and every one of us who is concerned about maintaining a safe and  welcoming environment for all library users to stand up and make our  voices heard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \14\ ``Taste--Review & Outlook: X-Rated,'' Wall Street Journal, 14  January 2000, p. W11.      Mr. Upton. Thank you.     Ms. Caywood, welcome.      STATEMENT OF CAROLYN A. CAYWOOD, LIBRARIAN, BAYSIDE AREA               LIBRARY, VIRGINIA BEACH PUBLIC LIBRARY      Ms. Caywood. Thank you. I appreciate this opportunity to  participate in this hearing. My name is Carolyn Caywood. I am  the Bayside Branch Librarian in the Virginia Beach Public  Library, and I have come to tell you how we have handled the  Internet in Virginia Beach, and to answer your questions.     My written testimony will provide more details, and while  those details are specific to Virginia Beach, we have borrowed  from and compared notes with hundreds of other libraries and  schools. So we know that they, too, are working on policies and  processes.     Library boards and school boards are finding what meets  their community, and States, too. Virginia requires us to have  a policy, and I know that some States even require filters.     I want to make four points. The responsibility for making  decisions about Internet usage should always be made at the  local level within the bounds of the United States  Constitution.     Libraries and school boards have this policy and they use  it every day. They are the best equipped to make the decisions  that best serve their communities. Second, technology cannot  substitute for an informed community, effective librarians and  teachers, educated families, and trained Internet users.     Third, resources that are devoted to education will be more  effective in protecting our children than will be federally  mandated filters installed at local expense, especially when  that mandate removes the patron's choices.     And, finally, filters do not work the way the CHIPA law  needs them to work. I'm sorry, but I have been pronouncing it  CHIPA for months. I have confidence in our Nation's libraries  and librarians.     Librarians share Congress' concerns underlying the law that  children's experiences on the Internet be safe, educational,  and rewarding. No profession that I know is more concerned  about children's safety, and development, and growth, than  librarians.     We have been unfairly maligned and our position has been  misconstrued by those who are pursuing a different agenda.  Their hype diminishes the concern that every one of the  librarians that I know feels for children as we work on  difficult policy decisions.     Librarians know as well as anybody else that new  technologies can create and exacerbate social issues, and we  deal with this. Virginia Beach receives $25,000 from the E- rate. We use filters in four ways. First, we have to go with--I  think you would call it KidsNet.     It is a list of selected URLs that are developmentally  appropriate to young children, and they can go to only those  that we have examined and embedded. Second, we block chat. We  agree that chat is not appropriate to library use in our  system.     Third, we provide choice on the other Internet terminals.  You can choose the one that is unfiltered, and you can choose  the one that is filtered according to your needs at the moment.     And the fourth one is that using again the blocking  ability, we block everything but our library's catalog on the  ones that are devoted the catalog. So we use filters in all of  these ways, and yet we would not be in compliance with CHIPA.  We would have to really go back to square one.     We went through a 2 year development process, and we would  need to repeat that to find a new community solution that  complied with the law. I think that CHIPA will have a  devastating impact on the ability of library users to access  constitutionally protect material. I think that it may increase  risks for children whose parents gain a false sense of security  if only those things that Mr. Taylor mentioned are blocked.     This is not what parents are thinking when they think that  their child is using a filtered computer. I believe that  communities must be involved in policy decisionmaking, and  while CHIPA permits some specific choices, it doesn't really  allow for the kind of policy decisionmaking involvement that we  have had in our community.     And it denies local communities the right to determine what  approach they want for their children and families. My branch  has six public Internet access terminals, in addition to the  kids net.     I hope that this hearing will provide us with the first  step toward a dialog about how many other ways we have found  that really work with our communities to handle Internet  access.     [The prepared statement of Carolyn A. Caywood follows:]   Prepared Statement of Carolyn A. Caywood, Librarian, Virginia Beach                               Public Library     Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important  hearing today. My name is Carolyn A. Caywood. I am the Bayside Branch  Librarian in the Virginia Beach Public Library System. My branch serves  a population of 85,000 people and our library system serves a  population of about 450,000 people overall. I have been a librarian for  over twenty-eight years.     I am also a member of the Freedom to Read Foundation Board of  Directors and an active member of the American Library Association  (ALA). However, I am here today in my capacity as a library branch  manager to share with you our experiences in Virginia Beach libraries,  experiences I know to be similar to situations across the country as it  relates to libraries and filtering and the implications of the  Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) enacted in the last Congress.     As you know, this legislation requires the installation and use by  schools and libraries of technology that filters or blocks Internet  access to various types of images on all computers as a condition of  eligibility for E-Rate discounts or certain technology funding under  the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) and the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act (ESEA).     I will leave the discussion of the legal and Constitutional issues  to the attorneys. We are all waiting for the results of the litigation  recently initiated by ALA and others. And, we are all waiting for the  promulgation of rules by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),  and guidance by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and  the Department of Education to see how the law may be implemented.     The Virginia Beach Public Library System, a department of the City  of Virginia Beach, has developed and implemented its Internet use  policies. While the details are unique to us, our story is similar to  those from hundreds and hundreds of other libraries in the country.  And, the story is comparable also to the K-12 public and private  schools. Communities across the country are already addressing the  issues raised by the Internet. Library boards and school boards have  already grappled with and developed policies and networks that meet the  needs of their communities. Some states, including my state of  Virginia, have their own rules requiring Internet use policies. A few  states require filters of some sort.     I want to make the following points with you in this testimony:  <bullet> Responsibility for making decisions about Internet usage          policies and procedures should always be made at the local          level within the bounds of the Constitution. Library and school          boards and their communities have the responsibility, which          they are already exercising everyday. They are best equipped to          make decisions based upon the needs, values and resources in          their respective communities; <bullet> Technology cannot substitute for an informed community,          effective librarians and teachers, educated families and          trained Internet users; <bullet> Resources devoted to education are more effective in the long          run to protect our children than having Federally mandated          filters installed at local expense, especially when that          mandate removes options for patron choices about using filters          or not.     For the record: I want to applaud our Nation's libraries and  librarians. All librarians share the Congress' concerns underlying this  law--that children's experiences on the Internet be safe, educational  and rewarding. No profession is more vitally concerned about children  and their safety, development and growth than our Nation's librarians.  We have been unfairly maligned and our position misconstrued by those  with a different political agenda. Their hype diminishes the concerns  that all of us have for our children as we all struggle to make these  difficult public policy decisions together. Librarians know as well as  anyone else, that, as new technologies proliferate, it is critical that  we balance the extraordinary value they bring to communications and  lifelong learning with responsible, safe use and careful guidance  through education and training.     The core belief of libraries is that knowledge is good. With it,  people can take charge of their future. Librarians take seriously the  First Amendment limits on government, of which we are a part, and we  promote intellectual freedom because that's the only environment in  which learning can thrive. Libraries are not prescriptive, we do not  endorse the contents of our collections or judge the information people  seek. Librarians cannot nor should not substitute for parents. These  important Internet decisions must be made by parents.     Libraries are tax supported institutions generally providing no-fee  public services. We ensure that each person has the opportunity to  learn and discover new ideas and different opinions. In recent years,  that has meant adding Internet access to prevent a Digital Divide  between those with access to electronic information and those without.  Not having Internet access is becoming a form of social  marginalization, but even owning a computer is not enough if a person  lacks the skill to use it effectively. The skill divide is as important  as the economic divide.     I believe the Virginia Beach situation, which is typical of what is  happening across the country, supports how these responsibilities are  taken fully and seriously. On the issue of E-rate and filtering in  Virginia Beach: we get $25,000 from the E-rate. We use filters in three  ways: 1) to present the best web sites for kids; 2) to block chat  rooms; and 3) to provide patron options for Internet searches in the  library branches.     For example, on the ``Kidsnet'' pages of our web site, our library  system uses filters to block everything but the URLs that have been  selected by our library staff. In other words, ALL other URLs are  blocked. Children going to the ``Kidsnet'' site find only materials our  librarians believe is age appropriate and developmentally appropriate  materials.     We provide ongoing classes and training sessions in the library  branches for different age groups, including family sessions. We  provide an online list of links for parents to learn more about using  the Internet, preferably in conjunction with their children. This list  includes interactive exercises that parent and children can do together  to find out and discuss questions about privacy, using the Internet,  safe web surfing, and so forth. I encourage you to review our web site:  http://www.virginia-beach.va.us/dept/library/families/kid.html     We have had, and continue to have, open, broad and ongoing  discussion within our community about Internet use and when and how we  use filtering. We will continue to apply for the E-rate but we cannot  break faith with our community and the policies it has established  through public dialogue, education, and local decision making. The  relationship between the community and the library in the development  of guidelines for access to the Internet, is extremely important in  Virginia Beach and elsewhere.     As a practicing librarian in a community that has developed a  policy for addressing children's Internet use, I believe that CIPA will  have a devastating impact on the ability of all library users to access  valuable constitutionally protected material. Equally, if not more  importantly, CIPA will actually increase the risks for many children  because filters give parents a false sense of security. What is more,  it strips library boards and local communities of local control and  decision making and will impose extraordinary financial and  administrative burdens on libraries and schools.     As a branch librarian in Virginia Beach, I have had direct  experience with the development and adoption of policies for library  patron access to the Internet. In my experience, the role of the  community in helping to inform and shape a solution is absolutely  critical. My concern with the law is that, while it permits some  discretion for local officials to determine what material is ``deemed  to be harmful to minors'' and what software to use to block content, it  denies local communities the opportunity to determine what approach  will best serve children in these communities in dealing with  challenging content.     It is not just that one solution doesn't fit all communities. It is  also that a Federal mandate on a matter so closely tied to local norms  and values is, in my view, counterproductive and even harmful. The law  may not only discourage communities from doing the hard work to reach  their own solutions and to educate themselves, it also lacks the  legitimacy necessary to foster broad community support.     While no one approach to Internet safety will satisfy everyone in  the community, I believe it is possible, indeed necessary, to work with  the community to fashion a ``bottom up'' approach that respects  community values, to address core concerns and to provide useful  solutions. Not surprisingly, local decision-making processes vary  significantly and the solutions are extremely diverse. But what they  have in common is involvement of the community, understanding of local  norms and values, knowledge of practices that take into account the  information needs of children and teens, and a general good faith  desire to work together to find a solution that respects the diverse  perspectives in the community. Libraries are educating and encouraging  parents and children to work together and have family dialogues about  how best to use the Internet and other library resources by developing  search skills, critical thinking and knowledge of risks and benefits of  using the Internet.     Virginia Beach developed our policies as part of a larger dialogue  on what kind of library services our community wanted and needed. We  started discussing the Internet and filters with the public as early as  1994. We also started a public dialogue about library services as a  whole and how the Internet and other electronic resources fit into this  mix of services. This was done as part the process we used for  developing long term plans for the expansion, construction and/or  remodeling of our library branches. These public dialogues were  extensive and held throughout the City in a series of eight meetings.  It included discussions of just what the public wanted in terms of the  balance between books and other printed materials vs. electronic  resources.     Starting with these community discussions, our library launched  many Internet education programs for individuals and families. It is  important that our education programs inform all stakeholders about the  Internet and its strengths and weaknesses so that informed decisions  can be made. We continue to provide Internet training for parents and  for families through classes and literature. In this process we  encourage parents to ask whether their children know their own family  values, whether they know and understand how best and safely to search  the Internet, and how to behave online, in chat rooms, and on email.     We discuss with parents that no one sends a toddler out to cross  even a neighborhood street alone. Adults accompany their children and  stay with them at the roadside, until they are mature enough and  trusted enough to cross on their own. As a child gets older they learn,  again with more adult training and supervision, how to cross busier  roads. They eventually learn that it is never wise to dash across a  major interstate highway. It just isn't safe. The same type of  incremental education and opportunities can and should be applied to  using online Internet resources.     Our library advisory board, like hundreds of library boards across  the country, has been directly involved in developing and leading the  public discussions that have shaped our policies. Staff at all levels  are also involved. We have provided continuing staff training and  discussion about these issues so that staff understand and feel  comfortable with the community policy. And, because this is a  community-wide issue and we are a department of city government, we  also met with the police department, the sheriff's department, and the  office of the Commonwealth's Attorney during policy development.     We met with the recreation department, the schools, and even the  public works department to inform and explain the community policy. If  someone finds something on the Internet that they think is obscene or  child pornography, we encourage them to go to the police with their  complaint to have it properly investigated. Our policy is not static-- just as the technology is not static. For example, right now we're  amending our polices to deal with instant messaging issues.     In our branch, we have six Internet public access terminals not  counting the terminal devoted to ``Kidsnet.'' Patrons have a choice  about whether to use a terminal that is fully filtered or one without  filtering. One terminal is fully filtered using I-Gear software. We  utilize their maximum level of filtering on that terminal which is in  an open desk-carrell. There are five other terminals with no filtering.     The unfiltered terminals are designed for maximum privacy so that  no one but that patron can see the screen. We do this in part so that  there is no ``visual startlement'' for any other patrons. You have to  invade their physical space to see what they are looking at. This is  extremely important for all types of users. (Imagine looking up  information about your own cancer treatment and likely prognosis in a  public area.) We respect that different people have different values  and comfort levels. That is why our community developed this flexible  policy that respects patron choice.     Even before we offered public access, we had extensive staff  training and discussion. We are sensitive to the concerns of our  employees to help them understand why and how the policy was developed.  We also have a complaint process although we remind people that we are  a library, not a court of law; we are not authorized to legally  determine whether something is obscene or not, whether it is  Constitutional or not.     Now with CIPA, those well reasoned and community supported outcomes  will be swept away and replaced by a blunt, indeed a crude instrument  that cannot respect First Amendment freedom, distinguish between the  needs of adults and children, or between the needs of a 7 year old and  a 17 year old. The law does not respect the diversity of values of our  communities or the power of concerned adults to find common sense  solutions to protect children. Sadly, the communities that will suffer  most from the CIPA mandate are those where librarians are struggling to  provide the first bridge across the digital divide and most need the E- rate discounts.     What is expected from librarians under CIPA? Simply put--to do what  cannot be done. As Clarence Page so eloquently put in a recent  editorial in the Chicago Tribune to, ``force them to bear the cost of  technology that is expected to do what technology cannot do: make value  judgement about what material may be too pornographic, hateful,  illegal, or violent for human consumption.''     It would be difficult to put a price on the loss of the library as  a ``mighty resource in the free market of ideas'' (6th Circuit 1976).  It would be difficult to put a price on the transformation of the  librarian into a full time content monitor and censor. It would be  difficult to put a price on the replacement of trained librarians and  teachers, working and living within their communities, by a filtering  company which must sell to a national market to make a profit and which  typically refuses to disclose its blocking criteria, their employees'  qualifications, their ``point of view'' or their biases.     Librarians are well aware that Internet access can create or  exacerbate social problems, but we are philosophically committed to  finding answers in humane, not mechanical ways. We look to education,  both for skills and character, rather than to technology, for  solutions. We cannot and should not substitute for parents. It is  precisely because libraries are not a mass medium that we have no way  of knowing what any individual child's parents would choose for that  child. We constantly urge parents to be part of their child's library,  not just Internet, experience because no one knows their child better  or can apply their personal values better. And, we do not want our  parents to have a false sense of security by relying too heavily on  technological measures. The Internet is not the issue--it's people and  behavior that are at issue.     Now, with CIPA, Congress has substituted its judgement for  libraries all over our country that have--with their communities-- tackled the tough questions on how best to guide children's Internet  access and reached a diverse set of solutions. When Congress enacted  CIPA, the issue of how best to guide children's Internet access  appeared to be treated as an easy ``yes or no'' decision. In fact, it  is complex and deserves a full range of discussion in the community and  in the Nation. In my experience, those discussions lead people of all  persuasions to recognize that there is no simple answer to this  complicated issue and to encourage us all to work toward a viable  solution.     In the end, the CIPA law forces libraries to make an impossible  choice: submit to a law that forces libraries to deny their patrons  access to constitutionally protected information on the Internet or  forgo vital Federal assistance which has been central to bringing the  Internet to a wide audience. It is because the CIPA law demands that  libraries abandon the essential role that they play in a free society  as the ``quintessential focus of the receipt of information.'' (Third  Circuit 1992) that the American Library Association, the Freedom to  Read Foundation and many local libraries and state library associations  have challenged this law in Federal Court.     Although I do not agree with the decision made by Congress, I am  hopeful that your Subcommittee will recognize the vital role that  libraries play in assisting parents to help their children and  themselves learn to use these marvelous resources in ways consistent  with their family values. Although I believe that CIPA cannot and will  not achieve the goals of the promoters of filtering, and that, in the  process, communities and the First Amendment will be the victims, I am  hopeful that this will start a renewed dialogue between your  Subcommittee, the library community and other stakeholders. I realize  that it is too much to suggest that Congress should revisit this issue  but I believe that we must work together on how best to provide our  children, lifelong learners and students with the skills and the  resources to function effectively and safely in the information age of  the Internet.     Congress must understand that there is ``no one-size fits all''  solution that the Federal government can impose that is better or more  thoughtful than the solutions communities adopt. Even as we all wait  for the pending litigation process to be completed, we in the library  community, stand ready to work with you and to continue this dialogue.      Mr. Upton. We thank you for your testimony, and again it is  made part of the record in its entirety.     Ms. Getgood, welcome.      STATEMENT OF SUSAN J. GETGOOD, VICE PRESIDENT, EDUCATION                        MARKET, SURFCONTROL      Ms. Getgood. Thank you. Chairman Upton and distingished  members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to  speak with you today about Internet filtering technology, the  reasons that so many schools use it, and how it works.     My name is Susan Getgood and I am Vice President for  Education Markets at SurfControl. SurfControl is the owner of  CyberPatrol, the most widely used Internet filtering software  in homes and schools. I have been in the filtering industry for  nearly 6 years, which makes me something of an elder  stateswoman in this area.     CyberPatrol was a member of the Plaintiff's Coalition that  successfully challenged the constitutionality of the  Communications Decency Act in 1996. One of the chief arguments  in that case was that filtering technology was more effective  than the law in protecting children from inappropriate content  on line. It still is.     The difference between now and then is that there are  vastly more children on line and the technology is vastly  better. More children are surfing the Internet than ever  before; about 30 million according to the last study.     Educators are well aware of the dangers on the Internet.  Almost all of America's K through 12 schools have Internet  access. Many directly in the classroom, and about 60 percent of  these schools already use filtering technology. In deciding to  use filtering technology to safeguard kids, educators have  parents squarely behind them.     According to a 2000 digital media forum study, 92 percent  of Americans thought that pornography should be blocked on  school computers, and most educators agree. Filtering software  puts the choice of how and when children should use the web  where it should be; in the hands of parents and educators.     Filtering software in 1996 was, and in 2001 continues to  be, the most effective way to safeguard kids from inappropriate  content on-line, while safeguarding our First Amendment rights.  Filtering software is safety technology, like seatbelts, for  Internet surfing.     Seatbelts are not 100 percent guaranteed to save a child's  life, but there is not a parent in America that doesn't buckle  up when they get in the car. In the same way, filtering  technology may not be 100 percent fool-proof, but are users say  it is more than 90 percent effective, and they demonstrate  their satisfaction with our products by buying it, installing  them, and renewing them year after year. CyberPatrol's renewal  rate is 90 percent.     Educators know that filtering software is reliable,  effective, and flexible enough to allow them to tailor it to  their specific needs. They also know what filtering technology  is not.     It is not a replacement for the guidance of parents and  teachers. Schools implement filtering technology for many  reasons, and clearly the most compelling reason is the desire  to protect children at school from anything to sexually  explicit content to how to build a bomb, and how to buy a gun.     Increasingly, we find that schools are also driven by  issues of legal liability and network band width. Schools are  already filtering, as are some libraries, regardless of any law  or government mandate. We currently have more than 20,000  installations of CyberPatrol in schools, school districts, and  libraries, across the country, filtering over 1 million school  computers.     I have been asked to tell you a little bit about how the  technology works. Despite the widespread use of Internet  filtering technology, there is a great deal of misunderstanding  about how it works.     In the case of SurfControl and CyberPatrol, human  reviewers, who are parents, teachers, and trained  professionals, build lists based on published criteria. We do  use artificial intelligence in the research process, but all  sites added to our list of inappropriate sites have been looked  at by a person.     This is an important point because it means that there is  no confusion over chicken breasts than human ones. Filters used  in schools and other institutions are usually server based and  integrate with existing network users and groups for the ease  of use by the library or the school.     In our case, we offer stand alone versions of CyberPatrol  for patents at home, and server based solutions for schools. In  our product, CyberPatrol, keyword filtering is strictly  optional. It allows more control, including blocking search  engine results, which can often be quite descriptive.     Using key word filtering can also filter out material that  is not inappropriate, a condition often referred to as a false  positive. Because of this, we offer key word filtering as a  customable option in our software, but never as a default  technology used to filter websites.     We are often asked why we don't publish the list. We have  spent thousands of dollars in 6 years of work creating a list  that cannot be duplicated and is proprietary. No one has ever  made a credible business case for reviewing the list, and  ultimately a company whose mission is to protect kids is not  going to publish a directory of dirty sites.     I am certain that every company in our industries feel the  same way. Filtering software is very effective. Independent  reviews consistently show our CyberPatrol to be 80 to 90  percent effective in filtering out inappropriate content. That  is much more than a passing grade.     But the ultimate test of the filter's effect in this is how  well it meets the user's needs. Each parent, each school,  decides how it wants to deploy the filter. And then last just a  few comments since I am running out of time on CHIPA.     We believe that CyberPatrol effectively protects children  from adult material and fully satisfies the Children's Internet  Protection Act requiring that schools and libraries use such  filtering technology to receive their Federal funds. We also  believe in choice, and believe that it should be up to each  library and school to decide what is best for its patrons.     Some schools mistakenly believe that the ACLU and ALA  lawsuits apply to them, and they don't. Many schools are  waiting for the FCC ruling regarding certification on April 20.     For the 60 percent of schools in this country that have  already implemented filtering software, this is a crucial date.  We believe that there is an interesting Constitutional case  regarding mandated filtering in public libraries, and we hope  that the ACLU and the ALA would stick to their legal arguments  and not turn to the erroneous arguments that filters don't  work.     Filters do work and they work well. We believe that a  simple self-certification is the best solution. We also think  that a message needs to be sent to schools to let them know  that this lawsuit is not about schools, and we hope that this  hearing and the FCC ruling next month will clear up some of the  confusion. Thank you very much.     [The prepared statement of Susan J. Getgood follows:]    Prepared Statement of Susan J.

The difference between now and then is  that the technology is vastly better. And, there are vastly more  children online that deserve protection.                    the growth of the net savvy child     More children are surfing the Net at home and school than ever  before. More than 30 million children in the United States have access  to the Internet, according to the Pew Project on the Internet &  American Life. Once online, these children find a wealth of valuable,  educational and entertaining content. But, as you know, not all online  content is meant for kids. The respected National Center for Missing  and Exploited Children estimates that 25 percent of children are  exposed to unwanted and inappropriate content online.     Educators are well aware of the dangers. Almost all of America's K- 12 schools have Internet access, many directly in the classroom and of  these, about 60 percent of schools already use some sort of filtering  device, according to Quality Education Data.     In deciding to use filtering technology to safeguard kids,  educators have parents squarely behind them.                     parents and educators speak out     A 2000 Digital Media Forum survey found that 92 percent of  Americans thought pornography should be blocked on school computers.     A Middle and High School Computer Lab Director at Silver Creek  Central School District in New York was recently quoted in the press  talking about the schools' wake-up call, and why it decided to buy and  install filtering software. The educator said:         ``I checked the history of each computer daily and was appalled          at the Web sites our students were able to access. Students          were visiting sexually explicit sites, gambling, applying for          credit cards, buying products with their parents' credit cards,          sending for free stuff and talking to strangers via chat          rooms.''     Ray Tode, School Technology Office for Andover, Massachusetts  schools, uses SurfControl's Cyber Patrol:         ``The Internet is an important tool for the classroom. But with          the Internet comes inappropriate sites. So we want to filter          out those inappropriate sites to protect our students.''                         about filtering software     Filtering software puts the choice of how and when children should  use the Web where it should be . . . in the hands of parents and  educators. Filtering software in 1996 was, and in 2001 continues to be,  the most effective way to safeguard kids from inappropriate Web content  while safeguarding our First Amendment rights of free speech.     Filtering software is safety technology, like seatbelts, for  Internet surfing. Seatbelts aren't 100% guaranteed to save a child's  life, but there's not a parent in America that doesn't buckle their  child's seatbelt when the family gets in the car. Similarly, filtering  technology may not be 100% foolproof, but our users say it is more than  90 percent effective and they demonstrate their satisfaction with our  product by buying it, installing it and renewing their subscriptions  year after year. Cyber Patrol's renewal rate is over 90%.     Educators know that filtering software is reliable, effective and  flexible enough to allow them to tailor it to their specific needs.  They also know what filtering technology is not. It is NOT a  replacement for the guidance of parents and teachers.                               surfcontrol     SurfControl is a leading provider of Internet filtering solutions  for homes, schools and businesses. It acquired SurfWatch in 1999 and  Cyber Patrol in 2000. Both of these companies were pioneers in the  Internet filtering industry.     Because SurfControl provides filtering products for all major  sectors--business, education, home and other technology companies--it  understands why each market deploys filtering software.     At home, parents purchase filtering software to protect their  children from inappropriate content online. Corporations implement  filtering software to maximize employee productivity, protect the  company from legal liability arising from potential sexual harassment  and preserve network bandwidth and security.     Schools implement filtering software for ALL of these reasons.  Clearly, the most compelling reason is the desire to protect children  at school from everything from sexually explicit content to how to  build a bomb and how to buy a gun. Increasingly, we are finding that  schools are also driven by the issues of legal liability and network  bandwidth.     This was confirmed by a recent survey we conducted asking 1200  customers how important network bandwidth was in their Internet  management this year. About 70% of the schools said that network  bandwidth was important or very important this year. This compares to  only 55% that noted its importance last year. The growing need to  better manage bandwidth in schools has been given additional importance  with the popularity of file sharing services like Napster and the  widespread use of streaming video.     What this means is that the majority of schools were already  filtering and now even more find it an important Internet management  tool--irrespective of any law or government mandate.     We currently have more than 20,000 installations of Cyber Patrol in  schools and school districts, filtering over 1 million school  computers. Business is booming.                         how web filtering works     Despite the widespread use of Internet filtering technology and its  longevity in the marketplace, a great deal of misunderstanding exists  about how it actually works. The most commonly used filters in schools,  like SurfControl's Cyber Patrol and N2H2's Bess, are category list- based products that filter by IP address or domain name.     In the case of Cyber Patrol, human reviewers, who are parents,  teachers and trained professionals, build the lists based on published  criteria. We use artificial intelligence in the research process, but  ALL sites added to our CyberNOT list of inappropriate content have been  reviewed by a person. This is an important point because it means there  is no confusion over chicken breasts and human ones.     Some products filter at the root, or domain, level. More  sophisticated filters like Cyber Patrol allow restrictions to be set at  directory or page levels, so you don't have to restrict an entire  website if one page contains inappropriate content.     The CyberNOT list is divided into 12 categories: Violence/ Profanity, Partial Nudity, Full Nudity, Sexual Acts, Gross Depictions;  Intolerance; Satanic/Cult, Alcohol & Tobacco, Drugs/Drug Culture,  Militant/Extremist, Sex Education and Questionable/Illegal & Gambling.  Other products used in schools offer similar categories.     Filters used in schools and other institutions are usually server- based and integrate with existing network users and groups for ease of  administration and security. In our case, we offer standalone versions  of Cyber Patrol for parents at home and server-based solutions for  schools. A new version of Cyber Patrol has been created for Microsoft's  ISA Server, the latest technology for Internet servers.     In Cyber Patrol, keyword filtering is strictly optional. It allows  more control, including blocking search engine results which can often  be QUITE descriptive. Using keyword filtering can also filter out  material that is not inappropriate, a condition often referred to as a  false positive. Because of this, we offer keyword filtering as a  customizable option in Cyber Patrol but never as the default technology  used to filter websites.     Typically, filtering software is sold as a subscription that  includes the right to use the software for a specified number of users  and a subscription to the vendor's list of inappropriate sites. As an  example, a 100-user license of Cyber Patrol would cost a school about  $1500 per year. We also offer schools an e-rate discount to help  compensate for the fact that e-rate funds cannot be used for filtering  software.                     why don't you publish the list?     We are often asked why we don't publish the list of inappropriate  sites. SurfControl has spent thousands of dollars and six years of work  creating a list that cannot be duplicated and is proprietary. No one  has ever made a credible business case for revealing the list, and  ultimately, a company whose mission is to protect kids is not going to  publish a directory of dirty sites. I am certain that the other  companies in our industry have similar feelings.                   how effective is filtering software?     Filtering software is very effective. Independent reviews  consistently show SurfControl's Cyber Patrol to be 80 to 90 percent  effective in filtering out inappropriate content. That's much more than  a passing grade.     But the ultimate test of the filter's effectiveness is how well it  meets the user's needs. Each parent, each school decides how it wants  to deploy the filter. The most commonly used filters like Cyber Patrol,  Bess and Net Nanny allow users to make their own choices about what is  restricted or allowed. The user can choose which categories to use,  customize filtering levels to individual kids or classes and even  create their own list of content to be restricted or allowed. For  example, with Cyber Patrol a school can restrict all sexually explicit  content for younger children and allow our Sex Education category,  which includes important resources like Planned Parenthood, for older  children.     Filtering software, including the server-based software used in  schools, is highly tamper resistant. It is also designed to be easy to  use, for the busy school technology coordinator, and easy to customize,  to satisfy the teachers who need adjustments made to meet educational  goals.     Ultimately, in a competitive market economy, companies like ours  are successful because we offer products that meet the needs of our  customers. Our customers require, and get, the best tools possible for  managing Internet access and our development team works every day to  constantly improve the technology.                surfcontrol's cyber patrol satisfies chipa     SurfControl's Cyber Patrol software effectively protects children  from adult material online and fully satisfies the Children's Internet  Protection Act requiring schools and libraries that receive federal aid  for Internet service to use such filtering technology.     Thousands of schools and libraries nationwide have been using Cyber  Patrol and other filters for years. Our focus was and continues to be  on schools, not libraries. We do not market to libraries. But we do  believe in choice. We believe it should be up to each local library to  decide what is best for its patrons.     Cyber Patrol does not have separate categories for ``Child  Pornography'' or ``Obscene by Legal Definition.'' These are legal terms  requiring interpretation by attorneys and the courts. But Cyber Patrol  does block illegal and pornographic material. It also filters obscene  speech that has been defined by the courts. And we filter other online  material that many people deem inappropriate for children, such as  gambling, violence, hate speech, cults, alcohol and tobacco. Using the  custom list capability, any user could also create their own  restrictive list, for example, of sites determined by a local court to  be obscene.     The ACLU and the ALA have an interesting constitutional case  regarding mandated filtering in public libraries. We had hoped they'd  stick to the legal arguments, and not turn to the erroneous argument  that filters don't work. Filters do work, and they work well. But they  have not stuck to the legal case and the result has been some  confusion.     Some schools mistakenly believe the ACLU and ALA lawsuits apply to  them. They don't. Many schools are waiting for the FCC ruling regarding  certification on April 20. For the 60% of schools in this country that  have already implemented filtering software, this is a crucial date.     We believe that a simple self-certification is the best solution.  We think that a message needs to be sent to schools to let them know  the lawsuit is not about schools. This hearing and the FCC ruling may  help clear up some of the confusion.     Filtering software products like Cyber Patrol are technical  solutions to help implement school policy and choice. SurfControl makes  the software; our users make their own choices about how they will use  it in their home, school or business. Our job is to meet the needs of  our users and we will continue to do so as those needs, and the  Internet itself, change and evolve. Thank you.      Mr. Upton. You did very well speaking very fast. I would  just note that your entire remarks are made part of the record,  and for purposes of an introduction, I yield to a good friend  and Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Largent, from Oklahoma.     Mr. Largent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to welcome a  friend and a constituent from Tulsa, Chris Ophus. He is the  President of FamilyConnect, an Internet filtering service that  we employ in our own home, and, Chris, we want to welcome you  to the Subcommittee and look forward to your testimony.       STATEMENT OF CHRISTIAN OPHUS, PRESIDENT, FAMILYCONNECT      Mr. Ophus. Thank you. I appreciate it. As Congressman  Largent said, my name is Chris Ophus. I am co-founder and  president of a company called FC Technologies, and that  specifically deals in filtering technology and to create  workable solutions.     I am also currently serving as the president of the  Internet Safety Association, which is a group of Internet  filtering technology companies that have come together to be  able to offer solutions very much in particular to what this  bill has to say.     I, as the same as Ms Getgood, and I do agree with what she  has said, have such a tremendous amount of information that  there is no way to cover it all, and what I would like to do is  just cover a couple of things.     The Internet is without a doubt the most unique mass medium  that is out there. It is a convergence of all the mass  mediums--radio, television, print, mail. They are all coming  together as one.     And because it is an emergent technology, there is a unique  set of problems that have been created because of the open  forum, the open software and the way it works, and the  technology, and it creates a lot of problems.     But part of the problem that we are seeing here is we are  seeing an attack on Internet filtering because of the First  Amendment, and the First Amendment is a very sacred cornerstone  to our government, and we all believe in that, but there are  obvious exceptions: obscene, illegal, and harmful to minors  material.     My big question is why is there all this controversy here.  What makes the Internet as it is used in public schools and  libraries immune to some of these existing laws that are  already in place?     You have got to have exceptions; child porn and a lot of  the violence, and rape, and molestation, and those types of  things, filters really are the best way to block that and keep  the good.     Now, I will say that as anybody else who works in the  filtering industry, filters are not fool proof. But one of the  other things that we have been seeing a lot of is that there is  all different kinds of filtering products.     There are some that are client side, and some that are  server side, and Ms. Getgood mentioned that. In a recent  Consumer Reports article--and Mr. Johnson mentioned that just a  few moments ago--there was a test done.     And the test basically covered about six products that were  in the consumer side, and the results were very negative. And  because of that report, I had sent a letter to the editor,  David Hyme, of Consumer Reports, outlining some of the things  that I thought were concerns with his report; the small sample  size, and the unknown criterion, whether or not the sample was  random; testing only 6 of the 141 products that get netwised  out of ORD lists.     And also not testing educational filters, and I have a copy  of the Consumer Reports letter that he returned to me, but I  want to just outline in the next to last paragraph that he  returned a response and said, ``we are, however, guilty of  testing only so-called client side software.     ``Since our founding, we focused on testing products  available to consumers. It is not part of our breach to test  software sold exclusively to schools and libraries.''     Now, the Consumer Reports article is being mentioned by the  American Library Association, and the ACLU, is proof positive  that filtering does not work; when in fact what is happening is  that they are testing some of the lower level filtering systems  and painting the entire filtering industry with that brush, and  that simply is not true.     The truth is that filtering does work. I would like to make  another comment regarding what he had said, and I will include  it in my testimony, because I feel that it is very important.  And that is regarding education. That education alone, or as a  component of some other ideas aside from technology protection  measures, can somehow be able to protect us.     If you take an example of drivers education. We have  drivers education and all the drivers education in the world is  not going to stop teenagers, or even adults, from getting into  accidents, and Ms. Getgood even mentioned the seat belt laws.     We have laws that are going to try to do the best that they  can to be able to control and manage this kind of technology. I  would like to quote another gentleman, Christopher Hunter, who  was one of the COPA panelists which was also mentioned.     And he said that the majority of the reports about Internet  content filters being both under and over inclusive--he was  talking about blocking--are from journalists and anti- censorship groups who have used largely unscientific methods to  arrive at the conclusion that filters are deeply flawed.     If you look at some of the other testing that is done out  there, there have been some larger tests, some comprehensive  tests, one by David Burt, in ``Dangerous Access 2000,'' where a  particular filtering product was used in the public library in  Cincinnati over a large period of time, a large sample.     And found that they only wrongly blocked sites .019 percent  of the time. There have been similar studies in other libraries  that have done this type of thing. So, I would say in  conclusion that there is a crying need for Internet filtering  out there.     And out of the all of the decisions that need to be made by  this subcommittee, certainly whether or not filtering is  effective should not be one of them. The technology exists out  there; the artificial intelligence, computer spidering, human  review, millions of data bases categorized, and all of those  things come together to provide the effective tools that  librarians and educators need and already have to be able to be  effective. Thanks.     [The prepared statement of Christian Ophus follows:]    Prepared Statement of Christian Ophus, President, Internet Safety                                Association                               introduction     My name is Christian Ophus, I am the co-founder and President of  FamilyConnect, Inc. and S4F Technologies, Inc., a filtering technology  provider founded in 1997 and headquartered in Tulsa, OK.     In addition to my corporate duties, I currently serve as President  of the Internet Safety Association, founded in September 2000 and  headquartered in Washington D.C. The ISA (Internet Safety Association)  was created by leaders in the Internet Content Management Industry to  promote safe use of the Internet for all users.     I would like to thank the U.S. House of Representatives Committee  on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the  Internet for inviting me to submit testimony.     I will focus my comments specifically on filtering & Internet  content management technology, offering background, current approaches  and tools, and future developments.         technology protection measures--why are they necessary?     The Internet is truly the most comprehensive and unique mass medium  in the history of communication. The Internet is rapidly becoming the  convergence of all other forms of communication. Television, radio,  print, postal service and telephone service, are all available via the  Internet. But even more amazing, is that the Internet has become the  new backbone of these other communication mediums, ensuring that the  Internet industry is here to stay. Our dependency upon this new medium  has flourished, especially in the past decade. The Internet is an  emerging technology that has it's own set of problems.     The Internet is essentially an open network with a common language  that allows anyone worldwide to access and transmit information. It is  essentially a public forum, which fosters the free transmission of  information and ideas.     One of the sacred cornerstones of the founding fathers was to  preserve the free transmission of ideas and information. That is why  the very first amendment covered this issue. However, there are obvious  exceptions to the first amendment. Information that is obscene, illegal  and harmful to minors is not protected under the first amendment.  Outside of the Internet, this type of information in any other medium  is prosecutable under existing laws and regulations. To understand why  illegal content via the Internet has become so controversial is  puzzling. One might ask: What makes the Internet immune to existing  laws and statutes that are already in place to protect individuals from  material that is deemed detrimental in nature?     Although the Internet is a viable tool for business, education and  commerce, there is a significant amount of obscenity and illegal  information. The goal is to limit access to this type of material  without affecting the overall Internet experience for the user.  Filtering technology is the best alternative to solving these issues.     Historically, there has been controversy concerning the  effectiveness of filters. The rapid growth and dynamic nature of the  Internet make Internet filtering a constant moving target.     In the mid-nineties, a few companies emerged in an effort to offer  technological solutions to the ever-expanding problem of detrimental  and illegal activity on the Internet.     The first approach relied on artificial intelligence to block  access to pornographic or objectionable material. These systems were  based on keyword filters that would filter incoming data and look for  words such as ``sex'', ``XXX'' or ``breast''. This type of approach  was, in fact, good at identifying pornographic & illegal websites, but  inadvertently blocked legitimate site searches such as ``Middlesex'',  ``Super bowl XXX'' or ``chicken breast recipes'', etc. To solve this  problem, new ways of filtering would have to be developed.     Many opponents of filtering use the argument that filters still  make these kinds of mistakes. Today's technology has risen far above  these early products by using computers that scour the Internet coupled  with human review to ensure a high level of accuracy.     In fact, today's Technology protection measures are more advanced  than ever before. Not every filtering product is the same. In the same  way that there are different types of automobiles, some have more  features than others, some are more expensive and then there are some  that were created with specific purposes in mind. If your desire were  to race in the Daytona 500, then you would not drive a Yugo. If your  goal were fuel economy, you would not drive a Hummer. Similarly, there  are different types of filters for different objectives. Some are less  expensive and offer less protection and less control. At the same time,  there are filtering products that have been specifically designed to  operate in a more commercial application such as large corporations,  schools and libraries.     To ensure successful lasting implementation of a technology  protection measure, you must fit the product with the application.  Opponents of filtering have misled the public into believing that  filtering does not work, or more accurately, does not work well. The  justification for this claim has been a few isolated studies where the  testing criterion is questionable and the results generalized.     In March 2001, Consumer Reports published an article about  filtering technology where 6 off-the-shelf filtering products were  tested. The results indicated that the tested products did poorly when  the testing criterion was applied. The article proceeded to question  the government's imposition of filtering on schools and libraries  through the Children's Internet Protection Act, citing that the test  results were clearly negative.     In response to the article, I wrote the editor of Consumer Reports  on February 23, 2001 and questioned the products tested and the  criterion used to test the effectiveness. Here is an excerpt of that  letter:           ``First, the objectionable content site sample used, 86, was          obviously but a small fraction in comparison to the vast number          of adult and illegal websites on the web. To effectively test          any filter, a more appropriate sample might have been 10,000 or          even higher.           Second, a thoughtful set of criteria should be established in          the selection of sites to be tested to ensure that the sites          chosen are a statistically accurate representative sample of          the range and type of objectionable sites found on the web.          Your article did not indicate what criterion, if any, was used          to determine which 86 sites were to be used. For example, we do          not know if the author searched for 86 obscure sites or chose a          random sample from a popular search engine. The answer to that          question would dramatically affect the outcome of your informal          survey.           Third, only six of the 141 filter-related products listed on          the popular information website www.getnetwise.org were tested.          The products tested, with the exception of AOL's parental          controls, are client-side products. No server-side filter          systems were tested. Also, some of the most popular filter          programs were not included in the test.           Fourth, none of the filters tested are those typically used          in the educational space. Filters such as N2H2, X-stop, I-gear,          S4F and Web Sense were not even mentioned, and these products          represent the vast majority of the access-control market share.          Would it not be reasonable to test those products that are most          commonly used and perhaps those who have made the greatest          advancement in creating solutions that work for everyone?           Fifth, the test conducted did not include one of the most          important aspects of filtering, the ability of the software to          be overridden or bypassed by web-savvy kids. A filter can be a          false sense of security to a parent or educator if it can be          easily bypassed. Features such as this contribute greatly to          the overall value and effectiveness of a filter.           I hope you can see how these seemingly innocent oversights          lead to erroneous, generalized conclusions. The fact is, there          have been significant advancements by many companies even in          the past year that validate the claim that filtering works and          is effective in protecting children from illegal and dangerous          information.''     In response to my letter, I received a return letter dated March  7th, 2001 where the editor admitted that the products tested were from  the consumer level and not those used in the educational space.           ``We are, however guilty of testing only so-called client-         side software. Since our founding in 1936, we've focused on          testing products available to consumers at the retail level. It          is not part of our brief to test software sold exclusively to          schools or libraries. By analogy, we would test garden hoses,          sponges and auto polish, but not commercial car-wash          equipment.''     I encouraged the editor to consider a more comprehensive test where  some of the more popular and broadly used filters could be included. I  am sure the results would be entirely different.     David Burt, in his written testimony before the COPA commission in  July of 2000, cited several larger studies of Internet filtering  products where the outcome of filtering effectiveness was quite  different.     In the Dangerous Access, 2000 edition by David Burt, the filter  product, Bess, used at the public library in Cincinnati and Hamilton  County wrongly blocked sites only .019% of the time.     A study by Michael Sims ``Censored Access in Utah Public Schools,  1999'' found error blocking rates at .036%. These numbers are a far cry  from so-called tests being highlighted by filtering opponents.     Christopher Hunter, a COPA panelist said:           ``The majority of reports about Internet content filters          being both under inclusive and over inclusive have come from          journalists and anti-censorship groups who have used largely          unscientific methods to arrive at the conclusion that filters          are deeply flawed.''                 current approaches to content filtering     There are two typical approaches to filtering--inclusion filtering,  and exclusion filtering. Inclusion Filtering--White Lists     With inclusion filtering, Internet users are permitted access to  particular ``allowed'' sites. This type of filtering can be 100%  effective--assuming the person or organization that has compiled the  white list that shares the same set of values as the Internet user.  Because of the global nature of the Internet, it is difficult to create  with a globally accepted set of criteria. The main drawback of  inclusion filtering is that the ``acceptable list'' would have to be  enormous to be accurate. The creation of a blocked list tends to be  more manageable. Exclusion Filtering     Exclusion filtering is based on black lists (or block lists) of  objectionable sites. This is a more common form of filtering than  inclusion filtering, and has the advantage that black lists will  invariably be smaller than white lists. A second advantage is that  unrated sites are presumed to be innocent till proven guilty, and so do  not need to be automatically excluded.     Both types of content filtering require a constant effort to  maintain a valid and updated list for use by the user. The most  effective approach is to use the benefit of computer technology,  coupled with unique capabilities in human review.                       what content can be blocked?     In the early days, companies offered 1 or more categories of  blocked sites, offering little or no control to the end-user. Today,  most companies offer multiple categories and varying levels within  these categories, giving complete control and flexibility of  application to the end-user.     Some filtering providers offer as many as 35 categories allowing  the administrator complete local control over what is being blocked.  Here is an example of a typical category listing from N2H2:           Adults Only, Auction, Chat, Drugs, Education, Electronic          Commerce, Employment Search, For Kids, Free Mail, Free Pages,          Gambling, Games, Hate/Discrimination, History, Illegal, Jokes,          Lingerie, Medical, Message/Bulletin Boards, Moderated, Murder/         Suicide, News, Nudity, Personal Information, Personals,          Pornography, Recreation/Entertainment, School Cheating Info,          Search, Search Terms, Sex, Sports, Stocks, Swimsuits,          Tasteless/Gross, Tobacco, Violence, Weapons     Most of the above categories are not classified as illegal or  detrimental in nature, but give the user a wide range of control when  determining what information is appropriate for the viewer or more  commonly, for what application the filter is being used.     An employer may want to block access to job sites or other non-work  related sites to reduce employee Internet abuse in the workplace.  Several studies have indicated that loss of productivity from Internet  use has cost employers billions of dollars each year.     The point is filtering products today offer the user a wide range  of options and combinations that allow the user to determine what is  and is not blocked. In the educational space, the local school board  can determine what information is appropriate to block based upon  community standards, federal laws and the individual states harmful to  minors statutes.                      how filtering is accomplished     There are several approaches to filtering content. As technology  has progressed, the most effective methods have been improved, new ways  to filter have been developed and many products have taken the best  features from each approach and created a hybrid of several methods.     There are four primary methods that are used in varying degrees. URL Filtering     This is the most common, and most effective form of filtering, and  involves the filtering of a site based on its URL (i.e. its address).  It provides more fine-grained control than packet filtering, since a  URL can specify a particular page within a large site, rather than  specifying the IP address of the computer that hosts the Content.     S4F Technologies adds an average of 5,000--7,000 new URL's to its  database each week. Computer spiders scour the Internet using a  sophisticated search mechanism that collects potential sites for human  review. Spidering computers run programs that systematically read  through the World Wide Web and collect URL's (Uniform Resource  Locators) that match a particular set of criteria established a  filtering department. These computer can run 24 hours a day and collect  potential candidates to be added to the database. However, spiders are  not perfect, and using spiders alone as the mechanism for fortifying a  blocked site database would result in overblocking. That is why human  review must be used when accurately building a blocked database.     During the human review process, using custom browsers, sites can  be positively identified and properly added to the database. As soon as  a site is added, it is active in the blocked list for all to use. If a  site is inadvertently blocked, it is reviewed and a decision is made  within 24 at the most. If the site contains Child Pornography it is  automatically forwarded to the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children.     One of the challenges facing filtering departments is managing the  constant change of the Internet. When a website is reviewed, it may not  contain obscene material, but at some later point, the author of the  website may change the content that now would be considered  inappropriate. Conversely, a site with content that may have at one  time been considered pornographic or illegal could change and be  perfectly acceptable. So, in addition to keeping up new sites that come  online daily, filtering departments must constantly review those sites  that are already categorized.     Considering the ongoing task of Internet content data management,  coupled with the constant change in the Internet snapshot, filtering  companies do an amazing job of keeping up. Keyword Filtering     Keyword filtering was the first generation of filtering. With  keyword filtering, content is scanned as it is being loaded into a  user's computer for keywords, which are included in a black list. A  site is blocked if it contains any of the words in the block list.     The advantage of keyword filtering is that it adds very little  computational overhead. The main disadvantage is that it checks text  only, and cannot block objectionable pictures, plus, some products  filters are indiscriminate, as the context is not taken into account.     However, one of the advances of S4F Technologies, is the  development of IKSSB (Intelligent Keyword Search String Block out)  where the keyword component operates as a secondary line of defense to  the primary specific URL block out database, and has the ability to  decipher the difference between a website containing pornography, and  one that has text which contains the word pornography.     For example the IKSSB can differentiate between searches for  ``breast'' and ``chicken breast recipes'' or another example, the  difference between ``sex'' and ``Middlesex, England''. Both of these  examples have been tirelessly used by opponents of filtering to claim  that keyword filters can block useful sites.                    IKSSB Keyword Search String Examples ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sex.......................................  Middlesex, England, Sexually                                              Transmitted Diseases, Sex                                              Education, Sextant Breast....................................  Chicken Breast, Breast                                              Cancer ------------------------------------------------------------------------      Although S4F uses this filter component as a secondary line of  defense, it exhibits the technological adaptation of filtering  companies to remedy earlier filter problems. Technical issues regarding  filters have been overcome by most leading companies in the filtering  space. Packet Sniffing     Content is delivered over the Internet in packets of information.  Each packet has the IP address of where it is going to, as well as the  IP address of where it has come from. Packet sniffing involves  examining the IP address of where the Content has originated. This  approach moves the point of filtering to the level of the router  offering increased speed and efficiency. There are several companies  that are developing packet-sniffer products at this time. Image recognition filtering     A handful of companies have produced filtering products that  examine images as they are delivered to a user. This is a relatively  recent approach, and relies on techniques such as the detection of skin  tones, or indeed on the analysis of images themselves. It is  computationally quite intensive, and computers will invariably  experience difficulty in distinguishing between art and pornography. A  photograph that is artistic in nature cannot be distinguished from that  of obscenity. These types of value judgments can only be made by human  review. Video and other streaming media further complicate the  filtering task by supplying a constant flow of images to be examined  for undesirable content.                   where does content filtering occur?     There are four technical components of filtering systems: browser- based, client-side software, proxy servers, and server-side filtering  servers.     No filter is foolproof. There are 146 filtering tools listed on the  popular website www.getnetwise.org. Each of these products essentially  falls into one of the categories below. It is important to note that no  filtering system is designed to work well in every application.     Some of the lower-end products would not be recommended for use in  schools and libraries because they lack the specific features that  educators need to create the best filtering scenario for their school,  library and for their community. Conversely, those products that are  used in the corporate space may need more flexibility of categories,  and schools & libraries might be only interested in blocking sites that  fall into the obscene, illegal and harmful to minors categories where  parents might have other desires.     Client-Side Software--This type of method is typically marketed at  the consumer level. Filtering can be implemented by placing a software  program on the end-user's computer. The software then runs while the  user is online, performing the particular filtering functions. Client- side software may require the end-user to configure the software and  download updated website lists.     The security loopholes with client-side software are a concern.  Many smart children can disable filtering software faster than a parent  or teacher can install it. In addition, there are quick and easy  programs written to disable the major companies' software with the  click of a mouse. These programs are circulated among children who  simply download it from the Internet, place it on a floppy disk, and  pass it around.     Proxy Servers--Filtering functionality can be removed from the end- user's computer and placed on a server somewhere else on the Internet,  called a proxy. With a proxy server, all website traffic must go from  the end-user's computer through the proxy server, then to the rest of  the Internet.     Proxy servers offer more security than client-side software. All  users must go through this proxy server to be able to access the  Internet ``proper''. To do so, the client is required to configure  their software to ``point to'' this proxy server to be able to access  Web pages and ftp files. a range of Internet-based Failure to do so  will result in blocked access to the Internet. A proxy filter can be  selective about what it blocks, and can be configured to block or  permit access to services.     Browser Settings--Filters using built-in browser settings typically  uses a ratings system. These systems are less intrusive but typically  less accurate.     Microsoft Internet Explorer provides content security settings for  the Internet Content Ratings Association's RSACi ratings, the most  popular ratings system on the market. However, if a site is not rated,  it is not accessible. Popular sites that are not rated include ESPN,  CNN, eBay, Amazon, and AOL. In fact, most sites are not rated, making  them inaccessible to the user.     Some filtering software ``decides'' what to block based on how a  site is rated--not entirely unlike the way parents use movie ratings.  This method offers fewer features and less precision compared to some  of the higher-end server-side products.     Hybrid Filters--There is a new filtering method that utilizes the  best features from each of the other methods. This hybrid system has  varying forms. S4F Technologies patent-pending system uses a server- side component that works in tandem with a thin client-side software  interface. By using more than one method, the user is able to take  advantage of the benefits of server-side filtering, including real-time  access to the most up-to-date database, the speed benefit and user- control features of client-side technology.               future advancements in filtering technology     Filtering technology providers have dedicated thousands of man- hours and millions of dollars in research and development to create  real solutions for schools, libraries, homes and businesses. At best,  the filtering industry is only 7 years old. The advancements in  technology over the past 2-3 years alone have brought about products  that combine artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms, intelligent  keyword databases, computer spidering technology, millions of websites  accurately categorized. All of this, while increasing speed, efficiency  and manageability through cutting edge system design and engineering.     Internet filtering is not foolproof. The dynamic of the Internet as  it relates to filtering can be likened to virus detection software.  Products in the virus detection industry use similar algorithms, they  monitor packets being transmitted over networks, and they have  extensive databases of known viruses and their signatures, yet these  virus detection tools are not fool-proof, still network administrators  world-wide use these programs to protect their networks because that  can offer a high level of protection, even if it is not 100%.     It seems that the opponents of filtering technology wish to cast  down the use of any filtering software because it might only be 95-99%  effective. Opponents are trying to hold filtering software to a higher  standard than other types of similar and related products. Windows and  Macintosh operating systems, Internet dial-up connections, computer  manufacturers and virtually any software application manufacturer all  create and sell products that are not fool-proof and error free. That  is why software companies continue to release updates and create new  versions, to keep up with the ever-changing marketplace. It is an  acceptable part of the computer industry.     Future filtering technology advancements will see the convergence  of several of the approaches reviewed.                are there other alternatives to filtering?     Some of the opponents of the Children's Internet Protection Act  have suggested that filtering is not necessary; rather, a strong  education program that trains children how to have a positive Internet  experience is all that is needed.     Although I feel that education is a great way to teach children  about the dangers of the Internet, it is surely no replacement for  technology protection measures. The biggest problem is that much of the  pornographic and illegal exposure to minors is accidental. The National  Center For Missing and Exploited Children released a study where 1 in 4  minors reported viewing of unwanted material. It is a well-known fact  that in an effort to increase viewer ship, operators of obscenity  websites will use unrelated keywords and misleading URL's to attract  unsuspecting users to their site. Once the image is viewed, the damage  is done and the law has been broken. All the education in the world  cannot stop that from happening.     To illustrate this erroneous argument, consider drivers education.  Millions of teenagers and adults each year take some form of driver's  education or training. Yet the government has put seatbelt laws in  place to protect people from harm. All the driver's education in the  world cannot stop accidents from happening. Seat belt laws do not  guarantee to protect the passenger 100% of the time, in the same way  that Internet filters cannot ever guarantee 100% perfect performance,  yet they are a great tool to divert the vast majority of Internet abuse  in schools and libraries.     Monitoring has been considered as an alternative to filtering. This  approach places the burden of policing the Internet on educators and  librarians who cannot possibly mange the activities of every Internet  user. Once again, if sites are accidentally seen, the damage has been  done.  can existing technology protection measures meet the requirements of                  the children's internet protection act?     The answer is a resounding yes. The Children's Internet Protection  Act requires that a school or library select a technology protection  measure, which they choose, not the government through a public hearing  and the creation of an Internet safety policy. The local board  determines what to block based upon Federal and state laws as well as  local community standards.     This law encourages public education and empowers consumers and  local authorities to work together to create a solution that is right  for everyone. Schools and libraries have the affirmative duty to  protect minors while in their custody. Using technology protection  measures shows that educators are taking reasonable steps to protect  their kids. Effective filtering technology exists and is effective.     The leading filtering products in the educational space already  have the necessary functionality to meet the requirements of the law.  Here is a profile of those products:        CIPA related features comparison of the most popular filters in public schools and public libraries.

Page 19.              evidence of librarian satisfaction with filters Statistics show a dramatic increase in filter use in libraries.     A new study \1\ by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and  Information Science shows a dramatic increase in the number of Public  Libraries using Internet filters. In 1998, just 1,679 public libraries  offering public Internet access filtered some or all Internet  access.\2\ In 2000, that number more than doubled to 3,711,\3\  representing an increase of 121%. One in four Public Libraries offering public Internet access now use          filters.     Overall, 24.6% of Public Libraries offering public Internet access  use filtering on some or all terminals.\4\ This percentage represents  an increase from 14.6% in 1998.\5\ The fact that the number of  Libraries filtering has more than doubled, while the overall percentage  of Libraries filtering has not doubled is explained by the fact that  the total population of Libraries offering public Internet access has  increased from 11,519 in 1998 \6\ to 15,128 in 2000.\7\     The most dramatic gains came in Libraries filtering some Internet  access, which increased from 801 or 7.0% in 1998,\8\ to 2,265 or 15.0%  in 2000 \9\. Data from this study indicate that there has been a 65%  increase in Public Libraries filtering all public Internet access since  1998. The number of Libraries that filter all access has climbed from  878 or 7.6% in 1998,\10\ to 1,446 or 9.6%.\11\ Nearly 1,500 public  libraries (one out of every ten) filter all access today. A Survey shows that librarians and teachers are highly satisfied with          filters.     In April-May of 2000, respected library researcher Dr. Ken Haycock  conducted a survey of school librarians and public librarians on the  use of filtering software, for the magazine School Library Journal, a  publication of Cahners Research.\12\     An astonishing 90% of public librarians who used filters responded  that ``the software serves its purpose'' either ``very well'' or  ``somewhat well''.\13\     The study asked both school and public librarians who used filters  to rate their level of satisfaction with filtering software in several  ways.

Called I-Gear, the application          is produced by Symantec Corp., maker of Norton AntiVirus          software. I-Gear resides on the computer server, rather than on          individual PCs, and Sumler said it allows librarians to set a          variety of levels for blocking Web sites.           She said that if a patron complains that the technology is          blocking a legitimate site, librarians easily can override the          controls. ``If there are complaints, librarians are to deal          with them right away,'' Sumler said. ``We don't want to deny          access.'' . . . ``We think this works for us,'' she said.\16\ David C. Ruff, executive director of the Rolling Meadows (IL) Library:           Expanding the filtering technology to block obscenity and          pornography on the library's 20 public computers was based on          the library's satisfaction with the Cyber Patrol software and          the desire to simplify some administrative procedures, said          David C. Ruff, the library's executive director . . . In the          week since the filtering policy was expanded, patrons have not          noticed the difference, Ruff said.\17\ Joan Adams, director of the Jefferson Parish (LA) Public Libraries:           After several months of wrangling with software companies,          parish officials on Thursday finally finished installing          filtering software on about 100 computers, cementing the Parish          Council's promise to do what it legally can to keep perverts          and smut out of public libraries. But for most computer users          who sat quietly pecking away at their keyboards, the added          restrictions were hardly detectable . . . ``I've gotten a lot          of `what if?' questions from the librarians,'' [Library          Director Joan] Adams said. ``But the average computer user          doesn't even notice it is there.''           So far, the WebSense software does not seem to be slowing          down the speed of library computers, a common side effect to          installing filtering software, library network administrator          Dwight Bluford said. The software program also seems to be          fairly on target with the sites it blocks. That's because          WebSense searches the content of Internet Web sites to          determine if there is offensive content, not the keywords, he          said. ``It seems to be working well,'' Bluford said. And          because it can be locally manipulated, ``we also have the          ability to immediately block a site if we get a complaint from          a patron, or to unblock a legitimate site if it is blocked.''          \18\ Library patrons and staff at the Plano (TX) Public Library:           James Engelbrecht wasn't too happy when Plano libraries were          compelled to install Internet filtering software on their          computers late last year. Because he doesn't have Internet          access at home, Mr. Engelbrecht uses the computers at the          L.E.R. Schimelpfenig and Maribelle M. Davis libraries about          twice a week. ``When it was first implemented, I wasn't crazy          about it,'' Mr. Engelbrecht said of the filtering policy. ``I          thought it was another bureaucratic layer.'' To his surprise,          the BESS filtering software hasn't impeded his ability to          navigate his way around cyberspace. ``It's not burdensome,'' he          said. ``If I do find a site blocked, I can ask to use an          unfiltered computer.'' While the controversial policy was          debated for a year before it was launched in December, its          implementation appears to have been fairly undramatic.\19\ Erin Noll Halovanic, Information Systems Librarian at Kenton County          (KY) Library:           Halovanic says if a customer complains about not being able          to access a site that's supposedly suitable, she reviews it on          an unfiltered staff PC and unblocks the site if she finds it          appropriate for the library. And that seems to be a good          compromise for Halovanic who admits, ``As a librarian,          filtering absolutely curdles my blood. It goes against my          training as a librarian and my belief in librarianship.          However, when it comes to the choice between pandering sexual          materials and between protecting people's personal rights, I          choose filtering over the alternative.'' \20\ Margaret Barnes, Director, Dallas (OR) Public Library:           After much conversation and serious reflection, it was          determined that a workable approach, enabling the Dallas          Library to furnish access to the public, would be the          installation of a filter system on all public Internet stations          . . . During the almost 1\1/2\ years that we have been          providing this service we have had no one formally or really          informally register an objection about a filter system being in          place on the workstations. We have received countless positive          comments about this service from all ages in our community.\21\ Judith Drescher, Director Memphis-Shelby County (TN)Library:           The library system's switch to pornography-blocking software          has gone so smoothly that it could be considered a nonevent.          The Memphis area's chief librarian, Judith Drescher, told a          Shelby County Commission committee Wednesday that more than          half the 26 public queries about blocking software had nothing          to do with the new software . . . In a report given to the          commission's education and libraries committee, Drescher          stated, ``Since installation, the library has received no          requests from the public to review and block a site. Library          staff has submitted five sites for review, all of which were          blocked.'' \22\                    Footnotes for Survey and Quotations      \1\ PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND THE INTERNET 2000: SUMMARY FINDINGS AND  DATA TABLES.

Mr. Upton. Right on the money. Thank you. It was exactly 5  minutes. Good work, Mr. Largent. You were always one that could  work the clock in the inbounds line. Ms. Morgan, you heard me  describe a little bit about the Kalamazoo library situation,  where they monitor, and you have to have an access card to be  able to use the equipment, and it seems to work based on the  numbers that they have suggested to me. Does the Chicago  library system have anything like that?     Ms. Morgan. No. And actually the system that you described  sounds very good, but I think you also mentioned when you were  describing that that there are policies and situations very  widely throughout the country, and I think that's why this law  is so good, because it evens the playing field.     It says that this is a standard that we want in our schools  and libraries, and it is a standard that we need to support and  promote. There are just far too many situations and libraries,  and there are stories all across the country of very  unacceptable things happening.     And again, you described something that is fairly optimal,  where you have the access card for the child, et cetera. Many  libraries don't have that. We certainly don't have that.     Mr. Upton. In your written testimony, you cited a May 2000  news article which discussed the Chicago Libraries  Commissioner's view on Internet use in the Chicago public  library, and that article stated, and I quote, in the adult  areas of the library, patrons are free to view anything,  including pornographic sites. The Commissioner--and I presume  your boss----     Ms. Morgan. The big boss, yes.     Mr. Upton. The big boss, Ms. Dempsey, further states,  ``Adults have a right to look at those things. Adult terminals  have privacy screens if they want to look at it. That's fine.  But you don't have to look at it, and I don't have to look at  it. People are free to surf. We are a big city with 3 million  people. What is objectionable to one is not objectionable to  another.''     Ms. Caywood, does the American Library Association stand  behind the Chicago Public Library Administrator's position,  that anything should go for adult Internet users in publicly  funded libraries?     Ms. Caywood. I am a member of the American Library  Association. We believe in abiding by the law. As Mr. Taylor  pointed out, there are laws that make certain things illegal. I  can't speak for every librarian, but I prosecute. I have  prosecuted and I will when people break the law.     Mr. Upton. Now, you in your library in Virginia Beach, you  indicated in your testimony that you block chats?     Ms. Caywood. Yes.     Mr. Upton. Do you have a system like I described that we  have in Kalamazoo?     Ms. Caywood. Our solution is considerably different from  Kalamazoo's. It is a different community. For example, Virginia  Beach is a resort area. One of our big sources of income is  tourism, and we would be involved in an endless issuing of  little cards if we tried to make a system that was card  controlled, and yet accessible to people who wanted to e-mail  back home.     What we do is we provide choices. We encourage families to  visit the library together and on the whole they do. And they  choose what they need at that moment, and it works for them.     Mr. Upton. You know, as I look at this issue, and as I look  back at the debate and the work by folks like Mr. Largent and  Mr. Pickering, and Members of the Senate as well, there is an  analogy that I take a look at, and that is the old debate that  we once had with the National Endowment of the Arts, a  federally taxpayer subsidy.     And it points certainly in the late 1980's, and the early  1990's, there were a number of graphic or pornographic events  that they funded in a number of ways that alarmed most Members  of Congress on both sides of the aisle.     And to his credit, a Member from Michigan, Paul Henry, took  up the cause as a member of the then Education and Workforce  Committee, and in fact indicated that for dollars to go in the  future to fund the arts community. In fact, they would have to  su"

GX253-08-3922955	"Contact: Andy Davis, (202) 224-6654 http://hollings.senate.gov  Floor Speech by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings On Trade, Manufacturing and the Loss of U.S. Jobs July 31, 2003 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is somewhat out of order when I make comments on trade in that the distinguished majority leader says he wants to do energy, he wants to do judges, he wants to do the supplemental, and he wants to do trade. I talked to him earlier this morning, and I said: I would be glad to fill in at any time they have a lapse. He said: Well, it wouldn't be until tomorrow. Then later in the exchange--there has been an intramural all morning long on procedures--he said: Perhaps on Saturday. So I thought once the Pastore rule had been complied with and rule 19(1)(b), the three hours had been completed--the distinguished former leader, the Senator from West Virginia, and I are the only two that remember the Pastore rule. Now that I have the floor, I have time to comment in a deliberate fashion. And while my distinguished former chairman and now ranking member of the Finance Committee is on the floor, since I am talking about trade, I want to express a frustration and make this observation. The main problem we have is how to pay our bills. The President has just put out a budget deficit projection of just a $455 billion deficit. That is on page 1 of his report. But on page 57 of the report, you will see the deficit will really reach $698 billion this year. As of this minute, the public debt to the penny is $503 billion. But second to that particular problem is the matter before us of jobs, economic strength, and manufacturing capacity. I will never forget Akio Morita, former chairman of the board of Sony. Morita was visiting Chicago, and lecturing about Third World countries. And he admonished that a Third World country had to develop a strong manufacturing capacity in order to become a nation state. And later on, he diverted and pointed and said to me about the United States: That world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power. At the end of World War II, we had 40 percent of the workforce of America engaged in production manufacturing. Now we are down to 11.2 percent, and soon it will be 10 percent. So as a result of the scheme, I should call it, of the Finance Committee, we will have 10 percent of Americans working, and the other 90 percent eating or talking about it. And I hear these big   voices around saying: World power, we are the only world. We are not a world power. No, no. We are in a very weakened position. Right to the point, when I came to the Senate I got on the Commerce Committee. I had practiced customs law. I thought I was getting into trade because the Commerce Committee used to be the Committee of Foreign Commerce. Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the Congress of the United States shall regulate foreign commerce--not the President, not fast track, not some wavering trade minister running around Doha saying he is going to do away with dumping laws-but the Congress. And I found out that my distinguished chairman, Senator Magnuson at the time, was interested in exports, since he represented Boeing. Foreign commerce had reverted over to the Finance Committee. They had the reciprocal trade agreement. They had the Special Trade Representative. And indirectly, I became a sort of a study of the Finance Committee. I had a fellow named Claude Wilde from Texas come up to me, when I was just a freshman Senator. I was taken to the third floor of the old Statler Hilton. And he said: Yes, we are going to get rid of that fellow Yarborough. We are going to get that fellow Bentsen up here because he is better on oil. I said: On oil? He said: Oh, yes, that Finance Committee, we oil boys run it. We look out for oil. So the farmers are smarter than the oil boys. They have moved in with the Senator from Montana and the Senator from North Dakota and all the rest of them. I notice my distinguished ranking member. He put out a complaint to the WTO on agriculture. I have lost 61,000 textile jobs since he proposed NAFTA. He didn't ask the WTO about the special provisions for textiles. But he wants to petition. He immediately becomes alert. I have had to fight agriculture, I have had to fight the oil boys, I have had to fight that Finance Committee to sober up this Congress and let us go to work on producing jobs. The policy at this minute is to export jobs, eliminate jobs, get rid of all jobs--not just textile, not just hard manufacture, not just service jobs, not just high-tech jobs, but all jobs, except politicians and the press. If we started importing politicians and press, I believe we would finally stop, look, and listen, and we would begin to understand the problem. We have to struggle in order to debate trade as a result. It is easy to fix the Finance Committee-and they are fixed. They get their little amendments in there, and everything else like that. I am ready to vote for the Chile trade agreement. I have been saying that for 5 years, except they put on immigration. Mr. BAUCUS. We didn't. Mr. HOLLINGS. You didn't, but you didn't knock it off. They had a vote 3 years ago on the H-   1B visas, with that Silicon Valley crowd. They wanted to get all the Indians and Chinese cheaper, and bring them in to take American jobs. The vote was 99 to 1. I was the one against that immigration. I am against this immigration, and if you didn't have fast track, Mr. President, I could put up a little amendment, like any Senator, and we would have the normal process, and we would have an up-or-down vote, and I probably could pass it. I notice, on the other side of the aisle, some Republican colleagues are concerned about the immigration provision. Chile is better than us. Chile has a free market economy; they have labor laws; they have environmental laws; they have a respected judiciary; they have a balanced budget. Even when they brought up NAFTA, I said, why not Australia? They are the best friend we have; they immediately supported us in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Vietnam, and in Korea--the best friend we have and we don't have a free trade agreement with them. Now they want us to have a free trade agreement with a corporate state, Singapore. I said long ago I could compete with any company in Japan, but I could not compete with the country of Japan. So here I am being asked to give the country, which is really a corporate State, free trade status. The government of Singapore owns the port; shipping and logistics; property; the airlines, telecom, medi a, bank in g, and fin ancing services in du st ries; p owers, ut il it ies, techno lo gy, engineering, and the rail. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follow s: State-Owned Corporations in Singapore Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that is a corporate state. There isn't any question that what we have here is a loading dock, a veritable loading dock from Indonesia. Let me read this. Here is a headline: Officials tout manufacturing services benefits from U.S.-Singapore FTA. U.S. Ambassador to Singapore Frank Lavin this week said the greatest economic benefits to U.S. companies from the recently-concluded U.S.-Singapore free trade agreement would come in the areas of financial services, intellectual property and manufacturing in the electronics sector. Lavin said that in the long run, the ``most significant aspect of this FTA'' could be provisions allowing products assembled in the two Indonesian out-islands to be counted as Singaporean in origin for the purposes of the FTA. That would allow U.S. electronics manufacturers to take advantage of low wage rates on those islands to assemble components from Singapore into electronic products that can enter the U.S. duty free, Lavin said. Mr. President, where are we? Here we are trying to create jobs, and our good friend, Don Evans, the Secretary of Commerce, is running all over, jobs and growth, jobs and growth, jobs and growth, and we will give you a tax cut, jobs and growth as if that's going to help.   My distinguished friend on the House side--the smartest fellow perhaps in the Congress is JOHN SPRATT from South Carolina, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. He voted for NAFTA. I said, JOHN, for Heaven's sake how could you? And he said he had a promise that we can get 500 additional Customs agents. He said we need them badly, and he was right. We needed them badly. We never got the 500 Customs agents. They keep cutting that budget particularly. They need help. In Charleston, we have to lend the local sheriff's sniffing dog to the Customs agents. My office is in the Customs building. I keep up with them and I know what is going on down there. Mauritius, the little island off the coast of Africa, was inundating us with imported textiles, but they didn't have a textile plant. It was all made in China, and coming through Africa to South Carolina. These transshipments, Customs people will tell you, are to the tune of $5 billion. When you go to them and ask them, wait a minute, can't you enforce the law, they say: Senator, you want me to enforce the law now on terrorism or textiles? I said: Heavens, no, on terrorism. Do you want me to enforce the law on drugs or textiles? Oh, no, I want you to enforce the law on drugs. So we have lost 61,000 textile jobs, and who is leading the way? The Department of State is leading the way in Singapore. I hate to say that about Singapore because I have visited there and I hav e th e great est res pec t fo r an ybod y in t he Far E ast , sp eci fic all y the for mer Pri me M inister , Le Quan Yu. As a young Senator, in the early 1970s, I went there and Senator Mansfield, the majority leader, said: Fritz, you have to call on him. He is the wise man of the East. I had the most interesting conversation just the year before last. I called on him again, with the distinguished chairman of the then Intelligence Committee, Senator Shelby, because I wanted the Prime Minister to relate a particular observation he had made to me back then with respect to the defenses and the concerns we had in the Far East, which is another subject for debate. I was prepared to vote for Singapore. But we got fast track. With fast track you cannot say anything; you cannot do anything. You have to disrupt the Senate, in the middle of the energy debate, to be heard. We have fast track on jobs in America. We fast track jobs offshore--that is what it is. If we did not have fast track, I could put up a little amendment to strike the provision in the Singapore agreement that they couldn't have transshipments from the Malaysian Islands. This will just open the door for everything in the Malaysian Islands to come through Singapore. Listen to what the State Department ambassador said: With fast track, you have to disrupt the orderliness of business around here. I apologize to both leaders who have had a very difficult time getting business back on track today, but, Mr. President, I can tell you now, I do not apologize to anybody about the importance of this particular subject. It is not discussed, it is not debated, and it is not considered. It is fixed.   I know something about trial lawyers, and I have seen some fixed juries that I have had to go up against. If there has ever been a fixed jury, it is this U.S. Congress. And I do not speak in a partisan fashion. I remember NAFTA. We had that beat until President Clinton went out and picked up 23 votes. He gave a golf round here for this particular Congressman, a golf round there. Jake Pickle, the Congressman from Texas, my good friend, got a cultural center. Another Congressman down in Texas got two C-17s. Oh, yes, the White House has the power. I do not speak loosely or lightly. I speak authoritatively. It has been reported in the press. They fixed the vote. This vote was already fixed, unbeknownst to the members of the Finance Committee, so that when the treaties got here, they found this hidden provision on immigration and we cannot vote on it. Finally, they put in a provision with respect to the transshipments to Singapore, and we cannot amend it. So the Senator from South Carolina under fast track is forbidden from voting his will with respect to these particular trade agreements. I am really worried. I just mentioned to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia about production in this country. I go right back to Morita. We were talking about manufacturing. That has been the strength of Japan. It is now the unquestioned strength of China. We think we are strong. We passed a resolution in the United Nations at the end of the eighties for the General Assembly to have hearings on human rights in China. China went around us, to the leadership in Africa, in the Philippines, in Malaysia, in Australia, and in New Zealand. They picked up the votes, and we never had a hearing on human rights, even though we had it adopted in that particular committee. One can say un der dom esti c pol it ics, it 's th e econo my, st up id ; o ne can s ay und er foreign p ol icy, it's the economy, stupid, because it is the economic strength of our Nation that is in question here. I just finished reading a book, ``An Army at Dawn'' by Rick Atkinson. He reminded me of the strength we had in World War II and how we really won that war. I have been on several panels, having been a 3-year veteran starting out in Africa and ending up on V-E Day in Austria. As much as anyone, Rosie the Riveter won that war. I hope in this big ceremony they have for World War II that they will have a statue for Rosie the Riveter because I can tell you right now, it was the American production that won that war. As has been said, we did not defeat the Germans in North Africa, we overwhelmed them because we had that kind of production. As I said earlier, at the end of World War II, we had 40 percent of our workforce in manufacturing, in production. As of yesterday afternoon, my check showed it was 11.2 percent, and we are going to get new figures on Friday, and probably it will be down some more. For the last 3 years the manufacturing strength and economy of the United States has diminished. What happens is, we have 10 percent of the people producing and we have 90 percent of the people eati ng and t alki ng abou t i t. That is no t a coun try. Le t's not run aroun d h ere abo ut energy, and run around here about judges, and run around here about supplemental bills, and whatever   else. Let's sober up and start rebuilding this country, rebuilding jobs, and quit exporting them. Let's put a tourniquet on this outflow hemorrhage of jobs to any and everywhere but the United States. We have a 6.5 percent unemployment rate. The real unemployment rate is not just the 6.5 percent. Mr. President, there are those who have not applied, so it is a real unemployment rate of some 10 percent. My colleagues can see why I am worried when we see ``The Jobless and Hopeless May Quit the Labor Force.'' That is how we get to 10 percent. This is another Times article dated April 26. Mr. President, if you think I am worried, let's go to Mort Zuckerman, the editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report. I quote: The statistics are enough to make an incumbent assume the fetal position: 2.7 million fewer private-sector jobs than two years ago; the longest decline (32 months) in industrial employment since the Great Depression: the longest continuous decline in jobs in more than 50 years. Making matters worse, the stock market has been off by double digits for three years in a row. That's the first time that happened since the 1930s. The markets' plunge wiped out over $5 trillion in value, including the retirement savings of millions of Americans. As if all that were not enough, the $5.6 trillion Federal surplus we saw during the 1990s has been turned upside down into an estimated $4 trillion deficit. Business activity is as weak as it has ever been outside of a recession, and we do not know whether this signals the onset of another recession, the dreaded double dip. That is Mort Zuckerman. Some might say, HOLLINGS, you are all wound up about Texas. I am not wound up about Texas. I am wound up about the country. We are in the worst shape I have ever seen, and they are running around here with tax cuts for jobs and growth. We have lost 2 million jobs since we passed the tax cut. We have lost 2.7 million since President Bush has taken office, according to Mr. Zuckerman. The Wall Street Journal on July 21: ``Laid Off Factory Workers Find Jobs Are Drying Up For Good. '' I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follow s: ""Laid-Off Factory Workers Find Jobs are Drying Up for Good,"" Wall Street Journal, July 21, 2003, by Clare Ansberry   Mr. HOLLINGS. I picked up my August 4 issue of Time magazine: ``Where The Good Jobs Are Going. Forget Sweatshops. U.S. companies are now shifting high-wage work overseas, especi ally to Indi a.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: ""Where the Good Jobs Are Going; Forget Sweatshops, U.S. Companies Are Now Shifting High-Wage Work Overseas, Especially to India,"" Time Magazine, Aug. 4, 2003, by Jyoti Thottam with Sean Gregory Mr. HOLLINGS. What happens is that when we used to argue for manufacturing jobs, they said, oh, don't worry, the service economy will produce jobs. Then when the service economy was leaving, they said high tech, will be the motor of growth. Then there was Y2K, that was to be the next motor of growth. The high-tech jobs are gone. The service jobs are gone. As they told England at the end of World War II, do not worry, instead of a nation of bronze, you are going to be a nation of brains; instead of providing products, you are going to provide services; instead of creating wealth, you are going to handle it and be a financial center. Of course, England has gone to economic hell in a hand basket. Downtown London is an amusement park. Let's not go that way. We have to produce. As they crown the queens and bring out the kings and everything else of that kind, we are in a position where we do not make anything anymore. For example, footwear, 83.6 percent of our shoes are imported; 70 percent of our clothing is imported. Ceramic household articles, 87 percent is gone; cooking and kitchen-ware, gone. And I can read on and on, right on down the line. I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follow s: IMPORT PENETRATION CHART Mr. HOLLINGS. We do not make anything anymore. We are just jabbering to each other. We are not producing. The Secretary of Commerce is burdened with the duty--and the current occupant of the chair would be interested in this--of listing some 500 critical articles to our national security for defense purposes. We have a $5 billion deficit in the balance of trade. We had to wait 5 months before we went into Desert Storm to get mainframes from the Japanese. Now we have to go to other countries before we can go to war. We do not make those things anymore. We have an   advanced technology of a $2 billion a month deficit in the balance of trade, over $24 billion a year, in advanced technology. The Japanese have given up. They moved their advanced technology and research to Shanghai. The most modern automotive research is in downtown Shanghai. General Motors put it there. We can go right on down the list. The Chinese are saying before anyone can come with factories, they have to bring their research. The technol ogy comm un it y of th e Uni ted S tates i s con cerned abou t o ur techno lo gical capabil it y. We do not have as many Americans engineers as there are in China. We maintain our security by a superiority of technology, and we are draining the tub of technology just as fast as we can. Yet in this Chamber, we want to talk about an Energy bill, want to talk about a judge--don't we want to talk about trade? Put fast track on the Energy bill. Why not? Unless, by gosh, we get serious and start talking about jobs in America, the economic strength, the industrial backbone of this Nation. Tax cuts Carolina America have lost America loses jobs. Free trade loses jobs. We have a race to the bottom to Mexico. In South we have lost 61,000 jobs--incidentally, we were supposed to get 200,000 jobs in by signing NAFTA. That is what NAFTA was going to create for us. Nationally, we 450,000 jobs to Mexico, but not for long because those same Mexican jobs formerly in are now going to China.  It is different than what Henry Ford said. Henry Ford said, I want the man making that automobile to be able to buy it. He produced a minimum wage and he produced health benefits. So we built up middle America. Now, instead, with a trade policy of free trade, like monkeys on a string, there is no such thing as free trade. That is an oxymoron. Trade is something for something. If it is free, it is a gift. But with that particular policy, we have to race to the bottom in the United States of America. I have an article from the New York Times, July 20, that I wanted to read, which points out our tremendous difficulty. I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follow s: ""Economic View: Producing Abroad Is Harming Recovery,"" New York Times, July 20, 2003, By Louis Uchitelle Mr. HOLLINGS. Of particular significance, the article quotes Steven Roach, the chief economist of Morgan Stanley. He finds that China's total exports have tripled since 1994, that 65 percent of the $244 billion increase comes from foreign companies in China, most of them United States. Then I want you to listen to this economist about the economy, Mr. Mark M. Xanely. Before I quote him, let me say I am not an economist but I finally found one that is going to correct Alan Greenspan, because Mr. Greenspan is looking to consumer demand.   But before you can have consumer demand, you have to have consumers. Before you have consumers, you have to have producers. Before you have producers, you have to have jobs. Here is what he says: For starters, the forecasters seemed not to grasp how much the American economy has deviated from the standard business cycle and the standard cures. A major reason for the deviation is the mobility of American companies, particularly the ease with which they now shift operations to China and India. The wholesale movement of jobs and production overseas is handcuffing the recovery. Why do they have a jobless recovery? Because the economy of the United States is handcuffed with this silly cutting of the taxes, jobs and growth, jobs and growth, free trade, free trade, free trade. Maybe it is not jobless growth, it is just jobless in the United States. This tax incentive, this stimulation is not going to create jobs in downtown Nashville, TN. The jobs will be in Shanghai, China. If you are in Nashville, TN, and you get a good fat tax break, the question arises, should you build the plant in Nashville? No, your competition has gone to China. If you are going to meet the competition, you are going to have to put that new plant, use that tax break, that stimulation--not to invest in the United States but to invest in China. We are missing the point of history when everyone talks of this free trade nonsense. I remind them of Alexander Hamilton, a good Republican. Some of them want to replace him with the inventor of voodoo I, Ronald Reagan, on the $10 bill. You got some crazy things going on in this town. Imagine putting Ronald Reagan on the $10 bill rather than Alexander Hamilton--one of the greatest of the great. Hamilton not only helped with the Constitution, not only helped Madison with the Federalist Papers, but created a ``Report on Manufacturers.'' I have it right here. What happened was the fledgling colony had just won its freedom when the British corresponded with us back in New York, because that is where the Capitol was at the time. They said what you ought to do back in the colonies since you won your freedom, was to trade with us what you produce best and we will trade back with you what we produce best. The doctrine was David Ricardo's, the economic doctrine of comparative advantage. It was Alexander Hamilton who won out. He even persuaded Madison, who voted for it. He issued the ``Report on Manufacturers.'' It is too long to include in the RECORD. The original copy is at the Library of Congress. It can be expressed in one expression: Hamilton told the British to bug off. We are not going to remain your colony, shipping to you our agriculture, our foodstuffs, our rice, our cotton, our indigo, our coal, our iron ore. We are not going to remain a colony; no, we will become a nation state. The first bill to ever pass Congress was for the seal of the United States--but the second bill on July 4, 1789, that passed this Congress was protectionism, a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 articles. We built this country over a 160-year-period with protectionism. I will never forget, every time   they would tell me: Senator, you are nothing but a protectionist. I am for free trade, free trade. The opponents do not know what the heck they are talking about. I feel sorry for them. Protectionism built the country. We did not even have the income tax until 1913. We built it on tariffs. After Hamilton came Lincoln. People told Lincoln that to build the transcontinental rail we ought to get steel from England. The father of the Republican Party said: No, no. We are going to build our own steel mills and when we get through we will not only have the rail equipment, we will have our steel production. Then Roosevelt in the depth of the Depression protected agriculture. People do not think I know anything about farming. But I get the farm vote every time I run. I love campaigning out in Iowa. I can tell you right now Roosevelt protected agriculture. And Eisenhower protected oil in the 1950s with quotas. We built the country with protectionism. I will never forget when we had to have President Reagan's second inauguration right out here in the Rotunda. He raised his hand and he said, ``preserve, protect and defend.'' Then we came back here and we debated something on trade. I said something about protection and the majority jumped all over me: You are a protectionist, protectionist. We have the Army to protect us when the enemy is out. We have Social Security to protect us from old age. We have Medicare to protect us from ill health. We have environmental laws, clean air and clean water, to protect the environment. The fundamental foundation of government is to protect. Let's say you wanted to start an Alexander Manufacture Company. But before you can open Alexander Manufacture, you have to have a minimum wage. You have to have clean air; you have to have clean water; you have to have Social Security; you have to have Medicare; you have to have Medicaid; you have to have safe machinery; you have to have a safe working place; you have OSHA coming around looking at you; you have to have plant closing notice; you have to have parental leave. I could go on and on. Or you can open a plant in China for 60 cents an hour, and have none of that. So companies go to China. I will never forget, I had a friend who organized his own company out in California. I saw where he was very successful and I said: I helped you. I got your water and sewer lines when you came to South Carolina, when you had an expansion. I want you to give us that plant in South Carolina. He said: I don't build anything in the United States. He said: I do it in China. I got research, I got sales--for 10 percent of the costs. He did not say this but I know it: They build the factory. They provide the employment. They give people a year-to-year contract. They don't have to worry about the cycle that the economists talk about. If the cycle goes down, they do not have to renew the contract next year. They cannot lose. We are in one dickens of a fix.   I was reading the book ``Theodore Rex,'' the patron saint of my Republican friends. He is one of my heroes, too. In the book, on page 20, let me read at the turn of the century what we really had was protectionism. The United States was already so rich in goods and services that she was more self-sustaining than any industrial power in history. Indeed, it could consume only a fraction of what it produced. The rest went overseas at prices other exporters found hard to match. As Andrew Carnegie said: The nation that makes the cheapest steel has other nations at its feet. More than half the world's cotton, corn, copper and oil flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one-third of all steel, iron, silver and gold. Even if the United States were not so blessed with raw materials, the excellence of her manufactured products guaranteed her dominance of world markets. Current advertisements in British magazines gave the impression that the typical Englishman waked to the ring of an Ingersoll alarm, shaved with a Gillette razor, combed his hair with Vaseline tonic, buttoned his Arrow shirt, hurried downstairs for Quaker Oats, California figs, Maxwell House coffee, commuted in a Westinghouse tram, body by Fisher, rose to his office in an Otis elevator, worked all day with his Waterman pen under the efficient glare of Edison lightbulbs. ``It only remains,'' one Fleet Street wag suggested, ``for us to take Ameri can coa l to N ewcast le.'' Behi nd th e jok e lay real con cerns. The Uni ted S tates was already su pp lyi ng beer to Germany, pottery to Bohemia, oranges to Valencia. As a result of this billowing surge in productivity, Wall Street was awash with foreign capital. Carnegie calculated that America could afford to buy the entire United Kingdom and settle Britain's national debt into the bargain. For the first time in history, transatlantic money currents were thrusting more powerfully westward than east. Even the Bank of England had begun to borrow money on Wall Street. New York City seemed deemed to replace London as the world's financial center. Mr. Pre siden t, you can s ee exactl y what happ ened. W e bu ilt it up. A t the e nd o f Worl d War II, my dear friends, we had the only economy. In order to prosper, we had to spread prosperity. The way we did that was very sanguine: the Marshall plan. And it worked. We sent over money, 80some billion in today's dollars. We sent over the equipment, the finest machine tools, automotive equipment and otherwise. We sent over the expertise, and we rebuilt Europe, we rebuilt the Pacific rim, and capitalism defeated communism. It worked. Our trouble is it worked too well for these eager-beaver manufacturers. I remember them well because I have been in this thing, now, for 50-some years. I can see them--Oh, I get jet lag; I hate to go; oh, man, I don't want to go; and everything else of that kind. No more, not with the executive to Shanghai happening daily. You Avenue in New York computer, not with the Internet. You can send some young, aggressive to run your plant. You can set it up on your computer. You can see what is can be in touch on the Internet. You can run it from the 32nd floor on Sixth and, man, you have it made. And they are all doing it.   So what happened with the Marshall plan? We not only spread that prosperity but we really taught these people a bad lesson because they don't think about the country. You know, you and I are supposed to think about the country. They are supposed to think about profits. They do not have a duty. Of course, being Americans, you would think they would be a little bit more patriotic. Their organizations are against us. Now who is the enemy? in other words. The toast of the town, Jack Welsh of GE, he believed in squeezing the lemon. This says: One of General Electric's CEO's, Jack Welsh's favorite phrase is ``squeeze the lemon'' for wringing out the cost. To help them meet the stiff goals, several of GE's business units, including aircraft engines, power systems, industrial systems, have been prodding suppliers to move to low-cost Mexico where the industrial giant already employs 30,000. That was 4 years ago. GE even puts on supplier migration conferences to help them make the leap. He goes on: Welsh's widely admired status in corporate America has lent legitimacy to a model of business success that is built on job and wage cuts. This is Business Week. This is the bible of the business community, the weekly bible. Here it is, and I am quoting: The internal report, a copy of which Business Week obtained, says: ``GE set the tone early and succinctly: `Migrate or be out of business; not a matter of if, just when'. This is not a seminar just to pro vide i nform ation . We ex pect you t o mov e and m ove qu ickly.'' The followup: Even though GE's profits were up 80 percent at that particular time, they wanted more. You know, they are not just Jesse Jackson in civil rights. This is Jack Welsh in Business Leadership: I want it all. My time has come. I want it all. So the 80 percent didn't suit him. But you don't jump on poor Jack; he has gone now, and he has had other troubles. Let's go to last month. General Motors and Ford: Automotive News. I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: ""Ford, GM Push Vendors Toward China: `World Price' Frenzy Threatens U.S. Jobs,"" Automotive News, June 23, 2003, by Robert Sherefkin, David Sedgwick   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, just this last month: Ford Motor Company and General Motors are pressuring their North American suppliers to great migration in China. Embroiled in a price war with their foreign rivals, Ford and GM have delivered an ultimatum. Suppliers must match a world price that is increasingly set in China, or they must build factories in China. How do you like that? That is not textiles, that is the automotive backbone of the United States of America. I voted for the Chrysler bailout, so now Daimler can own them. The foreigners own all the foodstuffs. They are going to have all the banks. Now they are going to have all the automobile business. I wish Don Evans was up in Michigan. He would tell them you get a tax cut, you get $300. What are you going to do? We are going to have growth, growth, and jobs. Here, within the week, the Automotive News says you have to go to China and you are going to lose 900,000 industrial jobs. Go up into Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois to what I call the rust belt. The automotive parts makers are gone. By 2010, Ford expects its purchases of parts from China to rise to $10 billion. Last year, Ford's worldwide purchases of Chinese components was less than $100 million. I quote further: Suppliers who do not want to migrate to China are feeling the heat. Consider the plight of Wescast Industries. Wescast controls 70 percent of the Big Three's exhaust manifold business in North America. Ford told Wescast this year that it would transfer $50 million of its purchases from Wescast to Chinese factories, according to the industry source. Don't give me the service economy. I know about it. My light bill in Charleston, SC, is administered in Bangalore India. My insurance policy is administered in Dublin, Ireland. That is the service economy. Here is the automotive, hard machine tools industry. I quote further: For manufacturers of labor-intensive components, China is an attractive location. According to the Chinese Government data, manufacturers in Shanghai typically pay workers $1 an hour, plus 42 cents an hour in benefits. Factories in rural areas generally pay wages of 60 cents an hour. That is significantly lower than pay in Mexico which ranges from $2 to $2.50 an hour, including wages and benefits. Here is the poor Senator from South Carolina fussing about 61,000 textile jobs lost to Mexico. But we find now that the Mexican jobs they got from South Carolina are now on the way to 60 cents an hour with no benefits in the rural areas of China. It is beg thy neighbor; a race to the bottom. That is the trade policy. That is the job policy. That is the   economic policy. Don't worry about energy policy. Heavens above, why can't we catch Kenny Boy? I raised the question at that particular time when Larry Thompson became Deputy Attorney General. He is in charge of corporate corruption enforcement and violations enforcement. Before he came to Justice, he worked in a law firm in Atlanta. His firm was representing who? Kenny Boy Lay, of Enron. So I raised the question of a conflict of interest. What did he say? Oh, he didn't work on that particular client. He didn't have anything to do with it. But I run a firm, and you make money, and I make money. Come on. Here it is 2 1/2 years later--and we have gotten everybody, including Martha Stewart-for one little stock thing. This fellow, Larry Thompson, wants to know what he should be indicted for. I can draw it up for him. We had the hearing in California before the Committee on Commerce, Space, Science and Transportation. I turned to the witness, David Freeman. I said: Now, Mr. Freeman, you say all this happened with Enron, and Kenny Boy may not have known anything about it. I said: In fact, this morning on television I saw Mrs. Lay, his wife, and she said Kenny Boy didn't know anything about it. Mr. Freeman said he was the architect. He knew all about it. He designed it. Take that testimony of the knowledge of what is going on, the Enron fraud of California, the wrecked economy, and they are now calling for a recall of the Governor because of the problems Enron helped create in that state. I heard my distinguished colleague from Idaho. He said the economy went from a surplus to a deficit, and the Governor didn't do anything about it. Let us transfer that to Washington. The President started off with a surplus. He said he even had a $1 trillion rainy day fund. The budget was $53 billion in the red when he talked on February 27, 2001 to the Congress. He talked about the $2.6 billion he would set aside for Social Security. He said there was $2 billion for the budget needs in defense security, and he said he had $1 trillion left over. He was in the red then. But we have Enron accounting here in Washington. If he has gone from a $5.6 trillion surplus to a $4 trillion deficit, is anybody asking for the recall of the President? Of course not. But they think that is par for the course out there in the political intramurals in California. Come on. What is going on. It is not just GE. It is not just Ford. It is not just General Motors, or IBM--Big Blue. This was last week, July 22, from the New York Times: ``IBM Explores Shift of Some Jobs Overs eas.'' I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follow s:   ""I.B.M. Explores Shift of Some Jobs Overseas,"" New York Times, July 22, 2003, by Steven Greenhouse Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, a California IBM employee relations executive said: ..... three million service jobs were expected to shift to foreign workers ..... I.B.M. should move some of its jobs now done in the United States, including software design jobs, to India and other countries. I could read on and on. But you can see it. It is in the RECORD. You have Business Week, ``High-Tech in China.'' I don't want to include the magazine itself. But this is a quote from a Business Week article from earlier this year: Is Your Job Next? A new round of globalization is sending up-scale jobs offshore. They include chip design, engineer, basic research, financial analysis. Can America lose these jobs and still prosper? You have not just Business Week but Fortune magazine from June of this year. Here is one of the executives quoted here: ``I've been in this business for over 20 years, and it's the worst I've ever seen'', says David Hoffmann, CEO of DHR International, a Chicago-based recruiting firm. ``Nothing even comes close to th is.'' ..... relocation of the jobs to offshore sites. Machines--or low-wage foreigners--could just as easily do their work. ..... shifting jobs to cheaper locales like India and the Philippines. It's anymore. Indian radiologists now analyze CT scans and chest X-rays office park in Bangalore, not far from where Ernst & Young has 200 tax returns. E&Y's tax prep center in India is only 18 months old ..... plans to double its size. Corporate America is quickly learning that a overseas as easily as a shop floor can. not just call centers for American patients in an accountants processing U.S. but the company already has cubicle can be replicated  Irwin Kellner, who is now at Hofstra University, was at Manufacturers Hanover. We have had him before committees of the Congress year in and year out. I quote: ``White-collar workers and college graduates are in a state of shock,'' says Kellner. ``It appears these job l osses are per manen t. The y're not nec essari ly comin g back wh en the econo my does.'' Mr. President, we are in deep trouble. We are into a real trade war. We are into a thing of national survival. Let me see here. Quoting:   At the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, 96 percent of grads in 2000 had an offer when they collected their sheepskin. Only 72 percent of last year's grads were as lucky--and this year isn't shaping up any better. Even at Harvard the percentage of grads without job offers has gone from 3 percent in 2000 to 13 percent now. For schools further down the food chain, almost half the class will graduate without even one offer. Quoting further: ..... in the past two or three years companies have turned to India and the Philippines for much more sophisticated tasks: financial analysis, software design, tax preparation, even the creation of PowerPoint presentations. Quoting still further: And how cheap. Starting pay for an American accountant, says Kline, typically ranges from $40,000 to $50,000 [in the United States]. In Bangalore the accountants are paid less than half that. Another quote from the article: ..... Forrester Research predicts that 3.3 million service jobs will move to countries like India, Russia, China, and the Philippines. The firm of A.T. Kearney talked about shifting 500,000 jobs, or 8 percent of the U.S. workforce, abroad by 2008. I quote: Any function that does not require face-to-face contact is now perceived as a candidate for offshore relocation. So, Mr. President, I could go on and on. But let me just say, we are in a struggle for our economic survival. I have talked to you that free trade is a loser. We are losing all those jobs. And who is the enemy? Not just General Motors, not just IBM. I say it authoritatively because I know who wants this losing trade bill--you can start with the National Association of Manufacturers. I got into a struggle with Victor Schwartz there in the 1970s, 25 years ago. But it is not only the National Association of Manufacturers. It is the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board--yes, my dear colleagues, the United States Chamber of Commerce. The United States Chamber of Commerce is no longer interested in main street America. It was. I won U.S. Chamber of Commerce awards during my 1992 race. Bob Thompson of Greenville, SC, was the president. And I was the poster boy of the United States Chamber of Commerce. We had stopped labor law reform. We had eight cloture votes. My distinguished friend Russell Long was chairman of the Finance Committee, and we agreed the eighth vote would count. That would decide it. We would not go any further. And up until about 20 minutes before the vote, he had me beat. I heard from a friend that I might be able to persuade Ed Zorinsky of Nebraska, and I raced over to the fourth floor of the Russell Building. The rollcall had already been called. And I saw   Ed coming down the hall, and I said: Ed, I need your help. And he said: I will help you, Fritz. And we called that roll, and we won the eighth rollcall vote on cloture. This crowd gets steamed up over two or three cloture votes. So let's get to the record. I helped defeat an eighth cloture vote myself. And as a result, I was the poster boy of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Now, Tom Donohue--a nice fellow, absolutely honest--I worked with him when he represented the truckers. He knows nothing about international trade, but he is going for the money. He is for tort reform. I never heard him mention a bit about tort reform when he represented the truckers. But now he is, by gosh, the expert on free trade, free trade. When I ran in 1998, they put out pamphlets against me. They endorsed my opponent, even though I had been their poster boy. I had not changed my vote. I was the same way in trade in 1998 as I was in 1992. But you can see how this crowd is. They headed for the overseas barn. I can tell you that right now. So you have the National Association of Manufacturers, you have the Business Roundtable, you have the Conference Board. You have the United States Chamber of Commerce. I have won about six of these National Federation of Independent Business small business awards, but now they are being taken over. The U.S. Chamber and the Business Roundtable have gotten hold of them and said: Oh, we are going to get you some writeoffs, some tax breaks, too. So they are for free trade now. To increase consumer demand, you have to have consumers. In order to have consumers, you must first have producers. And in order to have producers, you have to have jobs. And we are losing them hand over fist. I have been the author of five textile trade bills that have passed the Senate. Four of those bills have gone to the President of the United States. Four have been vetoed--vetoed. President Carter vetoed one. President Reagan vetoed two. And President George Herbert Walker Bush vetoed the last one. And we came within two votes over on the House side of over turning the veto. We had a majority, but we did not have the two-thirds necessary to override. The other enemy is the Retail Federation. They order so many hundred thousand dozen shirts, or whatever it is, from China. Then, if the market is good, and they run short, they call up New Jersey quick and get another hundred thousand dozen. Now, what they get from New Jersey and what they get from China is not the same price. They get a much greater profit on the Chinese import than they do on the New Jersey shirt. I know because I got a New Jersey shirt on. Yes, sir, I believe in domestic production. Years ago, I used to represent Pontiac folks, and a bunch of other automobile dealers. Once I bought a new car, and I was so careful to buy a domestic car; no foreign car. My neighbor said: Fritz, how much did you pay for this new Pontiac? I was looking at the sticker price, when I see on th e stic ker: FO B Mont real. I ha d bough t a for eign car . I had bo ught a f oreign car and didn 't even know it. Pontiac had gone to Canada to make it because they saved $800 on the health bill on every car.   So you can understand, this has been going on for years. But we are draining the swamp. There aren't jobs left in America. And you cannot find a hometown newspaper that has endorsed protectionist trade--I don't mind saying the word. You have to protect your standard of living. We Republicans and Democrats, we say: Clean air, clean water, minimum wage, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closings, parental leave. If you put that requirement on manufacturers, you have to protect it. You can't just go over where they have none of those protections and 60 cents an hour. The newspapers make a majority of their profit on retail advertising. So the retail federation and all the big stores call the main advertisers. They go down to the editors and they give them a handout. I have compared the editorials in different parts of the country. They give them the handout, and they write the editorial. Free trade, free trade--they think they are being wise. Free trade loses jobs. We are losing the jobs right and left. But everyone is for free trade: the hometown newspaper, the Business Roundtable, the Conference Boards, the United States Chamber, the retailers, all of K Street. Have you ever had a K Street lawyer come here and ask you to vote against free trade? You can't find one. You and I are paid to protect the jobs of America. We are not paid to make a profit. But come on, you can't find a K Street lawyer who wants to protect jobs. In the Administration they think this is wonderful. They can open up the islands of Indonesia and transship through Singapore the electronic parts back into America from cheap labor. So they are all working against us. It is not just President Bush. President Clinton was for free trade, free trade. He is the one who passed NAFTA. He was the one who was going to open up and create 200,000 jobs. He impoverished the State of South Carolina, I can tell you that. We have lost 61,000 textile jobs in my little State. Where we have a BMW plant, 3 years ago we had 3.2 percent unemployment. It is over 8 percent unemployment now. Don't tell me about free trade, free trade. I have watched the outflow here. So you have the Government against us. Then if everyone is against us, who could be for us, asks the Good Book? Us. That is all I am trying to do, is wake my colleagues up to get out of this nonsense. I see the Senator from Wisconsin. I know the plants out there, too. I did work for them. I carpetbagged a few of those plants, too. I brought them to South Carolina. But we have to move to rebuild America. We have to stop whining: I am for fair trade. I am for balancing the field, leveling the field. That is all garbage. That is baloney, if I have ever heard it. We have to start and compete in the international economy. It is a trade war. It is very viable. It is very fair. It is very understandable. We have to get in there. Having rebuilt Europe and the Pacific rim, we have to, by gosh, get in there, and in order to remove a barrier, raise a barrier. Then remove them both, go by their rule   book. We are Goody Two-shoes, and we want to set the good example like we have done for 50 some years. And we have lost our shirt in manufacturing. We can go right to th e tax law. I am goin g down t he li st no w. We can go t o t he tax l aw th at says if you manufacture overseas and keep your profit, you can build a new plant. You don't have to pay taxes on that profit. Or we can turn around and go along with CHARLIE RANGEL on the House side--I have the bill in on the Senate side--and say if you manufacture and keep your jobs in America, you get a tax credit. If you go overseas, you lose. You get a tax increase. That is what we ought to do. Make it so rather than trying to revive Europe and the Pacific rim, we have to revive the United States. Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to. Mrs. BOXER. It is very interesting that you said this because when we heard from Mr. Wolfowitz in front of the Foreign Relations Committee where we had a hearing on the rebuilding of Iraq, t he fir st th ing he s aid ma tched what M r. Brem er sai d, who is in charge o f the r ebuil ding. He said: Those people over there need jobs. They need to get the economy going. They need jobs. And I say to my friend, isn't there something ironic about that, that there is a total understanding of what the folks in Iraq need, when I could say in my State and yours and all through America, this should be the priority of the President in this country. Mr. HOLLINGS. Cer tai nly, it oug ht to be. Tha t is ou r du ty here i n the C ong res s. A rti cle I, section 8 of the Constitution says not the President but the Congress of the United States shall regulate foreign commerce. But what have we done? We have got in a fix through the Finance Committee and Ways and Means. They got fast track. And I would like to vote for Chile because Chile has a free economy, a market-based economy, a revered judiciary, labor rights, environmental laws, and a balanced budget. But I can't vote with that immigration thing included. Under fast track, I can't amend. I can't debate. I can't discuss. I can't do anything. Let me bring up a red herring that will excite everybody. I introduced it in January. I said: Good gosh, we are going to war, and we don't have a way to pay for it. We paid for the Revolutionary War with a property tax. That is the first property tax that passed in this country. We got to the Civil War, and Abraham Lincoln put on an estate tax and a dividend tax. And we were running around here talking about taking off the estate and dividend tax. I said, come on, we paid for World War II. We paid for Korea. We paid for Vietnam. We paid for the gulf war. The Saudis did a good bit of that, as we all know. I said, I am going to put Why? Why do I want to Washington, DC, I have Paris, France, I add on a in a value-added tax. Every industrialized country has a value-added tax. do that? It is twofold: One, if I take and manufacture this desk in to pay all the income, sales, corporate taxes. And when I ship it over to 17 percent VAT.   If I manufactured that same desk in Paris, France, when it leaves the port of La Havre to come to Washington, we rebate the 17 percent. And so it is a 17 percent advantage to manufacture in Paris rather than in Washington. I want to reconcile that differential immediately with a valueadded tax. I want to pay for the war. That is the trouble this country is in. Bill Clinton brought the budget deficit down. He put in an increase in tax. I voted to increase Social Security. I voted to increase the gasoline tax. I voted to increase the top payer income tax. We voted also to cut spending, and we had an 8-year economic boom. And now we just had three quarters of recession in 2001, a bad economy all through 2002, and they kept blaming it on the war. The war in Iraq only costs $4 billion a month. That is $48 billion year, and when the President talked on February 27, he said: I have $1 trillion for unforeseen needs. The tax cuts have wrecked the economy. Everybody knows it. They are running around--jobs and growth, jobs and growth--like a bunch of children trying to sell that nonsense. So we ought to pay for the war, reconcile this trade differential and manufacturing differential. We ought to, by gosh, enforce our dumping laws. The competition is not for money or profit. The competition is for market share. When the Japanese sell below cost in the United States and make it up in the domestic market in Tokyo, we have to enforce dumping laws. The special Trade Representative runs out to do that and says we are going to do away with the dumping laws. That is loss leaders. I had an antitrust case and carried it to the Supreme Court on a loss leader. I know the law of loss leaders. That is what you have in international competition. There are a bunch of loss leaders and they keep taking over, even this year, a greater share of the American automobile market. So we have to enforce our dumping laws. We have to eliminate the Trade Commission. That is another gimmick put in by the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee--when you have a dumping violation, you file it before the International Trade Administration. They investigate and make a finding. After they make a finding, they have a sweetheart deal. They kick it over to the International Trade Commission, and they never find injury. I can tell you they have two or three exceptions since I have been talking about it, but we can save $43 million and let the finding entity, the International Trade Administration, that gives the penalty on what is to be done. We can save money there. We need more Customs agents, and we need a department of trade. We have the Department of Manufacturing in the Commerce Committee. We can gear up for the trade war. Don't worry about the Afghan war. I think we may have created more terrorists than we have gotten rid of. The jury is out in Iraq, as to whether or not we can work out the peace. I can tell we don't have any friends in downtown Baghdad. It is a shooting gallery. They are killing our soldiers every day. What we have to do is get into this trade war and compete. Now, finally, the administration says they are going to get up consumer confidence. They have   passed three voodoo tax cuts. Of course, Ronald Reagan passed voodoo 1, and George Herbert Walker Bush is the one who called it voodoo. How are you going to cut your revenues and increase your revenues? You never do that. You will never find a government doing that. But come to Washington, and they know everything up here. So they are going to increase the consumer confidence with tax cuts they had in 2001, 2002, and already this year. With those three tax cuts of over $3.1 trillion, here is the news that came out yesterday: the consumer confidence index dropped 7 points to 7.6 in July, a sharp and unexpected drop. We have a $698 billion budget deficit projected for this year. It is already $503 billion. (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.) Mr. President, you can see the effects. You can see Wall Street is frozen. They are not going to invest when the interest rates are on the increase.

We are sitting by talking about a little Energy bill or a judgeship. The country is going to hell in an economic hand basket and we are the ones responsible under the Constitution and we are not doing anything about it. I yield the floor."

The gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) each will control 1 hour.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ).     GENERAL LEAVE   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today is an exciting day for me personally, and it is a great day for the hundreds of thousands of working seniors across this country. It is the culmination of my personal 29-year effort to repeal the earnings penalty.   I launched this effort as one of the first bills that I introduced after being sworn in in 1971. The reason then to repeal the earnings penalty is the same as it is today: the earnings penalty is simply wrong. I also thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ); the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security; and the Speaker for their tireless efforts on this bill.   The Social Security earnings penalty, like the marriage tax penalty, like the death tax, like the capital gains tax, like the tax on savings, like the alternative minimum tax and so many other taxes, is simply unfair and wrong. It is unfair; it is backwards. The earnings penalty actually cuts Social Security benefits for many working seniors over the age of 65, and it discourages them from working. It increases their effective tax rate to the highest percentage of a lifetime for many of them, and that is wrong.   Now, why in the world would we want to discourage any American, whether they are 17 or 67, from working?   Today this Congress will once again do the right thing and repeal the earnings penalty for those hard-working and deserving Americans. I am proud to be a part of a Congress that fixes what is wrong and does what is right.   It was right to balance the budget and to pay down the debt, and we did that. It was right to strengthen Medicare, and we did that. It was right to cut taxes for families and to promote higher education and expand health care, and we did that. It was right to fix the broken welfare system so that Americans can discover the freedom of work, independence and the power of responsibility, and we did that. It was right to reform the IRS, and we did that. It was right to expand educational opportunities for school children and give more flexibility to parents, teachers and local school boards, and we did that. It was right to stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund and protect every dime of Social Security from being spent on other programs, and we did that.   Now it is right to repeal the earnings penalty for working seniors. They deserve to be treated fairly. After all these years, it is heartening that this effort is finally bipartisan and the President will sign this bill. Clearly it is the right thing to do.   The Social Security earnings penalty punishes seniors who choose to keep working. More seniors are choosing to work past their retirement for many reasons: for their own financial needs, because Social Security benefits for most are not adequate by themselves to support retirement; to help their families or their grandchildren through school; and for their own personal fulfillment. The point is, Americans are living longer now and older Americans can work, they want to work, and they should not be punished by an outdated law if they choose to work.   In addition, repealing the earnings penalty now will unleash the productivity of one of the most experienced and talented workforces in this country at a time when our growing economy needs it. This is clearly a win-win for everyone, which is why the bill now enjoys widespread bipartisan support.   In summary, repealing the earnings penalty is based on the fundamental principles of fairness and freedom. Seniors should be free to work without penalty and treated fairly by a program they paid into all of their lives. Working seniors across this country have waited long enough; and they deserve the action now, and they will get it now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     [Page: H584]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to congratulate the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ), certainly the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and members of the committee, and also the two prime sponsors of this bill, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson ). They have obviously done a great job in getting cosponsors of this bill and explaining it to Members of this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to reiterate some of the words of the chairman of the committee. The earnings test is obviously something that has been misunderstood over the years. It is basically a penalty on those senior citizens that have earned their Social Security benefit but want to stay in the workforce beyond the age of 65.   The fact that we have had this earnings test actually has deterred over 800,000 Americans a year from the workforce. In fact, we have had some studies done by a University of California San Diego professor that has said that this will actually, by eliminating the earnings test, increase the labor pool in America by 5 percent.   In addition, the Social Security Administration has estimated that the administration of the earnings test plus the delayed earnings credit essentially costs $100 to $150 million a year; and because of the earnings credit, we have seen errors in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 per year just in administering this program. As a result of that, it is obvious we should repeal it at this particular time.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope also as we talk about repealing this earnings test, which will be done, we not be unmindful of what the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Stenholm ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Kolbe ) said in terms of some of the long-term issues of Social Security that I am sure all of us in this institution want to deal with.   The gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) yesterday when we marked up this bill indicated he will be holding in the month of March, this month, some additional hearings dealing with poverty among women, the blind and the disabled, and I want to thank the gentleman for holding those hearings as well, because I think that will further the procession of making sure that we create incentives for work under the Social Security system for those that need to work and receive benefits at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an `aye' vote on this particular bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), the highly respected chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I obviously strongly support H.R. 5, legislation that would repeal the earnings penalty for hard-working seniors age 65 and over. Many seniors are shocked to learn that if they work past the age of 65 they may lose some or even all of their Social Security benefits. This is due to something called the Social Security `earnings limit' or `earnings penalty.' This rule has been in place since Social Security started in the 1930's, but that does not make it right.   Because of this rule, many older people left the workforce, making their jobs available for younger workers. That policy may have made sense during the Great Depression when those jobs were needed. However, that clearly does not apply today.   Today's economy needs the experience and ability of seniors; yet the earnings penalty has lived on. Seniors affected by this penalty lose an average of $8,000 in benefits per year. Nationwide, about 800,000 lost benefits just last year, and thousands more avoided losing benefits by cutting back on how much they worked in order to avoid this unfair penalty.   Some might recall that in 1996 we eased the earnings limit for seniors who reached the full retirement age. As a result, seniors aged 65 through 69 have been able to earn a bit more each year since then without experiencing the cut in their benefits. While that was a positive step, many of us have long felt that it was wrong to punish hard-working seniors, period, many of whom just want to work, and many of whom have to work.   Mr. Speaker, what message does the earnings penalty send? That the contributions of seniors are no longer needed? That seniors should head for the sidelines of the economy due to age alone? That seniors do not deserve the benefits that they paid for simply because they continue working? I do not think anybody in this chamber or in this Congress feels that way. That is why so many of us have expressed support for H.R. 5, this bipartisan bill before us today, that will eliminate this penalty for good.   A broad spectrum of business and senior groups, including the AARP, support this bill. They know it is good for seniors, it is good for business, and it is good for this country and its economy.   I congratulate the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson ), the original sponsors of the bill. I want to congratulate the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ) for his years of tireless work in relaxing and now repealing this earnings penalty. The gentleman has been a personal testament to what hard-working seniors can do. The gentleman especially should be gratified that all of his years of hard work to repeal this unfair limit are paying off.   Mr. Speaker, eliminating the earnings penalty is the right thing for seniors who have spent a lifetime working for their Social Security benefits. They should get all the benefits they earn and that they have paid for. Today we are taking one major step closer to seeing that occur. I encourage the Senate to approve this legislation quickly so it can be signed into law as promised by the President.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Stark ).   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time and join in the accolades to those who have brought this bill to the floor today, which addresses a problem probably for 5 percent of the wealthiest beneficiaries under Social Security. It is a vestigial prohibition on getting retirement income. No other retirement plan denies that.   I was intrigued this morning as we had all of this bipartisan self-congratulation. The fact is that while we do this, there are partisan rumblings in attacking members of the Democratic Party for sometime in the past perhaps having voted against this procedure in another bill. So I would just as soon unmask for a while, in the most partisan way I can, the Republican charade, because while we are doing this, we are still denying under the Republican leadership the chance for the Patients' Bill of Rights bill to go forward. It is a bill that was passed in a bipartisan way; yet it is being stalled by the Republicans.   Last year in October in the Committee on Ways and Means, in a bipartisan attempt to pass the Balanced Budget Act, we offered an amendment that would have given a discount on pharmaceutical drugs to every senior, a substantial discount, at no cost to the Federal Government, and every Republican voted to deny the seniors this opportunity to get a discount on their pharmaceutical drugs. So as we talk later today, I hope that the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) will explain to me why that is a good bipartisan thing for the seniors in Florida to be denied a discount, and I hope the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Hayworth ) will come down and explain to us why he voted to deny seniors in Arizona a discount on their pharmaceutical drugs.     [Page: H585]     [TIME: 1100]   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ), a respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding time to me. I appreciate what he has been doing on this bill. I know he has been working on it for many, many years. We truly appreciate it coming up today.   Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago I introduced H.R. 5, the Freedom to Work Act. Yesterday, every member of the Committee on Ways and Means voted to send the bill to the floor to repeal the social security earnings penalty.   Under current law, our seniors age 65 to 69 can earn only $17,000 before they lose $1 in social security benefits for every $3 they earn. This limit is unfair, outdated, and bad for the economy. This obsolete social security earnings penalty must be eliminated.   As we all know, our seniors have earned social security benefits through a lifetime of contributions. They have worked for them, and they are entitled to their full benefits. It is their money, it is not Washington's money. It should not be taken away from them just because they choose to work after they reach normal retirement age.   The earnings penalty adversely affects 800,000 seniors who reach the normal retirement age. It discriminates against our senior citizens who must work in order to supplement their benefits. That is just not right. The earnings penalty is a Depression-era law whose time has long since come and gone. Today, with unemployment at record lows, seniors are needed in the work force, so the last thing we ought to do is discourage them from working.   Senior citizens who work not only lose a large percentage of their social security benefits today due to the earnings penalty, but they pay social security taxes, Medicare taxes, Federal taxes, and probably State income taxes, as well. Combined with the earnings penalty and these other taxes, our seniors may face a marginal tax rate as high as 80 percent.   The earnings penalty is complicated and difficult to understand. In addition, the earnings penalty is complex and costly to the Federal government to administer. For example, the earnings penalty is responsible for more than half of the social security overpayments.   The Social Security Administration estimates that administering the earnings penalty takes 1,200 people and costs $150 million a year. Repeal of the earnings penalty would allow our senior citizens to work more, the American economy would benefit from their experience and skills, and it does not cost anything.   According to the Social Security Administration actuaries, a repeal of the earnings penalty will not affect the social security trust fund. Two weeks ago, the President finally agreed to sign the bill. I am pleased that he has decided to help us fix this unfair penalty.   Mr. Speaker, I fought for freedom in two wars, Korea and Vietnam. I believe that freedom entitles our seniors the ability to work without penalty. America's seniors want, need, and deserve a repeal of this penalty.   Mr. MINETA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Cardin ).   Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, as has been pointed out, last year almost 800,000 seniors had their social security benefits reduced because of this earnings test. Next year, over 600,000 seniors will be forced to defer their benefits because they had earnings over $17,000.   Today we are passing a commonsense change that allows seniors to be able to earn, be able to continue to work, and be able to collect their social security checks. As the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) pointed out, it will have no effect on the long-term solvency of social security.   For the first time, we allow seniors to continue to earn a paycheck without taking it out of their social security check. Seniors who want to continue working should be able to stay in the labor force without losing their hard-earned social security benefits. At a time with a tight labor market and historically low personal savings, it does not make sense to discourage our most experienced workers from staying productive. Yet, the earnings penalty amounts to a 33 percent marginal tax rate on work.   This change will particularly help women workers, who have historically had lower earnings and an uneven work history. Work for women becomes even more important, and they should not be penalized by the social security system.   Mr. Speaker, let me point out, as my friend, the gentleman from Texas, pointed out during an earlier discussion, yes, many of us would like to see comprehensive reform of our social security system. We should be doing that. But we should not stop making changes that are commonsense, that we can get done, such as removing the earnings test.   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the same logic should apply to Medicare. If we are unable to bring forward comprehensive Medicare reform, let us at least agree on prescription drugs. We know in a bipartisan way that we need to do that.   The example that we have used on this earnings test, a bipartisan agreement between the Democrats and the Republicans to move this bill, let us do the same on other issues that are important to all of our constituents.   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Hayworth ), another respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. HAYWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding time to me, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, who has labored so hard for this commonsense reform so greatly needed for so long.   History reminds us that Arizona's favorite son, Barry Goldwater, in the other Chamber, brought this idea forward long ago. I am so glad, in the spirit of bipartisanship now, that others in previous Congresses so reluctant to address this commonsense reform would join with us today for this landmark legislation.   Almost 20,000 seniors in Arizona, 1.1 million seniors nationwide, are being penalized because they choose to work, are being penalized because they bring to the workplace maturity and experience and energy.   Mr. Speaker, we need those experienced workers in our work force. One thing I have learned in representing the Sixth Congressional District of Arizona, with so many seniors, is that these folks have so much to contribute, so much to give, yes, as volunteers in retirement age, but also active in the work force. That is what they bring and that is what we celebrate today.   So again, we welcome the converts to this, and we are at long last addressing this issue. This is a great day for America's seniors, for all Americans, because today we throw off the yoke of unfairness: an important first step which we must follow in many other ways, but it begins here, it begins now, and we welcome the cooperation.   Mr. MINETA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett ).   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, in 1996, I voted to increase the Social Security earnings limit to $30,000, effectively the year after next. In 1998, I voted to increase it even further, up to $39,000. So I am, of course, supportive when the Republican leadership finally gives us an opportunity to take the cap off entirely. This bill may help as many as 5 percent of our most successful seniors.   But amid all the self-congratulatory back-slapping that we see here today, let us be sure to understand what this bill is and what it is not. It represents well-justified relief for the top 5 percent. It represents top-down reform, but it does nothing for the 95 percent of the remaining Americans who rely on social security. It does nothing for those seniors whose health does not permit them to work, and who would benefit more from getting access to prescription drugs and an end to the discrimination they face with huge prices they are charged by the pharmaceutical companies.   This legislation is very significant to older Americans who have the capacity to keep earning more than $30,000 a year, but in terms of overall reform of the Social Security system, to preserve it for future generations, it is a very modest change.   Of all the changes that we can make in this Congress, interestingly enough, this is one of the few that is politically painless. It represents essentially an eat-dessert-first approach to reform. Congress should be grappling with the tough choices that we face on how to extend the solvency of Social Security for all Americans and for future generations of Americans, not just the politically easy step that primarily puts more benefits in the pockets of the most successful seniors, coincidentally, during an election year.   I would say this morning, better a reform for 5 percent than no reform at all. But for most Americans who are counting on Social Security, this change makes no real difference in their lives. It is long past time that this Congress got about doing something for them.     [Page: H586]   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Foley ), another respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I thank the chairman for his hard work on this bill. Since 1986 the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ), the chairman of our committee, has been working on this product, joined with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hastert ), now, and with the leadership of the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ), we see victory today for senior citizens.   But even in light of victory, we have to have a little bit of a political zinger put on the floor by the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett ). He has to drill a little needle there into this debate, rather than celebrate the rewards of senior citizens across America.   At 65, under this policy that was maintained by 40 years of Democratic leadership, we were telling seniors, get out of the way, you are too old and you are too tired. Modern-day America recognizes, and particularly our party recognizes, that seniors 65 are in the prime of their lives.   My father at 77 years of age retired as a principal of a high school in Lake Worth, Florida. He contributed to the children of Palm Beach County schools, and he did it because, first and foremost, he loved children, and secondly, he had a lot to give to our community.   But no, for many, many years they blocked the attempt to reform this crazy notion of retirement at 65, or penalizing, should one work.   Mr. Speaker, let us face reality. Just like social security predicts that more retirees than active workers will exist in 10 or 20 years, so will be the notion of less workers available for active duty. This bill provides relief for the baby boomers who will retire to stay engaged and stay working.   So today, rather than taking political shots across the aisle, let us join hands in this bipartisan spirit. But I must insist on commending the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ), because he has been working on this when he was in the minority, and finally now has had comity from the other side of the aisle to bring this measure to the floor; the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hastert ) in the same period, and again, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) from my district.   The gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and I have probably the 6th and 7th oldest Medicare recipient districts in the Nation. So today I join my good friend, the gentleman from south Florida, in saluting our retirees who worked so hard to pay to run the government of the United States of America.   Mr. MINETA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson ), the original sponsor of this legislation.   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today, along with my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ), bringing this bill forward.   This is something that I have been for for a long time. I used to do tax returns for a living, and saw firsthand the impact this had on people. This is something that probably made sense back in the thirties, but its time has past. It is time for us to get rid of this penalty, which causes these people to pay some of the highest marginal tax rates in this country.   My district is a very rural district. We are having a lot of trouble out in the farm part of the district. In the cities, St. Cloud is a big city, and Moorhead, which is a middle-sized city, or Aurora, which is a small city, the problems we are having is getting enough workers to fill the jobs that we have out there.   In this pool of workers that are being penalized, we have a lot of people that have talent that want to work, and this is going to free up a lot of folks to do what they want to do. It makes sense.   One other thing I want to focus on. One of the things this will solve is, part of the problem our farmers are having is with their being taxed on the rent that they are charging for their farmland. The IRS, because apparently one word was left out of a statute, are forcing farmers to pay self-employment tax on their rent. These are the only businesspeople in America that are doing this. If you are in the real estate business, if you are a CPA, if you rent a building or land to your kids or to anybody else, you do not pay self-employment tax, but farmers do.   If they pay this self-employment tax, they can also be subject to the self-employment tax penalty that we are getting rid of here today, so this is going to solve part of the problem.   We appreciate the chairman's leadership on this issue, and we hope the gentleman would look at the other part of the problem, because it really is crazy, what we are doing to farmers. They have tremendous pressure on them now. In my district, none of them are making any money.     [TIME: 1115]   The last thing they need is to have another tax put on them. So we would appreciate a look at that.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?   Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. SHAW. The gentleman has brought up a very sensitive point.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.  LaHood ). The time of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson ) has expired.   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Houghton ), another respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. HOUGHTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield briefly to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ).   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson ) brought up a point that we are waiting for the Commissioner of Social Security to reply to, because he has raised a very good point and something that our committee intends to address. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Houghton ) for yielding to me.   Mr. HOUGHTON. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) for yielding me this time. It is sort of too bad that certain people on the other side take a partisan view of this thing. It is not partisan; it is bipartisan. It makes sense. The timing is right. There is overwhelming support for this.   When I started to work in the early 1950s, 47 percent of the people over 65 were working. Today, only 17 percent. That is not very good.   I always think as the speed of light and communication and data processing is sort of inevitable, so is the fact that people are living longer.   I have a mother who is 99 years old, born in 1900. When she was born, the actual actuarial age of women was about 47. That was the life span. Today, it is in the 70s. Tremendous difference.   We need able people. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway has a lady over 90 years old working in his company. When companies get somebody good, they want to hold on to them. And people who work longer, they live longer, they feel healthy and want to make a contribution. So anything standing in the way, which is this double taxation of their Social Security benefits, is wrong and is not fair and it will be scrapped, and should be scrapped, if H.R. 5 goes through.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say one other thing. There was a lady called Marijo Gorney, and she has worked around here for 35 years. She is now retired. Mr. Speaker, this was her baby. This was her concept. She pushed it. She is now retired; and I hope she is watching this, because a lot of the success of this program is due to her.     [Page: H587]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Neal ) a member of the committee.   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer my voice in support of repeal of the earnings test, and I am certainly pleased that the Committee on Ways and Means acted so quickly, once President Clinton urged us to do so on February 14. I only wish that at the committee level we could be as accommodating on some other issues.   The retirement test is clearly a provision which has outlived its usefulness. With senior citizens living longer and longer, we should encourage those who want to continue to work, rather than discourage that effort. I do wish that we had the ability in committee to make some additional changes, however, such as offering the government pension offset that was sponsored by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Jefferson ).   Mr. Speaker, this unfair provision affects the spousal benefits of State and local workers and was enacted in response to a Supreme Court case that dealt with an entirely different problem. It is now time for that provision to be repealed as well, or at least significantly modified.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bipartisan bill. I hope it reaches the President's desk soon, and I hope it will serve as an example that reaching an agreement when we can is far better for the American people than producing what is oftentimes so much unnecessary conflict in this institution. I am pleased to lend my name in support of this initiative. It is long overdue, but the point is that we are acting on it today. I think that there is an opportunity here for a lot of people to take some satisfaction from this initiative.   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Goss ).   (Mr. GOSS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. GOSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ), my friend and the distinguished chairman, for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise, obviously, in strong support of H.R. 5. As just one of many on this side of the aisle who has worked hard to eliminate the archaic and punitive Social Security earnings test since coming to Congress 12 years ago, I am delighted that today we are finally going to right this wrong.   I represent many seniors in southwest Florida who have eagerly awaited this moment and I know are going to be very happy. Last year, over 800,000 seniors across America were penalized simply because they chose or needed, needed, to remain productive members of our workforce. In an ever-expanding economy where employers increasingly lack capable and experienced employees, the Federal Government contrarily sends a message that our seniors need not apply.   I know it is true, because I hear it firsthand from working seniors in southwest Florida who choose to stay active and supplement their retirement, perhaps as a cashier at the local grocery store or perhaps as a substitute teacher at the middle school.   Proud Americans who survived the Depression and   defeated Hitler's Germany are punished for displaying the same self-reliance, perseverance, and individual responsibility that defines them as our greatest generation and, frankly, has made our Nation as great as it is today. It is a national embarrassment that we will end today.   Today, finally, and I say finally, the White House and congressional Democrats will apparently join with us in ending the unfair earnings tax. But it was not always so. Just 2 years ago, only 19 Democrats voted to end the earnings limit. But in the best spirit of our representative democracy, we have made our case and we have persuaded them, or at least most of them, to join us. This has been a long and trying fight. And besides the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), my Florida colleague, and the gentleman from Texas ( Sam Johnson ), courageous souls like Jay Rhodes no longer here,  Jim Bunning  in the other body, who should be here to celebrate with us today I hope are taking joy in this.   Above all, we should cheer our Speaker, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hastert ) who led the fight for incremental reform before it was fashionable and who appropriately will preside over this Congress today as we end this tax on working seniors once and for all. I urge a `yes' vote.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price ).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Seniors Freedom to Work Act. More than 800,000 senior citizens aged 65 to 69 in our country lose part or all of their Social Security benefits each year because of this so-called earnings test.   Currently, the Social Security earnings penalty takes $1 in Social Security benefits from Americans 65 through 69 for every $3 they earn above the $17,000 per year limit. When Americans turn 65, they ought to be able to count on the Social Security benefits they have earned, and this bill would repeal the earnings test once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. But unfortunately, there has been a little partisan byplay here today; not from our side of the aisle, but from our friends on the Republican side. They are accusing us of reversing ourselves on this issue. They are referring to what in 1998 we aptly termed the Raid Social Security for an Election Eve Tax Cut Act. I would like to just read what I said at the time we debated that bill:   `The problem is not with the specific tax cuts, but with using the Social Security Trust Fund surplus to pay for them. These tax cuts are also contained in the Democratic substitute', in fact, it included exactly identical earnings test provisions, `but they are paid for in that substitute and they maintain the trust in the trust fund.'   So what we have before us right now, Mr. Speaker, is clean legislation that addresses the earnings test issue, unencumbered by controversial or extraneous provisions. Today, we have an opportunity for a bipartisan bill, a bipartisan result, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. ARCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Armey ), Majority Leader of the House of Representatives.   Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) for yielding me this time. I just wanted to take a moment to add my word of appreciation for everybody's good work on this. There can be nothing I can imagine that can be more unfair to our working senior Americans than to be told that under the law of this land that they are required to pay into the Social Security program all their working years, and then at that time in their life when they are entitled to withdraw the benefits that they paid for, that the government of the United States is going to take those benefits away if they have the audacity to continue work.   Many of us have seen the injustice of this, and so many of us have worked on it over the years and had so many years of frustration.   Mr. Speaker, I always like to remind people that this is the very first bill that the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) introduced in Congress in 1972. I studied it as an undergraduate. I understood at the time how important it was. I have watched the gentleman from Texas ( Sam Johnson ), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Weller ), and the Speaker himself and others, and it is just such a heart-warming thing for me today to see us passing this legislation with such bipartisan support.   The President committed to sign it, and we will finally have a real act of justice and fairness for today's working seniors. I just wanted to share in that moment with all of our body.     [Page: H588]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Spratt ) the ranking member on the Committee on the Budget.   (Mr. SPRATT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of this bill, the retirement earnings test is an old vestige of the 1930s, created when Social Security was born as a way of telling who was truly retired and, therefore, qualified for benefits. It was looked upon as good policy then because it spurred older workers to stop working and take their Social Security benefits and, therefore, freed up jobs for younger workers in what was then, the 1930s, a period of high unemployment.   Today, we do not have a labor surplus in most parts of the country; we have a labor shortage. For example, I had an owner of a trucking company call me a few months ago and tell me in desperation that this offset policy in Social Security was causing him to lose drivers. They would not work upon reaching the age of 65, and he could not replace them. He saw no reason for this policy, and I can tell from talking to other workers in my district neither do they.   We can explain all the reasons behind it, going back to 1935, but most people see this as a stiff, unfair, tax on hard-working people. I think it is time for us to repeal these offsets all together for those people who have reached retirement age. The question arises: Why did we not do this in 1998? There has been some accusation here that some of us who voted for that particular tax bill then, which was an $8.1 billion tax bill in 1998, voted against the elimination of the threshold. That bill would not have eliminated the threshold. It would have raised the threshold to $39,750 by 2008.   But in 1996, almost all of us came out here and voted for H.R. 3136, the Senior Citizens' Right to Work Act of 1996. This bill raised the limit in annual steps from $12,500 to $30,000 by 2002, and indexed the threshold after 2002 to rise with the rate of inflation. Had we simply followed the course of that law, by 2008, the threshold would have been about $38,000, just a little bit less than the bill in 1998 provided.   So this argument is really not a fair argument. I am glad to see us bring something to the floor that is bipartisan. Let us keep it bipartisan. I do not think I need to encourage anybody to vote for this. The vote is going to be overwhelming. And any time we get this kind of bipartisan consensus on an issue of this substance, it is a sign of an idea whose time has come.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is right that we repeal today, right now, as soon as possible, this old and outdated vestige of the Social Security system and say this is something on which we all agree.   Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Weller ), one of our great committee members.   (Mr. WELLER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, today's debate is all about fairness. This Congress has accomplished so much over the last 5 years, and I am proud that just in the past year we have accomplished our goal of stopping the raid on Social Security for the first time in 30 years and we balanced the budget without touching one dime of Social Security, paid down $350 billion of the national debt, and 3 short weeks ago this House passed with 268 votes, 48 Democrats joining with every House Republican, legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes just because they are married.   Like the marriage tax penalty, the earnings limit on our seniors is an issue of fairness. And I want to commend the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hastert ), the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ), the gentleman from Florida (Chairman  Shaw ), and the gentleman from Texas ( Sam Johnson ) who have been tireless leaders and fighters for this effort to bring fairness to seniors.   Mr. Speaker, let us not forget that this effort to repeal the earnings test on seniors was part of the Contract with America. It is unfinished business. For far too long, seniors who work after age 65 have been punished. Since the 1930s, seniors who live longer, want to be active longer and work longer, have been punished. 800,000 seniors in America, 53,000 seniors in my home State in Illinois, are punished just because they want to work when they are age 65 or older.   I think of my own parents, farmers in their early 70s today who want to work and be active longer. Like millions, they suffer.   Mr. Speaker, the earnings limit on seniors is wrong. Let us repeal it. I appreciate the fact the President now says he will sign it into law. That makes it a bipartisan effort. I commend the chairman and commend the Speaker and commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) my friend, for their leadership. Let us get the job done. I ask for an `aye' vote.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman ).   Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, success has many fathers; failure is an orphan. This bill is an outstanding bill and we are all fighting over paternity.   It is a bill that will help our economy by bringing experienced workers into a labor shortage work environment. It is a bill that will help 800,000 seniors and it is a bill that will actually help Social Security by bringing additional Social Security revenue and income tax revenue into the Federal Government as additional seniors enter the workforce.     [TIME: 1130]   As to the fight over paternity, it is a Democratic President who stood here in his State of the Union message and urged us to pass this bill and the Democratic alternative bill in 1998 which provided an increase in this limit which we are now going to repeal, and that alternative bill would have been signed into law. We voted for a bill that would have dealt with this issue in 1998 and would have become law.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Sweeney ).   Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise very briefly to congratulate the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ). I rise in strong support to repeal the earnings limitation for Social Security recipients. I am particularly pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. And I want to congratulate the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Johnson ).   We have had a lot of debate and discussion over whose idea this was, but I think the record is very clear and will very clearly show that we, the majority in Congress, over the last 5 to 6 years have really begun to move forward in a meaningful way to bring steps towards comprehensive reform of Social Security. I am proud to join that effort. This is good for senior citizens, and it is good for America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support us in this endeavor.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Levin ), a member of the committee.   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, bipartisan legislation, to repeal the Social Security retirement earnings test. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation which has the backing of so many of us on the Committee on Ways and Means.   This legislation is supported by the Clinton administration. Indeed, the President called for repeal of the test more than a year ago.   As the Subcommittee on Social Security learned during the hearing on this bill on February 15, the retirement earnings test is both confusing to beneficiaries and difficult to administer. It discourages older people from remaining in the workforce and contributing to our country's economic growth. It is past time to eliminate this disincentive to work.   The bill repeals the test for workers who attained the normal retirement age. Its repeal will allow literally hundreds of thousands of Social Security recipients to work without a reduction in their benefits. This is an idea whose time has come.   It is important to note that the repeal does not adversely affect the long-term financial health of Social Security.   This bill shows that members of the committee can work in a bipartisan way. I hope this effort remains such.   Let me stress that passage of H.R. 5 today is not in any way a substitute for comprehensive Social Security reform. Congress must redouble its efforts to pass legislation to extend solvency of the fund.   Again, the President has proposed legislation that would defeat the interest savings earned by paying down the publicly held debt to make Social Security stronger. This would extend the solvency of the program to 2050.   There is an old proverb that says that a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step. We are taking a good first step with the passage of H.R. 5 today. It should not, Mr. Speaker, be our last.     [Page: H589]   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Herger ), an esteemed member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, what could be more fair than allowing seniors to continue working without losing Social Security benefits?   Today we are voting on legislation to end the outdated Social Security earnings limit. Under this legislation, more than 800,000 seniors nationwide will have the opportunity to work without seeing their Social Security benefits reduced.   Consider a senior in my district in northern California who is between the ages of 65 and 70 and who earns $20,000 a year to supplement their Social Security benefits. Under current law, this senior will lose $1,000 in Social Security benefits due to the earnings limit.   At a time when our U.S. workforce needs the skills seniors have to offer, this disincentive to work makes absolutely no sense. Our seniors deserve the freedom to work without being penalized for it.   This legislation before us today is based on the principles of fairness and freedom. Seniors should be treated fairly after paying into Social Security all their lives. They should have the freedom to work without worrying about losing their benefits.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that this legislation is fiscally responsible. It does not affect the long-term solvency of the Social Security trust fund.   I commend the President for supporting our position to end the outdated earnings limit. Mr. Speaker, let us give all our seniors the freedom and the fairness they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green ).   (Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank not only the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) but also the members of the Committee on Ways and Means for allowing me to speak.   I rise in support of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, a legislation that I am proud to be a co-sponsor of and will vote for today.   It seems hard to believe that our tax law actually punishes people for working. Yet under the current law, 48,000-plus Texans lose all or part of their Social Security payments each month simply because they want to work. Now if one can work after one is 70 years old, one is not penalized.   Seniors who have worked hard their whole lives and paid into the Social Security system for decades should get their Social Security benefits regardless of whether they continue to work. This important legislation puts an end to the inequitable treatment of seniors.   My only concern, Mr. Speaker, is that, hopefully, this is not a step toward increasing the retirement age, Congress already did that once, instead of using 65. So hopefully this will not happen.   This is a clean bill. It is not loaded down with other provisions. So it does not bust the Federal budget caps that we have talked about.   Hopefully, this Congress can address other senior citizens issues, providing prescription medication for seniors, because allowing them to work still may not pay for it.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  English ), a respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. ENGLISH. Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to congratulate the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security, for his extraordinary leadership, not only on this issue, but in moving forward to make Social Security more solvent.   Mr. Speaker, today Congress says to seniors, you may choose to work, choose to remain part of the productive economy, and choose to share your talents. Right now the Social Security system places a higher tax penalty on working seniors than on billionaires. We have been sending seniors the message that when they hit retirement age that we do not want them anymore. We need to change that.   The earnings limit was created 60 years ago, and it is a relic of Depression-era economics that says seniors should make room for younger workers. We now know that seniors add more to the workforce and more to the economy than they can ever take away. They add their years of experience, their expertise, their talents.   This legislation repeals the earnings limit that unfairly punishes seniors who earn more than $17,000 a year. This arbitrary limit serves as a barrier to many low- and middle-class seniors who take on a job because they need to work in order to improve their quality of life or even just to make ends meet. They must not lose Social Security benefits that they earn simply because they choose to work.   The Social Security Administration reports that more than 800,000 working seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 lose part or all of their Social Security benefits due to this outdated limitation. That is an outrage.   In Pennsylvania, we are sixth in the number of seniors adversely affected by the earnings limit; 48,000, over 48,000 Pennsylvania seniors are penalized for working.   I urge my colleagues to join the AARP, join the Subcommittee on Social Security, and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and vote in favor of this legislation. It is important that Congress protect the dignity of retirement and unshackle the creative energies of America's seniors.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell ).   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ) for the leadership in working to bring to the floor this very important piece of legislation.   We are focusing on reforming our existing Social Security program, correcting an unfairness that impacted 800,000 seniors last year. It provides an incentive for those skilled, dedicated committed workers to continue to work and enhance our society.   I want to bring one thing, Mr. Speaker, to the attention of the folks here today; and that is this, we have been told by Mr. Greenspan that one of the greatest threats to the growth in the economy is we do not have enough workers, skilled workers, to produce the supply for the demand that is out there.   This is a very unusual situation that we are in. Thank God for the seniors who are going to bail us out, because this will be an incentive for them. This is critical. This is something that we need, and we are working together finally. By the way, does it not feel good to work well on things that America needs?   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hastert ), the Speaker of the House.   (Mr. HASTERT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. HASTERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, when one looks at the genesis of an idea, why a bill like this comes into being, sometimes it has not just happened overnight. This particular bill, this has been worked on for almost 20 years.   I remember the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) when he first came to Congress talked about this. The gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Armey ) tried to push this concept. He brought together economists that shows there is really a positive effort when people work. The positives, when one does dynamic scoring, really has outshone what the negatives were, and that was the payment is out of the Social Security trust fund.   Then 14 years ago, the 100th Congress decided that this was a project that was something that was important for people. For 14 years, we have been trying to get the Social Security earnings limit, as we call it, changed. We did change it. Twelve years ago, one could earn $10,000; and anything over $10,000, every $2 that one earned one lost a dollar in one's Social Security. Then we kind of phased it out to $3, and it went up from $10,000 to $13,000 to $17,000 today.   But the fact is, when a senior citizen goes to work at McDonald's or starts his or her own little business or, like the lady 10 years ago when I bought Valentine flowers for my wife at the florist shop, she said, Congressman, I had just came back to work in January. I had stopped work last October because I was up against the earnings limit, at that time about $10,000. I had to leave my job. Or the seamstress at the little corner dress shop that the owner came out to me and said, I am going to lose my seamstress because she has reached that earnings limit. That was in November just at a busy time.   So the unfairness of the earnings limit for today's worker certainly has been apparent, and it has been apparent for a long time.   Slowly, but surely, we have been able to move this bill to a point where we can pass it and we can give equity to seniors, people who are over the age of 65 that do not want to relegate themselves to a rocking chair.   Now, quite frankly, some seniors at age 65 want to retire, and God bless them. They should be able if they have had that productive life. But the issue is that seniors who maybe did not have to work by the sweat of their brow their whole life, that they have unearned income, if they have pensions and they have retirement accounts, they were not penalized by the earnings test.   The people that were penalized by the earnings test were people that had to go out and earn by the sweat of their brow, people that were never to save up, never to have an IRA, never to be able to have a lot of money in pensions, people that had to go out and work every day to feed their families, to make ends meet. Now they are 65 years of age and, all of a sudden, they have a big government tell them, oh, by the way, you can get Social Security, but you cannot work anymore.     [Page: H590]     [TIME: 1145]   `You cannot work to send your grandchild or child on to college; you cannot help earn that tuition for your family and, by the way, you cannot have that car that you would like to have to go on vacation because you cannot earn more than this amount of money because you are going to be penalized.'   This is wrong. It has been wrong for a long, long time. And especially in today's economy, when seniors are valued, because it is the seniors that have work ethics. It is the seniors that put in a full day's work, and they know the value of work. People like Sears Roebuck and J. C. Penney and McDonald's, and on and on, have been telling me for over a decade that they want those seniors in their ranks. Because not only are they good workers, people they can depend on, but for people entering the work force they are great people to train. It is a good ethic to pass on.   So we cannot afford to keep this resource, these people who have built this country, these people who want to contribute, even into their retirement, to what America is all about, we cannot afford to keep them out of this process.   I want to again say that I urge everybody to vote for this bill. And I am very pleased that the President has endorsed this piece of legislation. I think it is good, as the gentleman said, that we have found something that we can work on, something that lifts the American people and gives them a better future.   I want to also thank certainly the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) for bringing this legislation up, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ), who has worked on this as a pioneer for years, and  Jim Bunning , who used to be a Member of this body worked on it for years and years. There are a lot of people and a lot of history here.   I think it is time that this bill passes, and I urge everybody to stand up and vote `yes.' Thank heavens this is here, a time of salvation for our seniors.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Shows ).   Mr. SHOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5, to repeal the Social Security earnings limit.   I am pleased finally to have the opportunity to bring this to a vote. After all, House Democrats have long supported repealing the earnings limit, but within the framework of comprehensive Social Security reform, to protect the Social Security Trust Fund and make sure it is there for seniors who need it.   The Republican tax cut actually held the Social Security earnings limit hostage to election year politics. Their proposals would have raided the Social Security surplus to fund huge ill-conceived tax cuts, of which repeal of the earnings limit was one small part.   Seniors will not be fooled by a political effort to tie repealing the Social Security earnings limit to a tax cut that would have been funded by raiding the Social Security surplus.   I support eliminating the earnings limit. More than that, I support being honest with our seniors.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Holt ).   (Mr. HOLT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, bipartisan common sense legislation to repeal the Social Security earnings test.   I believe the Social Security earnings test should be eliminated. Simply put, this provision of the Social Security law has outlived its usefulness. It is a relic from another time. It survives only to punish older Americans for their productivity.   Today, most seniors continue to work at least part time after retiring. These men and women have some of the most dedicated and experienced skills to bring to our work force. And, as a Nation, we should be doing everything we can to encourage them to continue to contribute their time and their talents, not penalize them for doing so.   H.R. 5 would repeal this limit entirely, effective immediately. It is a bill that is worthy of our unanimous support. The President proposed it; both parties support it. It is simple, we need to pass H.R. 5.   We also need to undertake a comprehensive legislative fix that would use the projected budget surpluses to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Allen ).   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of repeal of the earnings limit for Social Security recipients between 65 and 70 years of age.   When I talk to employers in Maine, many cannot find all the employees that they need. Many seniors between 65 and 70 want to work but are discouraged from doing so by the Social Security earnings limit. This bill will help seniors who want to work and employers who want to hire them.   This bill is also an example of what Republicans and Democrats can do when we bring to the floor legislation on which we can agree. In 1998, I voted for a Democratic proposal to lift the earnings limit, but I pointed out at that time that the competing 1998 Republican plan included tax cuts that did not protect Social Security surpluses. That was the wrong approach and I opposed it. This bill is the right approach, and I am proud to support it.     [Page: H591]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Berkley ).   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, to repeal the Social Security earnings test. It is long overdue.   It makes absolutely no sense to penalize older Americans for participating in the work force at any time. It makes particularly no sense to penalize older Americans at a time when businesses are clamoring for qualified workers. Our most experienced workers should not be left out of America's work force, out of America's future.   Many of the seniors in the district I represent in southern Nevada have asked me to champion this issue on their behalf. They have so much energy, so much talent, so much to continue to give this great country. Congress must repeal this obsolete earnings limit and give seniors the freedom to work without penalty.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Coble ).   (Mr. COBLE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this proposal and commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) for their efforts in this endeavor.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins ), a member of the committee.   Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, if we are to climb the mountain of tax reform, we have to take it one step at a time; and I think the right approach is to aim first at individuals and remove the burden of excessive taxation and complicated regulations.   The very first place to start is by scrapping tax penalties. Why hit people with a heavier tax burden for being married, for working after retirement, or for building a family business or farm? The Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is an important step to remove one of those penalties. It will end the Social Security earnings limit which discourage seniors from continuing to work.   This legislation follows an important first step we took a couple of weeks ago with the passage of the marriage penalty tax relief. Finally, I hope that we will take a third step, and that is by helping families by eliminating the death penalty tax which hammers families, family-owned businesses and farms.   Mr. Speaker, let us keep moving forward, making progress in tax reform and support H.R. 5.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Frost ).   Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, legislation that is long overdue for our Nation's seniors.   In 1999, an estimated 1.2 million beneficiaries had some or all of their benefits withheld for some portion of the year under the Social Security earnings test. About 800,000 beneficiaries lost some or all of their benefits under the test as a result of their work at ages 65 to 69. Additionally, the benefits of 150,000 family members were limited or withheld due to the earnings of the primary beneficiary.   Mr. Speaker, for many seniors, working after the age of 65 is not an option. Facing mounting bills for prescription drugs and the increasing cost of living, it is something they must do to continue to pay their bills. We should be doing everything we can to increase the standard of living for these valuable employees.   Older women in particular face a major hardship from the earnings test. The poverty rate for women is higher than the poverty rate overall, and women have a greater reliance on their Social Security benefits for income. Widows account for 66 percent of aged women in poverty. There are 1.2 million aged widows who receive Social Security benefits and have had incomes below the poverty line.   Because women live longer, have lower lifetime earnings and, therefore, for dependent on Social Security benefits, they are more likely to be working well past the traditional retirement age. We need to boost the Social Security earnings for this most vulnerable group of seniors rather than putting roadblocks in their path.   Mr. Speaker, repealing the earnings limit is good for seniors and good for employers too. Older workers are exactly the type of employees that businesses want. They are dependable, experienced, and have a strong work ethic. We should be encouraging these workers to remain in the work force instead of trying to force them out. As the number of older workers grows, and the need for quality employees becomes more acute, we need to take advantage of the experience and skills that older workers provide.   Eliminating the earnings test is not only the fair thing to do for working seniors but it will improve the quality and efficiency of the Social Security program as well.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ramstad ), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill to get rid of the Social Security earnings limit. I have been an original cosponsor of this bill many times, and I am pleased that we have gotten to this point today.   The need for this bill was really brought home to me last Friday. In my district office in Bloomington, Minnesota, a woman named Anna Marie came to see me and said she needed to talk to me about a very personal, very important matter related to Social Security. When she came into my office she was noticeably upset and apprehensive about her situation. She sat down and explained to me that $4,000 had been taken out of her retirement benefits and she desperately needed that money today. In fact, she needed the money for dentures, and if she did not get those new dentures she would be placed on a liquid diet, unable to eat solid food. The $4,000 she had lost would help her afford these dentures and maintain the independence and life-style that she deserves.   When I told her about what Congress would hopefully do today, about the bill before us to remove the Social Security earnings limit, she started to cry. Her eyes welled up with tears, she clasped her hands together and she said, `Praise Jesus. Thank you, God.'   Well, this is an important bill in the lives of real people, real seniors who need that $4,000, who need the money that has been taken by the Federal Government. In voting for it, my colleagues, we help Anna Marie, we help many others like her across the country. In voting for it, to remove the Social Security earnings limit, we will make a real difference in the lives of real seniors, ensuring that not only can they keep the money they earn, that they need, but also the independence that these seniors deserve.   So I hope in a bipartisan way we overwhelmingly pass this legislation before us today.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith ).   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I too rise in strong support of H.R. 5 today. This bill is a win-win situation, not just for seniors but for the country as a whole as well.   Clearly, it is to the great advantage of seniors to have the opportunity to continue to work, to bring in income and not have their Social Security cut.     [TIME: 1200]   It is the right thing to do. Seniors, particularly between 65 and 70, still have a lot of bills and a lot of concerns that Social Security cannot meet. Allowing them to work is a way to help them make that up. But it is also a great benefit to our economy. If there is one thing I hear from every business in my district, it is that they cannot find enough workers. It does not matter what the job is; they cannot find enough people to do the jobs they need.   Well, we have a wealth of talent out there with great experience, and that is our seniors who can fill those jobs and help our economy. This bill is fair to seniors, excellent for the economy, and I recommend that we support it strongly.   I also think it is great that it is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It shows an example of where the House can work together to solve real problems for real people in this country, and I am very proud to support it.     [Page: H592]   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Portman ), an esteemed member of the Committee on Ways and Means and a member of the Subcommittee on Social Security.   Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the time; and I want to thank him and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) and other members of the Committee on Ways and Mean who have put this legislation forward. I rise in very strong support of it, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, properly named, as well.   The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ramstad ) talked earlier about a constituent who had come into his office and talked about the penalty that she now lives under, which is about 4,000 a year, and does not enable her to do things she needs to do for herself.   Let me tell my colleagues another story. And there are so many out there. Each of us knows people in our districts, maybe in our family, who are affected by this. But Marjorie Thompson is a dear friend of mine back home. She is a caregiver. She is a nurse. She takes care of elderly patients primarily. She is a compassionate, a skilled person who has a very strong work ethic and wants to work.   Marjorie is in her late sixties, and she wants to go to work every day. She has come to me and she has said, Rob, should I work? And I have to tell her that her marginal tax rate for every additional dollar she earns now is about 80 percent. She is getting advice now from everybody she knows that say, of course she should not work, not with that kind of penalty.   If we could take away the earnings penalty from her, she would work and she would work a full year and she would not stop when she has reached that cap.   People like Marjorie Thompson are needed. They are needed to care for our elderly. They are needed throughout our economy. These are people that have a lot to contribute. And it is not just economically. They have a lot to contribute to our society. They want to work. They want to have the dignity and the self-respect that comes with work.   The last thing that this Congress and this Government should be doing is discouraging them from working. We have to remove this penalty from the Tax Code. It is overdue.   Again, I commend the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and others, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) who put this forward. And I am really looking forward to its being enacted into law.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Maloney ).   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of repealing the earnings test for Social Security beneficiaries between the ages of 65 and 69.   There is currently a shortage of workers in the U.S. There is no good reason for Social Security to punish people who want to work. These more mature workers are some of our Nation's most skilled.   Mr. Speaker, the earnings limit is a relic of the Depression era. With Americans living longer, Social Security should not dictate their life-style choices to them. This bill is good social policy and good economic policy. It does not make sense to punish Americans for working when Congress is being lobbied to allow additional workers into the country from other countries.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are approaching this in a bipartisan manner; and I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can use this year to address broader reform.   When discussions turn to handling the budget surplus, we must insist that the solvency of Social Security and Medicare are addressed first and that our older citizens have a prescription drug benefit. We should be addressing this now, not adjourning.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Kuykendall ).   Mr. KUYKENDALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this legislation. It is important legislation for our seniors.   Incredibly, seniors between the ages of 65 and 70 currently lose a dollar's worth of Social Security benefits for every $3 earned over $17,000. Seniors should not be penalized for working. It is just plain unconscionable that the Government would take away these hard-earned benefits.   With our powerful economic growth continuing, the need for skilled workers in the workforce is increasing. To have any disincentive to work is bad policy. More than 800,000 working senior citizens lose part or all of their Social Security benefits due to this obsolete provision. And today we can remove the earnings limit.   I am glad to hear also the President recognizes this unfairness in this earnings limit. Ending the earnings limit is good for seniors, good for the Nation; and it is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Sanchez ).   Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5, legislation to repeal the earnings test for Social Security for the ages 65 through 69. It is time to get rid of this penalty, and I am glad that we are finally debating this issue.   The earnings limit originated in the 1930s, but today people remain healthy and vigorous longer than they did then; and it makes sense to repeal this obsolete and punitive limit.   It makes no sense to penalize seniors, some who still have to work in the workplace, some who want to contribute their skills to the workplace, especially in a time when businesses are finding it difficult to recruit enough qualified workers to fill the jobs that remain vacant.   The current system is a disincentive for seniors to continue to work, and it needs to be changed. And this legislation is long overdue.   But there are a lot of other things we also need to work on. We need to help retirees by using the surplus to extend Social Security and Medicare, to provide a prescription drug plan for all seniors, and to lift the limit on outside income for beneficiaries of Social Security.   I have supported raising the limit in the past, and I support repealing it today.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Crane ) a respected member of the Committee on Ways and Means.   Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for yielding to me this time.   I want to say to my colleagues that all of us understand the meaning of the phrase `an honest day's pay for an honest day's work.'   Because of the many, many decades of hard work in all kinds of jobs, our older Americans appreciate that adage more than most. They know what it means to expend a lifetime of dealing with the uncertainties of living paycheck to paycheck. They got up early every morning, went to the assembly line, the office, the shop, and came home at night to enjoy some time with family and friends.   When they were rearing their families, they simply hoped to make life a little better for their children; and when they reached retirement age, they hoped to collect the money they contributed to Social Security and a pension. But if they continue to work after 65, they are forced to watch the Federal Government continue to try to squeeze every cent it can from their paycheck; and to add insult to injury, even their Social Security is affected until they turn 70.   So I proudly stand before my colleagues today because, after decades of trying to eliminate the Social Security earnings limit, it is finally happening on the floor of the House today. This means that the over 42,000 seniors living in my district, many of whom continue working beyond the average retirement age, will be getting a little bit of a break.   On behalf of my 8th District constituents, I want to thank and commend my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ), for his persistence in getting H.R. 5 to the floor for a vote. I want to commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ), our chairman, who was pioneering in this effort years ago. And I want to commend the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), our distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, for all of his efforts. And I commend all of our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, for joining as cosponsors of a bill that my colleagues, I know, will want to unanimously support and eliminate this obscene tax.     [Page: H593]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Clement ).   Mr. CLEMENT. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today that H.R. 5 is moving.   I have been in Congress for several years now, and this is a piece of legislation that I have felt like should have been passed many years ago. And I know senior citizens that have quit work simply because the penalty was too high.   Now they will be able, after this legislation passes the House and Senate and signed by the President, and I expect it all to happen this year and very soon now, where senior citizens will have an opportunity to make some decisions and whereby they can have some structure in their lives, where they can have some peace of mind, knowing that if they want to continue to work, and many of them want to do that, they will be able to accomplish those goals and objectives for themselves and their families.   It is estimated that, under current law, about 4 percent of Social Security recipients will exceed the $17,000 earnings limit and will have the benefits reduced by an average of $8,154. That does not have to happen now with this legislation.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Biggert ).   Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ) and the gentleman from Florida (Chairman  Shaw ) and in support of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act.   The Members of this body have different philosophies about the role of government. Some want an expansive, activist government. Others, like myself, believe that government should have a much more limited role. But I think everyone agrees that the Government should not discourage hard work and self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, we do just that. And nowhere is this more evident than with the so-called Social Security earnings limit.   Incredibly, more than 800,000 working seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 lose part or all of their Social Security benefits simply because they choose to work in their golden years. This is wrong.   No matter what the rationale for the earnings limit was during the Great Depression, this is the year 2000. We should not stand for a Tax Code that penalizes hard work and responsibility.   I urge all my colleagues to support the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hinojosa ).   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I want to say how glad I am that today we have an opportunity to vote to repeal the earnings test for Social Security beneficiaries between the ages of 65 and 69. This action is long overdue.   The earnings limit originated in the 1930s when the Social Security program was started during the Depression, and it remains despite the vast changes in the economy and the lives of senior citizens that have taken place over the last 60 years.   It makes no sense to penalize seniors for participating in the workplace, especially at a time when businesses cannot find enough qualified workers to fill jobs that remain vacant. People remain healthy and vigorous longer than they did in the 1930s. So it makes perfect sense to repeal this obsolete and punitive limit.   By passing this bill, seniors who need or want to work can now do so without the fear of being punished by an outdated law.   I am glad that today we, both sides of the aisle, can all be on the same page and finally take this action. Let us vote `yes' to pass H.R. 5.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Minge ).   Mr. MINGE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from California for yielding the time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I join in the parade of Members who support this legislation. Previously, this proposal to lift the earnings limit has been used as a partisan Trojan horse. It included tax cuts that were controversial, and it would have required raiding the Social Security trust fund.   Today we have a balanced budget, we are not engaged in a raid on the Social Security trust fund, and we can approve this proposal on its merits. It is not a Trojan horse. It is not accompanied by other controversial Internal Revenue Code changes.   Strong policy considerations support this legislation. They have been amply stated by previous speakers. I would just like to say them briefly: fairness to seniors who wish to work. We should encourage a work ethics. Two, it is budget neutral. This proposal does not cost money. Three, we have a labor shortage. We need additional workers in America.     [TIME: 1215]   I am pleased to join in supporting this legislation.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Wu ).   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. Under current law, seniors who earn more than $17,000 per year are penalized $1 for every $3 of additional earnings. This is wrong. We should not penalize hard work. It makes no sense to penalize seniors who are participating in our work force, especially at a time when we cannot find enough workers to fill a burgeoning economy.   I have heard from many small businesses in my district that are very excited about the possibility of hiring additional workers, workers who have solid work values, who are responsible, experienced and eager to fill the positions which are currently available.   As we vote on this important bipartisan legislation today, I want to encourage my colleagues to continue work in assisting our seniors to retire so they are not forced to work. However, I strongly believe that those who choose to work should not be penalized. And this bill solves that.   I urge my colleagues to support this long-needed legislation.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Stenholm ), the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Agriculture.   (Mr. STENHOLM asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation and encourage all of my colleagues to support it. I have been a strong supporter of legislation to repeal the earnings limit for several years. In fact, repeal of the earnings limit was part of the comprehensive Social Security reform package that I introduced, along with the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Kolbe ) in 1998.   Our legislation though contained several other provisions that rewarded individuals who continued to work after retirement age. While I am disappointed that Congress is not acting on the other parts of our proposal to strengthen Social Security, I am very pleased that this part of our legislation is going to be enacted today.   Senior citizens are some of our most valued workers, contributing a wealth of experience that can be gained only through years of dedicated service. For this reason, I agree wholeheartedly with the statement of former Senator Bentsen that discouraging seniors citizen from working is `like keeping your best hitters on the bench.'   Our society should not overlook the contribution of our seniors. Unfortunately, press reports suggest that some in the Republican party intend to use this vote on the earnings limit for partisan political purposes. I would ask a reconsideration of those who choose to do that.   As Democrats who have worked in a bipartisan way on comprehensive Social Security reform, I am extremely disappointed by these reports and hope that the Republican leadership will repudiate these tactics. The suggestions that Democrats have opposed repeal of the Social Security earnings limit are completely false.   Democrats have supported repeal of the Social Security earnings limit as part of a comprehensive legislation that keeps Social Security strong for those currently retired or close to it, and everyone knows that.   In fact, the reported line of criticism being suggested by some actually raises questions about their commitment to the integrity of the Social Security trust fund. The votes being cited to criticize Democrats were on bills that would have raided the Social Security surplus to fund tax cuts, in which repeal of the earnings limit was one small part.   Seniors will not be fooled by a political effort to use the issue of repealing the Social Security earnings limit to advocate a tax cut that would have been funded by raiding the Social Security surplus.   The past votes that some Republicans seek to exploit for political purposes were on bills that would have threatened the integrity of the Social Security trust fund. The $80 billion tax cut considered by the House in the fall of 1998 that included repeal of the Social Security earnings limit would have been funded entirely out of the Social Security surplus.   The Republican leadership at that time did not even allow a vote on the Stenholm-Neumann amendment, which provided that the tax cuts could not be funded with a Social Security surplus. Likewise, the tax bill considered by the House last year would have dipped into the Social Security surplus by more than $70 billion and would have exploded in costs at the same time the Social Security system is projected to begin running shortfalls.   Let us use today to set aside the bipartisanship. Let us recognize that today we are reaching out in a bipartisan way in order to do what everyone has agreed. While I am critical of the fact we are not doing more, we accept this today, let us put the partisanship aside. Let us continue to reach out for a long-term solution for Social Security.     [Page: H594]   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Dunn ), a respected member of the committee.   Ms. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the seniors and near seniors in the Congressional district that I represent, I rise today in enthusiastic support of H.R. 5, the Seniors Citizens' Freedom to Work Act.   The Social Security earnings limit is another aspect of a 60-year old Social Security system that no longer applies to modern society. These days seniors are living longer. They are healthier, and yet too many of our Nation's best workers are sitting in rocking chairs.   We need their strength. We need their experience in our communities. And young people starting new jobs need their example, their example of the value of work and the discipline of work. Unfortunately, by denying retirement benefits for those who choose to work, Social Security penalizes seniors who want to be productive and teach the values of hard work to younger generations.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is also very important to women who, 75 percent of the time, live longer than their spouses. And they ought to be able to have the peace of mind that they can supplement their retirement earnings if they wish without being penalized.   In Washington State alone, more than 13,000 seniors have been forced to choose between keeping the job they love or losing the retirement income for which they worked all their lives. This is wrong. It also keeps an intelligent and productive part of our work force at home.   Seniors who are currently retired have been called the greatest generation, for the sacrifices they made in defending freedom and building America into the world's only remaining superpower. It is time that we honor the contributions to America, their contributions, by allowing them to work, if they wish, and to give one of the most precious gifts of all, that they can offer their work ethic.   I want to congratulate the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) for persevering in this cause. I want to urge my colleagues to support this bill and the President to sign it.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Gephardt ), the Democratic leader.   (Mr. GEPHARDT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. GEPHARDT. Mr. Speaker, today we are taking the first step towards strengthening retirement security for all seniors and moving closer to putting Social Security on a firmer footing for the rest of the century. This time, we are doing it in a fiscally responsible way.   I am gratified that Republicans are joining with us to repeal the earnings test for Social Security. This is truly a bipartisan effort. Democrats have overwhelmingly voted three times in recent years to raise the limit and President Clinton has requested repealing this earnings limit in his last two budgets. The sooner we send this to his desk, the faster we will be able to deliver this relief to seniors who want to continue making a real contribution to our society and our economy.   Unlike a Republican attempt to raise the limit in 1998, the bill we debate today does not hurt the long-term solvency of Social Security to do so. This reform is long overdue. It is about time that we stand up for America's seniors.   According to Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, we are beginning to suffer from a serious worker shortage that threatens our economic expansion. This bill will play a major role in protecting our economic gains of the last 7 years. It will not only help raise the standard of living for many of our seniors but it will also help us keep the strongest economic growth of our lifetime on track by keeping a generation of skilled workers in the economy.   I met with a number of small business owners in South County St. Louis in my district this past weekend and they talked about their need to hire workers over the age of 65 because they are having such trouble finding skilled workers for jobs that are available right now. This bill will encourage seniors to return to the workplace and enable business owners to fill vacant jobs.   This earnings limit is a relic of the great depression when we experienced double-digit unemployment among young people. The limit does not make any sense in the year 2000. It needs to be relegated to the dustbin of economic history. This is just the first step towards strengthening retirement security for all seniors. Now it is time to take the next step, using the surplus to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare.   Today, we are voting to allow working seniors to fully enjoy their Social Security benefit, but that very benefit will be in danger if Republicans do not join with Democrats to take immediate action to strengthen the Social Security trust fund with an infusion of financial support.   I hope my Republican colleagues will join us over the next several months in using the surplus to strengthen both Social Security and Medicare. This bill shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together to rebuild and build retirement security. I hope that we can build on this foundation and work together to put Social Security and Medicare on a sound financial footing well into the next century.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Gilman ).   (Mr. GILMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. GILMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This bill is simple and straightforward, removing the earnings limit for working seniors receiving Social Security. Seniors aged 65 to 69 who have chosen to continue to work have had their Social Security benefits reduced by $1 for every $3 earned when their total earnings went over $17,000 annually.   The 104th Congress made a long needed change, raising the annual earnings limit to $30,000 by the year 2002. More needed to be done on this issue. Ever since coming to Washington in the 93rd Congress, I have introduced legislation to either raise the earnings limit or eliminate it altogether. These earnings limits have discouraged seniors from working and diminished their potential productivity, conveying a message that seniors have nothing to contribute and are better off not working in the workforce. It is gratifying that the President has stated his support for the elimination of the earnings limit, and I commend the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) for their attention to this important issue.   Accordingly, I urge our colleagues to join in supporting this timely, important senior legislation.     [Page: H595]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Lucas ).   (Mr. LUCAS of Kentucky asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. LUCAS of Kentucky. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. The elimination of the Social Security earnings limit is a reform that is long overdue.   Under the current system, senior citizens are forced to choose between the loss of their Social Security benefits and dropping out of the workforce. What a terrible message to send to our seniors that their work is not valued. With their wealth of information and experience, senior citizens are a truly vital part of the stability of our workforce and the development of the workforce of tomorrow.   The current limit takes away the benefits from those who have rightfully earned them through a lifetime of hard work. We should not be punishing our senior citizens for continuing to work but, rather, encouraging them. That is just common sense.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rush ).   (Mr. RUSH asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. RUSH. I want to thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time, and I want to commend him for his leadership on this very, very important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This Social Security earnings limit is wrong and archaic. Why penalize able-bodied senior Americans who can work? At a time when our economy is in need of an experienced workforce, we should not be turning our backs on seniors who have valuable experience and skills.   The worst part of the earnings limit is that it penalizes poor senior citizens. Mr. Speaker, not every senior who retires has private pensions to supplement their Social Security benefits.     [TIME: 1230]   Health costs are rising; prescription drugs are unattainable. Seniors need to work to supplement their Social Security benefits. No longer should we force seniors to choose between food and medicine. Do not deny our seniors their basic rights. We must do away with this archaic earnings limit which deprives our seniors of their earned benefits.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ose )   Mr. OSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5. I came to this Congress recently following in the great footsteps of my colleague, the gentleman from Sacramento, California (Mr.  Matsui ), and I want to specifically applaud the fact that after 40 years of Democratic majority here and 6 years of Republican majority, we finally have been able to move a bill out of the House, hopefully on to the Senate, and then to the President for signature.   This particular issue, where we in effect tax the ability of our seniors to contribute to our workforce disproportionately, has needed to be changed since it was first passed in the Depression. There is no argument about that. There is no getting around that fact.   Again, we spent 40 years under the tutelage of one party, and now 6 years we have been at it here. We finally have agreement, and I am happy to be part of this. This is one of the things I campaigned on, to try and get this tax off the backs of our seniors. I welcome my friends on the other side to this. I am very, very pleased to be here with the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) in this effort.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.  Pomeroy ).   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I would echo the comments just made by my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ose ). It is fun for a change to participate in a debate on a bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support, improving the Social Security program that we have for our seniors.   It is time we lift the earnings limit. We need to do this as part of a multifaceted approach at improving income in retirement years. This approach needs to include other activity by this Congress, activity where hopefully we would come together also in a bipartisan way to strengthen Social Security, making certain that it is going to be there for the long run, and coming together in a bipartisan way to help additional employers offer retirement savings opportunities for their workplace. Presently, only half the workers have retirement savings at work. We need to do better, and there are strategies introduced and supported by Members of both parties to get this done as well.   Finally, we need to come together to add additional savings incentives, targeted specifically at middle-income and lower-income households, so that they might save for retirement.   But back to today's bill. Today's bill really is for those that hit retirement years without enough savings already accrued. Those years, 65 to 70, represent an important last opportunity to get some additional income, even while the Social Security checks start coming, so that they might build that nest egg, to meet their needs, to keep them comfortable as they go on.   Do you know that today someone reaching the age of 65 has an additional 15 years of life expectancy if they are a male, and 19 years if they are a female? Surely there are substantial needs for a retirement nest egg in light of that kind of life-span opportunity. In addition, we know that people reaching the age of 65 today are healthier, more engaged and want to work than ever before; and we ought to give them that opportunity.   Additionally, we know that in light of our strong economy, the needs in the workforce are intense, and this potential source of labor can help employer after employer, right across the country.   In my own State, the State of North Dakota, people over the age of 60 represent 18 percent of our population. Clearly we need their participation. That is important today, but it is only going to grow more important, because this over-60 segment will swell by 60 percent in North Dakota by the year 2025. Quite frankly, I do not know how we will keep our schools going. I do not know how we will keep some of the businesses going if we do not have workers in this age span, 65 to 70, participating if they want to in the workforce without the absolutely ruinous penalty presented by the tax on earnings today.   For every reason I have mentioned, I urge a unanimous vote on this. What a pleasure it is to have this bipartisan achievement.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Horn ).   (Mr. HORN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, today this House of Representatives will take a real step toward tax reform for America's working retirees. By repealing the so-called Social Security earnings test, we are doing away with an outdated law that affects over 800,000 seniors who have been denied the needed income to survive in their golden years.   Created in the Depression to encourage older workers to move out of the job market, the earnings limit is an antiquated solution to a problem that no longer exists. Many of today's seniors want to take part in this economic boom, but are penalized $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn beyond $17,000. My State of California is hit hardest by the earnings test, affecting over 161,000 seniors. When seniors are denied the opportunity to work and governments are denied income taxes generated by seniors working, we all lose.   Mr. Speaker, I have long believed the outright repeal of this law was the right thing to do, and I am pleased to have an opportunity today to be part of the team that will send the bill to the Senate and the President that lowers the tax burden for so many working retirees.     [Page: H596]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bonior ), the Democratic whip.   Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, first of all let me congratulate my two friends, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ), for their fine work in bringing this forward today.   Mr. Speaker, today we have the chance to take action to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, a law so outdated few can remember how it ever got on the books.   What is the Social Security earnings limit? Well, ask any senior and they will tell you the earning limit is a Catch-22 of the Social Security system. It is a law that actually punishes older people for working. In fact, it forces them, literally forces them, to become more dependent on Social Security than they need to be.   Now, why would anybody want a law like that? Well, Mr. Speaker, I do not know any of us who want a law like that, and it is time for a change. That is why we are repealing it today.   Our message for every American, no matter how old, ought to be that if you want a job and you are able to do a job, by God, this government is never going to try to stop you from getting a job.   We are voting to repeal the earnings limit because in this incredible economy, there is more than enough work that needs to be done, and older Americans may be just some of the people who can do it and do it well in a labor market that is struggling for good, competent, qualified people.   We are voting to repeal the earnings limit not only because we believe older people ought to have the right to earn higher incomes, but because they deserve the opportunity to live richer lives, lives made better by the opportunity to join the world of work. But, Mr. Speaker, the truth is that it is not just seniors who win if we repeal this foolish law; we all win. We all win because this Nation needs the experience, the skill and the maturity of older people that they can bring to the American workplace.   Older Americans today are one of this Nation's greatest resources. It is high time we take advantage of it. This is a win-win proposition for America.   Again, I want to congratulate my colleagues for bringing this to the floor.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Stearns ).   (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, back in the 1930s the reason for starting the earnings test the Democrats said it was necessary to allow younger workers to work. Today what we have is a shortage of qualified and experienced workers, so it is very appropriate that we are getting around to enacting this legislation.   I might point out I am glad to see the minority party supports this piece of legislation. For almost 4 decades the Democratic party did not seem to want to initiate and to pass this legislation; and the chairman here, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), and others on this side, worked so hard to try and pass this. So this is a great day, to see the folks on the other side of the aisle say let's pass it by unanimous agreement.   There is no good reason, of course. There is no longer a reason for this antiquated law to be on the books. It is discriminatory.   So I support the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. I am an original cosponsor of it. It is a law we have to be very joyful this afternoon for, because it is a law that is needed.                Mr. Speaker, since the Social Security program was created in 1935, it has always included an earnings test.  There have been many efforts through the years to eliminate the earnings test, but none were successful.         Back in the 1930's the reason given for starting the earnings test was to `open up jobs' for younger workers.  What we are currently experiencing is a shortage of qualified and experienced workers. The time to act is now.         In 1996 I voted to increase the earnings limit for seniors who chose to continue working. We were able to increase  the earnings limit for those aged 65-69 to $30,000 by the year 2002. At the time this legislation was passed, a  working senior who reached $11,280 in earned income lost $1 in Social Security for each $3 earned thereafter. That's  a marginal tax rate of 33%! That's a high price to pay for merely wanting to work.         Let's take a look at how the current law affects our nation's seniors who are receiving Social Security benefits  and also working. This year beneficiaries aged 65-69 can earn up to $17,000 without being penalized. They lose  one dollar for every three of earnings that exceed this limit.         Beneficiaries aged 62-64, those individuals who retire early, are allowed to earn up to $10,080 this year without  a penalty. They lose one dollar of Social Security benefits for every two dollars they earn above the imposed limit.  While the measure we passed in 1996 made vast improvements to the earnings test, our real goal at that time was  to repeal the law outright. I believe that we will be successful this time around.         What's wrong with giving elderly workers who either want to work or must work in order to maintain a decent  lifestyle the ability to do so. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 5 that would repeal the Social Security earnings  test entirely. I have long been a proponent of repealing this outdated provision and shall continue to support  such proposals until we succeed in changing this law.         The earnings test limit is unjust. It treats Social Security benefits less like a pension and more like welfare.  It represents a Social Security bias in favor of unearned income over earned income.         It is effectively a mandatory retirement mechanism our country no longer accepts or needs. It precludes greater  flexibility for the elderly worker and also prevents America's full use of eager, experienced and educated elderly  workers. Finally, it deprives the U.S. Economy of the additional income tax which would be generated by the elderly  workers.         There is no good reason to keep this antiquated and discriminatory law in existence any longer. I support swift  passage of the Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act and call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  for this very important and long overdue change in the law.     Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Capps ).   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and join my colleagues in strong support of this legislation, and I commend the leadership of this House, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ). It is a good day when we can be so united in a bipartisan way to end an unfair tax on our working seniors.   Mr. Speaker, many seniors work because they need to. They should not be penalized for trying to put food on their table. They should be supported. Seniors in my district have been telling me this is something that they need. Some seniors work because they want to. They should not be penalized for remaining active and involved. These seniors should be supported as well. Our country is the richer for it.   It is time to act in this way. Today we will have, I hope, unanimous support to remove this onerous burden on working seniors and end the earnings limit. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Hefley ).   Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago this House voted to right a wrong. Most of us agree it is unfair for a married couple to be penalized by the Federal Government just simply because they are married, so we passed legislation to fix that unfairness. Today it is time to fix another long-standing unfairness, the Social Security earnings limit.   Mr. Speaker, it is about time. For too long we have penalized our most experienced workers, created disincentives for them to work, oftentimes when their employers need their expertise the most. No American should be penalized for their desire to work and contribute to the economy and strength of our country, least of all our seniors.   In 1987, my class in Congress, the Republican members of my class, voted to take this on as a project, to try to eliminate the earnings limit. We met with Dan Rostenkowski. I think it was the only time he ever spoke to me, but we met with Dan Rostenkowski, and he said, `No, we won't do it.' So over the years we have picked away at it with the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) and various ones, and with their help picked away at it and made it better. But today is a chance to get rid of it.   For the sake of simple fairness, it is time for this body to eliminate the earnings limit. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.     [Page: H597]   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Traficant ).   (Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, Dan Rostenkowski would not do it. He is a Democrat. I am embarrassed by it.   I want to commend the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ) and the gentleman from Florida (Chairman  Shaw ). I want to commend the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ).   But, Mr. Speaker, this is not enough. Everybody is reaching into that Social Security trust fund and they are raiding it. I have a bill and it calls for a constitutional amendment, and it says you cannot touch the Social Security trust fund. It can only be used for Social Security and Medicare. If we pass that, we would have enough money to provide health insurance for every American.   But I want to pay tribute to the Republican Party today. Rostenkowski did not do it, Rostenkowski would not do it, and the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ) and the gentleman from Florida (Chairman  Shaw ) did it. But the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ) deserve a lot of credit for making it happen as well.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson-Lee ).     [TIME: 1245]   Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.   I would like to add my applause and appreciation to the gentleman from Texas (Chairman  Archer ) and the ranking member, the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ), to the gentleman from Florida (Chairman  Shaw ), and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ), for their vision.   This bill spells relief. I have spent some time with seniors, most of us do as we visit our senior citizen centers, as we work with seniors in our respective religious communities, as we work with seniors as our neighbors.   I can actually say that the retirement earnings test keeps good talent away from the job market. This legislation will allow thousands of social security recipients to work without a reduction in their benefits, to work in child care, to work in volunteer programs, after-school programs.   In fact, as I visited the Latino Learning Center and their Senior Citizen Center, they were making crafts. Although that is not employment per se, it still might have impacted their income by way of the income being attributable to each individual from the crafts that they made.   The repealing of this will in fact increase work incentives; will put good, strong, valued seniors in the workplace, and will add to the value of what they have already given to the workplace and this Nation. Repealing the RET will not affect social security's finances over the long run, and in particular, repealing the RET will make the social security program easier and less expensive to administer.   This is long overdue. As I have said when I have come to the floor before, this spells relief. It is relief for seniors, for the social security program, for the community where these valuable seniors can be out and about in the work force contributing to this Nation as they have done in the past.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as I may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Gallegly ).   (Mr. GALLEGLY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. GALLEGLY. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of this legislation. It is a bill we have worked on for many years.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. I just again would like to thank Members for the bipartisan atmosphere that occurs on the floor of the House, as it did in subcommittee and in the full committee. The fact that we have moved this bill in an expedited fashion certainly means that we should get it to the President in a timely fashion so that it will become law in the year 2000. Again, this is a much needed change in the social security system.   I might just add, just so there is no misunderstanding, that this will have a $23 billion revenue loss out of the social security system over the next 10 years. But over the life of the social security system itself, because of the delayed credit, it will have no impact on the solvency of the social security system, so this has no impact on the social security system nor on the Medicare system.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ), the distinguished ranking Democrat on the Committee on Ways and Means.   (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ) for the way he has handled this, not only on the floor, but certainly, as the ranking member of the subcommittee on social security.   It gives me an opportunity to once again congratulate my long and dear friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Shaw ), who showed an interest in social security generally, and this type of cooperation between our parties still gives me some ray of hope, no matter how small that glimmer may be, as we move forward on our political calendar, that there are many other things that we can accomplish in working together.   For those people who believe that it is in our best interest to have confrontation and do nothing, I suggest that at the polling places, both Democrats and Republicans may suffer. It seems to me that there have been enough suggestions made by the President that Republicans can pick and choose those that they feel comfortable with, those that they think are in the best interests of the people of this great country, and to be able to work with us to do it.   This is a classic example of the leadership of the chairman and the subcommittee chairman, in working with us so that we can get things done. I laud the Members for this effort, and I look forward to working with them on other issues that remain within the budget, as this has, that do not invite and encourage a veto, but those things that we know that we can work out our differences on, not only on both sides of the aisle but also on Pennsylvania Avenue.   Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make an observation which I think is something that all of us have sort of made reference to, but not particularly in this regard. Some who are looking on today, tuning in on C-Span, probably think they have the wrong channel.   This has been, I think, a real landmark in what we can accomplish in this Congress by working together.   My good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ), and we use that phrase a little flip around here, because when we refer to someone as our good friend, that is about the time we are about to drop a hammer on them, but we are good friends. We are very good friends. We have been for many years, as I am with the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ).   The gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ) I think has been an incredible chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, and we have brought things together that have made a real difference, and we do come together on things that we can politically agree upon.   There should be no disagreement in this country, no disagreement, that people who work their entire working lives, when they reach retirement age, just simply because they have to work beyond that or just simply want to work beyond that, that they should not be penalized. We agree on that. We ought to constantly look out and reach out for things that we agree upon, because it is so important to such an important segment of our population. It is so important.   So this bill is going to pass. I am going to ask for a recorded vote, because I want all the Members to have the opportunity to step forward on the Democrat and the Republican side and cast their vote, a recorded vote, to say they are in favor of American seniors. They are working with us, and we are working together to make a better life for the senior citizens of the country.   This bill takes effect on January 1 of the year 2000. That means exactly 2 months ago this bill comes into effect. The senior citizens of this country will enjoy the fruits and labor of what we have started here today.   I am pleased to say that the President is with us. Yesterday, while we were marking this bill up in the Committee on Ways and Means, the President was in Miami Beach doing a fundraiser for my opponent at a cocktail party. In fact, I thought it was rather ironic, because it was taking place at the exact time we were voting on this bill.   That is the way the system works. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with Democrat presidents supporting Democrat candidates and Republican presidents supporting Republican candidates.   I will tell the Members that I would certainly guess, and as tradition has it, just as we did in welfare reform and other pieces of meaningful legislation that has come out of this Congress, that the President will invite the Republicans down to take part in the bill's signing. That is the way it should be.   So many people here can take credit for what is going on here today. I am very pleased and proud that it happens during the Republican majority, but we have come together. We have locked away the social security surplus so we are no longer spending it. This makes America's great pension program available for the seniors without penalty.   This is a wonderful thing that has happened. This country has gone through a great transition, and when it comes to working together to make things happen, the best of us comes out when we work together.   I want to publicly thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rangel ) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Matsui ), and of course, my chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Archer ), and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sam Johnson ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson ) for the work that they did in bringing this thing together. This is truly a bipartisan effort. It is truly in the best tradition of the American democracy.              [Page: H598]       Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer my support to the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act (H.R. 5),  which repeals the Social Security `earnings limitations.' During a time when an increasing number of senior citizens  are able to enjoy productive lives well past retirement age and businesses are in desperate need of experienced  workers, it makes no sense to punish seniors for working. Yet the federal government does just that by deducting  a portion of seniors' monthly Social Security check should they continue to work and earn income above an arbitrary  government-set level.         When the government takes money every month from people's paychecks for the Social Security Trust Fund, it  promises retirees that the money will be there for them when they retire. The government should keep that promise  and not reduce benefits simply because a senior chooses to work.         Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, by providing a disincentive to remaining in the workforce, the earnings limitation  deprives the American economy of the benefits of senior citizens who wish to continue working but are discouraged  from doing so by fear of losing part of their Social Security benefits. The federal government should not discourage  any citizen from seeking or holding productive employment.         The underlying issue of the earnings limitation goes back to the fact that money from the trust fund is routinely  spent for things other than paying pensions to beneficiaries. This is why the first bill I introduced in the 106th  Congress was the Social Security Preservation Act (H.R. 219), which forbids Congress from spending Social Security  funds on anything other than paying Social Security pensions.         In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I wish to reiterate my strong support for the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act.  Repealing the `earnings limitation' will help ensure that America's seniors can continue to enjoy fulfilling and  productive lives in their `golden years.' I also urge my colleagues to protect the integrity of the Social Security  Trust Fund by cosponsoring the Social Security Preservation Act (H.R. 219).         Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support for H.R. 5, The Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work  Act of 1999. This long overdue measure would allow persons aged 65 through 69 to continue working without losing  some of their Social Security benefits.         Today, our seniors are more healthy and vigorous than ever. Many seniors who choose to continue to work find  that working greatly enhances their retirement years. They are living longer and often finding that they either  need or want to work well beyond traditional retirement age. Further, the time has come to stop penalizing seniors  who need to keep working to supplement their Social Security incomes.         This legislation, which I cosponsored, would do away with this antiquated and obsolete punitive limit to Social  Security payments. Under current law, senior citizens in this age group lose $1 in Social Security benefits for  every $3 they earn each year above a certain level, which is $17,000 this year. The earnings test was designed  during the Great Depression to encourage older workers to leave the workforce to create more jobs for younger workers.  Today, we are experiencing a labor shortage, not a surplus. With our economy's emphasis on increased productivity,  older workers have the years of experience and work ethic that are in great demand.         It is estimated that initially about 600,000 seniors would be affected by the elimination of the earnings test.  According to the Social Security Administration, H.R. 5 will increase Social Security outlays by $17 billion over  5 years and $26 billion over 10 years. However, in the long term, the measure's cost would be negligible because  of offsetting effects because retirees would no longer receive delayed retirement credits, which under current  law compensate for the benefits lost to the earnings test applied to workers above the full retirement age, and  the savings from this would offset the cost from eliminating the earnings test.         Lifting the limit on outside income for beneficiaries of retirement security is a key component of my initiatives  to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare. H.R. 5 is crucial as part of a broader plan that uses the opportunity  of a surplus to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt.         In 1998, the Republican leadership brought an increase in the earnings limit to the floor attached to a tax  bill that would have been financed by borrowing directly from the Social Security Trust Fund. I opposed this bill  funded by the Social Security surplus, and supported an alternative that provided for an increase in the Social  Security earnings limit identical to the one in the Republican bill, but not from the Social Security surplus.  Unfortunately, the bill failed to be enacted.                  H.R. 5 builds upon a bipartisan measure enacted in 1996 which I supported, the Senior Citizens' Right to Work  Act (H.R. 3136), which provided for increases in the amounts of allowable earnings under the Social Security earnings  limit for individuals who have attained retirement age. Now we are going a step further and eliminating the cap  altogether. This is the right policy at the right time.         The earnings test is a relic of the Great Depression and the time has come to terminate it. The test is a severe  disincentive for older people to work. Not only do older workers suffer a reduction in their standard of living  because of the test, the nation's economy loses valuable experience and skills as well.         Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act.         This important legislation is long overdue. The earnings limit is a relic of an era when America was in a state  of extreme economic despair. Mr. Speaker, today we are experiencing unprecedented prosperity. Our economy is booming.  Our unemployment rate is lower than it has been in 30 years. It just doesn't make sense to discourage our nation's  seniors from continuing to contribute to our economy by reducing their Social Security benefits.         Many of the seniors in my home state of Illinois continue to contribute to their communities through hard work.  Repealing the earnings limit will have a very real impact on these seniors. Instead of being punished for their  participation in the workforce, seniors should be encouraged to remain working. Eliminating the earnings test makes  sense. It will be good for our seniors and good for our economy. And most importantly, we can do it without jeopardizing  the future of Social Security. It is something that all of us, on both sides of the aisle, should be able to agree  on.         But, once again, Republicans are playing politics with the issues that affect our nation's seniors the most.  They are clamoring to point fingers at Democrats who have long been in support of amending the archaic earnings  limit. But our nation's seniors cannot be fooled. Democrats support repealing the earnings limit while protecting  the integrity of Social Security.         In the 105th Congress, the Republicans brought an increase of the earning limits to the floor but attached  it to a risky tax cut package that would have put Social Security in severe jeopardy. Democrats strongly opposed  that bill and offered a measure to raise the earnings limit and make the remaining tax cuts contingent on protecting  the solvency of Social Security. This Democratic alternative was a responsible tax cut package that did not raid  the Social Security Trust Fund. Not one Republican voted for this measure. This is just one of many cases that  demonstrates who is on the side of seniors in this fight.         We must stop the finger pointing and come together to protect Social Security for generations to come. This  is not the time for politics as usual. The livelihood of our nation's senior citizens is at stake.       [Page: H599]       Mr. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act  of 2000.         Under current law, over 8,000 Kansas seniors lose some or all of their Social Security benefits due to the  Social Security earnings limit because they choose to continue to work. Seniors aged 65 to 69 have $1 of their  benefits reduced for every $3 they earn over the current earnings limit of $17,000. Simply, current law penalizes  seniors for working. I do not believe it is fair to punish those seniors who want or need to participate in the  workforce by having this disincentive to work.         Eliminating the earnings limit is not only fair for working seniors, it will improve the quality and efficiency  of Social Security since the program will be easier and less expensive to administer. Furthermore, repealing the  Social Security earnings limit is fiscally responsible. While the bill would increase Social Security spending  by $22.7 billion over the next 10 years, the resulting lower long-term benefit payments will more than offset the  costs.         Mr. Speaker, by allowing seniors who want to work to retain their benefits, Congress will take an important  step towards strengthening retirement security for all seniors. This step, however, should not be our last. I urge  my colleagues to begin working with me, in the same bipartisan manner that we worked on today's bill, to put Social  Security on a firm financial footing for future generations. We need to build on today's success by dedicating  a substantial portion of the budget surplus to pay down debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.         I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5 and to join me in the larger challenge of strengthening Social Security  and Medicare for our seniors and for generations of future retirees.                  Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, today, we take an important step forward in addressing a Social Security inequity  that is an injustice to working seniors. Under the Social Security Earnings Limit, beneficiaries aged 65-69 can  earn up to $17,000 a year--but for every $3 earned over this amount $1 of benefits is lost.         The cap has always been one of the most unpopular parts of the Social Security program--and for good reason.  It penalizes older people for working--and deprives the nation of the talent of working seniors. It's time to get  rid of it, once and for all.         The earnings cap is a relic of the Great Depression, when concern over massive joblessness led to a perception  that retirees should be discouraged from rejoining the workforce. Today, people are living longer and working longer--and  are as entitled as the rest of us to fair wages for their labor.         At a time when unemployment is at a 30-year low and we face acute labor shortages, this Depression-era work  disincentive for seniors no longer makes sense.         Older Americans possess enormous talent and experience. It boggles the mind why we'd want to maintain disincentives  for them to work. The earnings test not only erodes seniors' standards of living, but also costs the nation valuable  skills in the workforce, as well as tax revenue generated by this income.         Retirees who receive income from other sources such as pensions or capital gains do not have any benefits reduced.  Why should income from pensions or investments be treated more favorably than earned income?         I received a letter last summer from a retiree from my home town--Quincy, Massachusetts. He wrote: `I would  like to retire with dignity and only want what I deserve. I feel that with your support of this bill, it would  enable me to live without worries of finances and diminish the concerns of my family.'         That is what this legislation is all about--simply giving seniors what they deserve.         While this is a step in the right direction, seniors deserve more--and we could and should be doing more--much  more.         During Committee deliberations on this legislation last night, an amendment was offered to restore some of  the benefits that are reduced due to the Government Pension Offset. This provision would have made widow's benefits  more fair, and helped reduce the high rates of poverty that especially face elderly women.         Unfortunately, the Chairman passed on this opportunity--even though the Social Security Administration stated  that the costs of adding this provision would be negligible.         Mr. Speaker, removing the earnings limit is progress--but is this all that we are going to do for seniors this  year?         Are we going to address other inequities in the Social Security system--like the government pension offset,  windfall reductions, duel entitlement provisions--or even the long-term solvency of the program?         Will we finally reauthorize the Older American Act?         Will we enact a Medicare prescription drug benefit?         Our senior citizens deserve more--much more. Passing this bill is the very least we can do. I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation--and invite you to join me in efforts to ensure retirement security for all older Americans.         Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 5, the `Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act.'         For years my constituents have raised concerns about unfair Social Security earnings limit. Finally, the House  is going to eliminate this unfair penalty.         Whenever a working retiree earns more than $17,000 per year, they lose $1 of Social Security benefits for every  $3 they earn above the limit. We penalize senior citizens who want to continue to participate in the work force.         There are 800,000 senior citizens who lose part or all of the Social Security benefits they've worked hard  for because they earn `too much' money in retirement.         The Social Security earnings limit was created during the Great Depression and it punishes senior citizens  for their work ethic and desire to be self-reliant in their `golden years.'         Today unemployment is at an all-time low. The experience and skills developed by older workers during a lifetime  in the workplace are being recognized and are in demand.         Social Security recipients are entitled to their benefits because they earned them during a lifetime of hard  work. The government should not take those benefits away because individuals want to work. That's why I strongly  support the passage of H.R. 5 today.                  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act  (H.R. 5). The Social Security earnings limit discourages those on retirement from remaining in the work force and  contributing to the country's economic growth. Due to the longer life-spans and the improved quality of health  among retirees, the advent of an aging society, and decreasing work force growth numbers, it is imperative that  we explore better ways to tap the vauable and often underutilized resources of older Americans.         Due to the retirement earnings test, Social Security beneficiaries who have attained the normal retirement  age (presently age 65) have their benefits reduced by $1 for every $3 that they earn in excess of $17,000. Similarly,  Social Security beneficiaries between age 62 and the normal retirement age have their benefits reduced by $1 for  every $2 that they earn in excess of $10,800. Although both groups of beneficiaries receive benefit increases once  they stop working in order to compensate for reductions while they were working, there are a number of good reasons  to support repealing the earnings test for beneficiaries who have reached the normal retirement age.         Repealing the retirement earnings test will allow thousands of Social Security recipients to work without a  reduction in their benefits. The Social Security Administration estimates that, in 1999, 793,000 beneficiaries  aged 65 through 69 had some or all of their benefits withheld because of the retirement earnings test.         Repealing the retirement earnings test may create positive work incentives. Because many Social Security beneficiaries  are unaware that the benefit reductions they experience when they are working are offset by benefit increases once  they stop working, they may perceive the retirement earnings test as a tax. In response, they may reduce the number  of hours they work or they may decide to leave the labor force altogether.         The most recent economic research indicates that repealing the retirement earnings test for beneficiaries between  the normal retirement age and age 69 may encourage work. In a 1998 study, Leora Friedberg, an economist at the  University of California, San Diego, found that repealing the retirement earnings test for those beneficiaries  would increase their labor supply by about five percent.         Repealing the retirement earnings test will not affect Social Security's finances over the long run. Repealing  the RET for beneficiaries who have reached the normal retirement age would not change (for better or for worse)  Social Security's currently projected long-range financing shortfall. Repealing the retirement earnings test for  beneficiaries above the normal retirement age has a significant short-run cost ($22.7 billion over the next 10  years), but, over the long run, that cost is offset by lower benefit payments.         Again, under current law, workers who have their benefits reduced due to the retirement earnings test receive  an actuarial adjustment that increases their benefits once they stop working. Repealing the retirement earnings  test would mean that such workers would no longer receive that actuarial adjustment and that benefit payments would  be lower.         Repealing the retirement earnings test will make the Social Security program easier and less expensive to administer.  The Social Security Administration estimates that the cost of administering the earnings test in 1999 ranged from  $100 to $150 million.         Since those costs include administering the earnings test for workers between age 62 and the normal retirement  age, repealing the retirement earnings test for workers above the normal retirement age would save less than that  amount.)         In addition, Social Security Administration estimates that it overpaid $787 million in benefits due to the  retirement earnings test in 1997. Payments to beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 accounted for 63 percent of retirement  earnings test related overpayments in 1998.         If older Americans have the capacity to earn more money without penalty, there will be a greater incentive  for them to work. Working older Americans contribute additional money to the economy and provide more revenue for  the treasury. Furthermore, with advances in medical technology older Americans will remain healthy longer and live  longer productive lives.         I join with my Democratic colleagues and strongly support eliminating the retirement earnings test that penalizes  and discourages workers age 65 through 69 from remaining in the workforce and contributing to our prosperous economy.                [Page: H600]       Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, later today, the House of Representatives will pass H.R. 5, the Senior  Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This Act will eliminate the current tax law which penalizes senior citizens between  65-69 who continue to work. The Senior Citizens Earnings Test taxes senior citizens up to 33 percent of a senior's  Social Security benefits.         One of the most egregious elements of our tax code is the continued over-taxing of American senior citizens  who want to continue working. Repealing this tax on working seniors was the first bill I cosponsored when I was  sworn into office in 1995, and, finally, I think we see light at the end of this tunnel. I would like to thank  Speaker  Hastert  for his leadership on this issue for more than a decade.         This Social Security Earnings Test has two adverse effects: it discourages seniors from working and for those  who do work, it takes away a portion of the Social Security benefits they have earned. With today's labor shortage,  this policy is greatly outdated and needs changing.         The Senior Citizens earnings tax penalty takes $1 of working seniors' Social Security benefits for every $3  they earn over a federal imposed income limit. Seniors earning more than $17,000 are subject to the earnings tax.  In 1999 there were over 4 million working senior citizens, at least 800,000 of them lost some of their Social Security  benefits because of the earnings test. By repealing this tax penalty, the ten year benefit to senior citizens would  be about $23 billion. Seniors can use this extra money for helping with their grandchildren's education, a trip  to visit their family or other loved ones, a car, medical expenses, and prescription drugs.         Republicans have ended 40 years of raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to fund pet projects by tax and spend  politicians. Repealing this seniors' tax builds on that commitment to senior citizens by making sure they get the  benefits they have worked for, even if they choose to continue working. In Florida, over 80,000 seniors could be  able to take advantage of this tax fairness package. This bill ensure that they get the money they have earned  as well as the Social Security benefits they deserve.         A similar bill introduced in 1998 as part of the plan to abolish the Social Security earnings limit only received  support from 19 House Democrats. This year the President has indicated his willingness to sign such a bill, but  he did not include it in his recently submitted FY 2001 budget. The measure enjoys support from such groups as  AARP, United Seniors Association, and the 60 Plus Association. Let's do the right thing and pass this bill.         Mr. WATTS of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, millions of older Americans are penalized every year simply because they  set their alarm clocks to get up early in the morning, get dressed and head off to work. But unlike the rest of  us who pull into rush hour traffic in the morning, that 65 year old in the car next to yours is paying the government  a fee to go to work that day. That fee is called the Social Security Earnings Limitation.         My colleagues, today we can eliminate that fee and undo that injustice. Today we can begin to give America's  senior citizens equal treatment under the nation's tax laws. Today we can guarantee that those senior Americans  who want to continue to work--and can continue to work--today we can guarantee that they won't be penalized for  making that contribution to their families, to their communities and to society in general.         By allowing older Americans the opportunity to stay in the workforce without penalty, we are allowing them  to supplement their incomes, we are helping them to stay healthier, and we are giving them the opportunity to add  to their later retirement. This is especially important as we see more and more Americans living into the eighties,  their nineties and even into their hundreds.         So I encourage my colleagues today to give their older neighbors a fair break. Vote for the Senior Citizens'  Freedom to Work Act.                  Mr. BALLENGER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that another popular tax relief proposal, the Senior Citizens' Freedom  to Work Act, is coming up for a vote today. First, let me point out that the debate over H.R. 5 should contain  no rhetoric that this repeal of the Social Security earnings limit will break the bank. The Social Security actuaries  have confirmed that repeal of the earnings limit maintains the current projected solvency of the Social Security  Trust Fund.         The repeal of the Social Security earnings limit for individuals who have attained the full retirement age  has been a very high priority of mine and for my Republican colleagues elected to the House in 1986. Although we  were able a few years ago to secure a gradual increase in the earnings limit for seniors who were 65 to 69 years  old, the complete repeal of the earnings limit for this group is a big victory. I am pleased that so many senior  citizens' groups have joined us in this fight, and I welcome President Clinton's announced support for this repeal  as well.         The Social Security earnings limit is a relic of the Great Depression when it was necessary to entice older  workers to leave the work force, making more jobs available to younger workers. Today, many businesses and communities  face a serious worker shortage. My congressional district has an especially low rate of unemployment now: a meager  1.6 percent. This means that opportunities for older workers abound, providing earning potential and related benefits  to the seniors willing and physically able to meet the challenge. Further, I am pleased that H.R. 5 provides immediate  relief by covering income earned after December 31, 1999.         For those in the 10th Congressional District and elsewhere who do not know me well, I am proud to report that  I am a working senior. Too old now to benefit from this change in the tax code, I nevertheless enjoy a higher quality  of life--and perhaps better health--which comes with being more active. In addition, I feel that my many years  of experience add to my job performance as a long work history does for so many seniors.         Again, let me say that I appreciate the support of our colleagues in getting this repeal bill before the House  today. Our Nation's seniors deserve this extra incentive to remain productive in their later years and our work  force needs them.         Mr. BUYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. I have  long supported repeal of this onerous, burdensome rule on this nation's working seniors.         The earnings limit penalty requires seniors age 65 to 69 who earn over $17,000 to forfeit 33% of their Social  Security benefits. Seniors with golden parachutes or extensive investments do not face such a penalty . . . only  those who get up every morning, head off to work, and make valuable contributions to our labor force. This is unfair.         As a relic of the Great Depression, Congress is overdue to reform this antiquated law. The earnings limit is  a great disincentive to seniors to remain in the workforce if they so choose. In reality, it is the imposition  of a high marginal tax rate on productive seniors in the workforce, who are also paying federal and state income  taxes, and Social Security payroll taxes.         I'm pleased to see this legislation come to the floor in a bipartisan fashion. I'm pleased the President has  indicated he will sign it. I look forward to lifting this burden from working seniors.         Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering very important legislation which will eliminate one of  the most unfair tax burdens even placed on Americans and give our senior citizens the freedom to work.         The high tax rate on the earnings of older Americans has created a significant roadblock at a time when workforce  participation by these individuals is extremely important to the continuing growth of the U.S. economy. Economists  and Federal Reserve Board officials, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, have expressed concern that the shrinking  pool of available workers cannot satisfy the surging quantity of goods and services demanded by the American people  and people around the world.         I have heard a number of stories, some during a hearing I held as Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee for  the Education & Workforce Committee, and others more recently during town hall meetings I held last week in  West Michigan. In each case the message was the same: the current system discourages older Americans from re-entering  or continuing in the workforce. We need to keep these individuals in the workforce and the repeal of the earnings  limit will be an essential step in encouraging their participation.         Mr. Speaker, I should also note that as seniors and others enter the workforce, there is one thing they do  not know--the true costs of Social Security and Medicare. Currently, an employee's W-2 lists his or hers withholdings  for Social Security and Medicare. What the employees don't know, is how much their employer also pays for these  programs. This is another unfairness we need to correct by passing the Right To Know National Payroll Act, which  would require the employers share of Social Security and Medicare taxes to be disclosed on each employee's annual  W-2. American workers have a right to know the true costs of Social Security and Medicare.                [Page: H601]       Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, today, we are witnessing the best of Congress as Members of different ideologies  and political parties come together for the benefit of the American people.         Today, the House of Representatives will pass the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act (H.R. 5) which will repeal  the Depression-era earnings limit imposed on Social Security recipients between the ages of 65 and 69 who decide  to supplement their retirement income by working. Under current law, seniors who work lose $1 of their Social Security  benefits for every $3 they earn outside earned income beyond $17,000 a year.         In the real world, this outdated law has adversely affected several thousand of my constituents in Queens and  the Bronx. A number of seniors in my district have gotten part-time jobs to supplement their income so as to improve  their quality of life, offset some of their expenses such as the high costs of their prescription drugs and remain  active.         Unfortunately, once many of these seniors recognize how much they are losing in their Social Security benefits  by working, they quit their jobs.         I believe it is both foolish and counterproductive to punish working people.         This legislation will assist people like Mr. Christopher Christie, a constituent of mine from the Bronx, New  York. He was punished by the earning limit. After he retired, he spent several weeks working in a small business  she operated and as a doorman on Park Avenue. He saw his Social Security check garnished monthly because of his  outside jobs.         Therefore, I am pleased that the House is debating this legislation to repeal the earnings limit and allow  our seniors the freedom to work and attain some financial independence.         This bill represents a solid first step in improving the quality of life of America's seniors. I hope that  Congress will now address the other issues of importance to seniors, such as the inclusion of prescription drug  coverage under Medicare.         Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the bill H.R. 5, The Senior Citizens Freedom to Work act.         Under current law, seniors who claim Social Security benefits before they reach 69 are subject to a reduction  in benefits if they continue to work. For seniors 65 to 69, benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 that their  earnings exceed the limit, which was $17,000 in 2000, and which rises to $30,000 in 2002 and is indexed after that.  This bill would repeal these limits entirely, effective immediately.         The earnings limit originated in the 1930's and has remained in effect because Congress never changed it, despite  the vast changes in the economy and the lives of senior citizens that have taken place in the last 60 years.         Nearly 50,000 senior citizens in Texas are currently being penalized for working, a prospect that does not  bode well for the economic circumstances for those in the twilight of their lives. We should not punish senior  citizens for participating in the workforce; we should reward that. People remain healthy and vigorous much longer  than they did in the 1930's.         It makes sense to repeal this obsolete and punitive limit. I have supported raising the limit in past years  and support repealing it now. Today's legislation is important to consider as part of a broader plan to use the  surplus to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt.         Today, we can take the first step towards strengthening retirement security for all seniors. But this step  was just the very beginning of what we must do in order to put Social Security on a firm financial footing well  into the 21st century. I hope the House of Representatives, which showed such passion today when talking about  removing the earnings limit will show the same kind of passion over the next few months as we debate the proper  use of the surplus. We must use the budget surplus to strengthen Social Security and Medicare.                  Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong and stringent support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom  to Work Act. Current law limits the income of retirees ages 65 to 69 to $17,000. Social Security benefits are reduced  one dollar for every three dollars earned above $17,000. Social Security Administration statistics show that nearly  `690,000 beneficiaries between 65 and 69 lose some or all of their benefits because of excess earnings resulting  from their work.' This bill, which repeals the earnings limits imposed under Social Security on our nation's working  senior citizens, is a welcomed measure which will allow our seniors to continue to contribute to our growing economy.         The earnings limit is an outdated relic of the depression era social security program. It was instituted based  on a policy that addressed a problem of that time; however, times have changed. Then, our nation was worried about  moving seniors out of the work force to make room for the growing number of younger workers. Now, labor statistics  indicate that as our nation's population ages, there will be a shortage of workers available to meet our future  labor needs. H.R. 5 is needed to provide incentive to seniors to help supplement the nation's future need for workers.         Past Social Security policy overlooked the valuable assets that senior citizens bring to our nation's workforce.  Seniors have a wealth of wisdom and experience to offer the workforce. Most enjoy bestowing the benefit of their  experience and wisdom on younger workers and generally offer their knowledge for reasons other than the sheer pursuit  of wealth. Seniors tend to exemplify the attributes of hard-work, punctuality and patience. In this time of instant  gratification, I can think of no better teachers of the value of a work ethic which developed over time can be  passed on to future generations. Seniors have much to offer and this bill will make it easier for the workforce  to receive the benefit of their wisdom and experience.         Seniors have worked long and hard to earn and they should not be deprived of the fruits of their labor. Today,  seniors are living longer and healthier lives and they are more fit and willing than ever to contribute to our  nation's workforce. Many view working as a necessary part of their well-being and quality of life. As a society  we should not handicap the lifestyle of those who choose to work into their silver years. H.R. 5 reconciles past  policy that punished seniors by forcing them to sit on the sidelines of the workforce.         There are also many seniors who have no choice but to work. Skyrocketing, pharmaceutical prices have left seniors  struggling to meet the financial burden of much needed medicine. Every year we listen to the stories of seniors  who die in their home due to their inability to meet the heating or air-conditioning costs. How can we continue  to penalize them for their necessary efforts to meet those costs?         Unfortunately, many of the seniors who need to work most are our nation's women, who outlive their male spouse  75% of the time. Indeed, `103,000 dependent and spousal beneficiaries are affected by the limit.' Widowed women  often are forced to reenter the work force in order to meet their basic needs. They should not be forced to lose  some or all of their retirement benefits, while striving to secure the simple necessities of living.         While I support and applaud this effort on behalf of our nation's seniors, I would be remiss not to mention  the continued problem facing Social Security. Ensuring the future solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund is  a problem this Congress still must address. It is my hope that H.R. 5, is simply a stepping stone along the path  of addressing a problem that is not going to go away. I urge the leadership of this House to bring forth legislation  that seeks to make the tough decisions necessary to address the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund before  we are faced with even tougher more painful decisions.                  Mr. COX. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hastert ),  for his long commitment to repealing the punitive tax on seniors. One of the first bills I sponsored way back in  1989, during my first year in Congress, was  Denny Hastert 's `Older Americans' Freedom to Work  Act.' I'm delighted that we are finally moving forward with this historic legislation. It is long overdue.         I recently pointed out, while arguing for repeal of the marriage penalty tax, that in America you should not  be discriminated against by our tax code solely because of your status. We have civil rights laws in America to  make sure that each of us is protected against unfair treatment by our government. Yet, just as the marriage penalty  discriminates against people who are married, the earnings test discriminates against people over 65 who choose  to stay productive.         This costly and regressive tax forces many seniors from the job market. Whereas 50 years ago 47% of men over  65 were employed in the labor force, today it is only 16.5%.         A senior who chooses to work after the retirement age of 65 faces a tax burden that amounts to government confiscation.  A senior who chooses to work loses $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 in wages and salaries he or she  earns over $17,000. Yet $17,000 is close to the official U.S. government poverty level for working families. When  one adds the burdens of income and payroll taxes, this amounts to a marginal tax rate on working seniors as high  as 80%--higher than the rate for billionaires.         The government should not penalize working seniors by canceling their Social Security benefits. These benefits  are not welfare; they have been earned over a lifetime of hard work.         Repeal of the earnings test is also another important step toward ensuring that Social Security is always there  for seniors. I am hopeful we can bring the same bipartisan support we have today to the upcoming debate on supplementing  Social Security benefits through personal retirement accounts.         The Clinton-Gore administration has had eight years to repeal this discriminatory burden on seniors. The Democratic  Congress has 40 years to do it. Not only did they fail to do so, they raised taxes on working seniors. The 1993  Clinton tax increase included a 70% increase in income taxes on Social Security benefits, for seniors earning as  little as $34,000.         In 1996, for the first time ever, the new Republican majority in Congress provided relief to seniors by reducing  the Social Security earnings penalty. The new law more than doubled the amount a senior citizen could earn without  losing his or her Social Security benefits, from $11,280 to $30,000 in 2002. This change has already had a positive  effect: the number of senior citizens choosing to remain in the labor force has increased by 7%. Today's long-overdue  step--passage of H.R. 5 to completely repeal the unfair earnings test--finally finishes the job Congress started  in 1996, and that Speaker  Hastert  started more than a decade ago.                [Page: H602]       Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with members of Congress who have introduced bills  that advocate comprehensive reform of Social Security. We understand the immensity of the challenge facing the  country as baby boomers retire, how demographics result in a huge responsibility for future generations, and the  importance of preparing Social Security for the future. You will find repeal in the Social Security Solvency Act  for 2000, which I introduced in November. Bills that I introduced this year and last year, including the Social  Security Solvency Act for 2000, included elimination of the earnings limit, plus another provision that I consider  to be the counterbalance to the earnings test--accelerating the increase in the `delayed retirement credit' or  DRC.         If a worker decides to continue working after 65 and defer his monthly benefit, the DRC increases the size  of his monthly check he will ultimately receive from Social Security. A worker who turns 65 this year will see  his benefits increase 6 percent for every year he defers his benefit. Current law allows a worker to delay retirement  for up to five years, working until he reaches 70. If that retiree's monthly benefit was $1,000 when he turned  65, it will be $1,300 if he puts off receiving a Social Security check until he's 70--that's an extra $3,600 a  year. However, if that worker enjoys an average length of retirement, this delay puts him at a disadvantage. He  should be receiving an extra $4,800 a year, not $3,600.         Under current law, the DRC is set to rise to 8 percent in 2008. This is the amount that Social Security considers  to be `actuarially sound.' That means that a retiree who delays receiving his benefit is getting proper compensation  in the future for the money he does not get today. As we eliminate the earnings limit, it is reasonable to include  an increase in the DRC. Retirees deserve a fair deal today--not in 2008. Now that we are taking away the earnings  limit that discourages senior citizens from working, we should accelerate the DRC and encourage them to `save'  so they have a higher benefit during the years they no longer have outside earnings. The accelerated DRC will encourage  people to work as long as they choose. The Social Security actuaries have examined my proposal to accelerate the  DRC, and they say it is actuarially sound. It doesn't cost taxpayers or weaken the Social Security trust fund.         There are three reasons to accelerate the DRC:         1. Fairness--Give workers who choose to delay receiving their Social Security benefit an increase that is consistent  with actuarial assumptions.         2. Choice--Give senior citizens more options to manage their retirement--they choose when they retire and when  they should apply for benefits.         3. To Fight Poverty--Give a higher survivor benefit to widows whose spouses took benefits based on the DRC.         When I learned of the Ways and Means markup of H.R. 5, I approached Representative  Shaw  and  Representative  Archer , and presented my amendment to accelerate the DRC. After careful consideration  by the Social Security subcommittee, I received agreement to add this amendment. Gene Sperling called me on the  evening of Feb. 28 to tell me that the President had agreed to support it, and the minority gave their consent  on Tuesday.         This amendment is to too important to be stalled by politics. I will continue to fight for its inclusion, and  I remain optimistic that I will see the DRC acceleration language in the bill that President Clinton finally signs  into law.         Ms. D eLAURO.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of bringing relief to thousands of seniors who  are unfairly punished by the Social Security earnings penalty. For too many seniors, working after they turn 65  isn't an option--it is a necessity. They can ill afford a smaller Social Security check each month. We should fix  this inequity and do what is fair and right for our seniors. They deserve nothing less.         Last week, I met with a group of working seniors in West Haven, Connecticut. One was Mary Grabowski. Mary recently  retired, but she quickly realized she had to continue to work after she turned 65 because she simply couldn't afford  not to. It wasn't a choice. It wasn't so she could make a little extra money on the side. It was about being able  to pay her bills.         I also listened to the story of Estelle Stuart. Estelle is also a recent retiree who came to realize that Social  Security simply isn't going to be enough for her to get by. In particular, Estelle is forced to work in order to  pay for the prescription drugs she desperate needs.         Mary Grabowski, Estelle Stuart, and the thousands of other seniors like them who must continue to work after  65, are perfect examples of why the earnings penalty is wrong and why we need to end it. I want to thank both of  them for sharing their story with me.         Ending the earnings penalty today is a good start. It's important to thousands of seniors. But tomorrow, let's  get to work and pass a responsible plan that will strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and provide our seniors  with a prescription drug benefit. It is a plan that honors our seniors and protects our values. We've taken a positive  first step today. Let's get to work and finish the job.                  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, the second session of the 106th Congress has been off to a quick start passing  landmark legislation that directly impacts millions of Americans and improves our quality of life.         First, we repealed the Marriage Penalty Tax, and today, we will ensure that older men and women still in the  workforce will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money without losing important Social Security benefits.         Mr. Speaker, as you are well aware, the golden years for many older men and women in America involve all types  of activities. More and more, older Americans are sharing their lifelong experience in business and industry with  a new generation of Americans in the workplace. Benefiting from tremendous advances in health care and increasing  life expectancy rates, our older people--the generation of men and women who carried our nation through World War  II, and beyond--continue to contribute to the economic well being of our state and nation.         While some older men and women are working because they need the paycheck to put food on the table, others  keep working simply because they like what they do and see no reason to stop doing it just because they have reached  their sixty-fifth birthday.         Right now, the tax code penalizes older Americans who choose to keep working. Over 800,000 seniors today lose  part or all of their Social Security benefits because of the Social Security `earnings limit.' Almost 37,000 older  men and women in New Jersey alone are hit by this unfair penalty.         The present limit cuts or entirely eliminates Social Security benefits for working older men and women whose  yearly incomes exceed a certain amount. In 2000, working Americans between the ages of 65-69 will lose $1 in Social  Security benefits for every $3 in earnings over the limit.         The Social Security earnings limit was created during the Great Depression when jobs were scarce. It was designed  to encourage older workers to leave the workforce to free up jobs for younger workers. What may have been good  policy during the worst economic downturn in American history is bad policy today during one of the best economic  cycles with more challenges and opportunities for everyone.         Our economy is booming and unemployment is at a record low. These working older men and women are an important  part of that success. They should be encouraged to remain a vital part of the work force rather than be penalized  for their labors. In addition, people today are living longer and healthier lives. Soon, millions of baby boomers  will reach retirement age. If these people wish to remain productive members of the workforce long past their sixty-fifth  birthday, their experiences, industry, and productiveness should be rewarded.         The Social Security earnings limit penalty is wrong, unfair, and should be scrapped. With the President in  agreement, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in full support, let's pass `The Senior Citizens Freedom  to Work Act' (H.R. 5), after so many years of inaction.       [Page: H603]   Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.  LaTourette ). All time for debate having expired, pursuant to the order of the House of today, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended.

Mr. President, it has been agreed that I will begin these brief remarks in order that our chairman    might conclude the debate and proceed to the vote which I think has every prospect of being prodigious in its majority.      We have heard the compelling arguments to eliminate the so-called earnings penalty for persons 65 years and    older. There is a short-term cost that is followed by a long-term payback, if you like, such that in a 20- to 30-year    period the Social Security trust funds will not in any way be affected. The present practice is to decrease benefits    to persons who continue working after their technical retirement age is reached, and then to compensate them after    they reach age 70 or stop working. It is a complicated calculation. It is a cause of much distress, if you like,    within the Social Security Administration--about $100 million a year just in sorting out the claims. It is not    understood. There is the elemental fact that, although at 65 if you continue to work you know you will get back    your benefits, that is in actuarial terms. For the cohort of several million persons, it will all be evened out.    You may not be. So why not get rid of this archaic complexity? It is a remnant of Depression legislation of the    1930s.      In that regard, however, we do have the question attending the long-term deficit of the Social Security system.    Yesterday our friend from Arizona, Senator  McCain , spoke eloquently about that matter, having    raised it during his primary campaign on his side of the aisle. Senator  Kerrey  spoke with equal    eloquence. Senator  McCain  was kind enough to note legislation that Senator  Kerrey     and I have introduced in this matter.      In very short order, I would simply like to recapitulate the four simple steps which put Social Security on    an actuarially sound basis for the next 75 years. They are:      No. 1, provide for an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. In 1996, the Boskin Commission originally estimated    that the CPI overstates changes in the cost-of-living by 1.1 percentage points; now they say it is 0.8 of a percentage    point.      No. 2, normal taxation of benefits.      No. 3, extend coverage to all newly hired State and local workers.      I might interject, if ever there was a holdover from the 1930s, it was this. It was not clear at that time whether    the Federal Government could tax a State entity, so they were left untaxed. A great many workers in civil service    positions pay no taxes on their principal jobs, but qualify for benefits from `side' jobs, and it is just not fair.    We are not taking away anything, but just covering newly hired workers like everyone else.      No. 4, increase the length of the computation period from 35 to 38 years.      We now have a 75-year, long-term actuarial deficit of 2.07 percent. This would bring that down by 2.05 percent,    leaving an inconsequential .02 percent over the 75-year period.      These are data based on actuarial calculations and they are clearly within our capacity. Let us hope one day    we do it before it becomes too late. That time will come sooner than you may think.      Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the table be printed in the  Record  at the conclusion    of my remarks.      There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  Record,  as follows:           ELIMINATING SOCIAL SECURITY'S LONG-TERM DEFICIT           Numbers expressed as a percent of payroll 1      [Numbers expressed as a percent of payroll] 1      LONG-TERM (75 YEAR) ACTUARIAL DEFICIT      2.07      Reduction in deficit due to:      0.8 percentage point cost of living correction      -1.16      Normal taxation of benefits      2 -0.43      Extend coverage to all newly hired State and local workers      3 -0.21      Increase length of computation period from 35 to 38 years      -0.25      Total reduction in deficit      -2.05      1 Estimates are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 1999 Trustees Report and ignore interactions among    the provisions.      2 Social Security benefits would be treated like income from a private pension so that benefits that are attributed    to employer contributions and interest earnings would be subject taxed, while benefits attributed to employee contributions    would not be taxed. Currently, benefits are taxed only if income exceeds certain thresholds and, depending on some    complex formula, only up to 50 or up to 85 percent of the benefit is subject to taxation.      3 This is the rule that applied to newly hired Federal workers in 1984 and thereafter.           [Page: S1534]      Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I look forward to the statement of our revered chairman, who is going to have a    historic triumph this morning.      The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.      Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first let me thank and congratulate my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator    from New York, for his leadership throughout the years on this most important domestic program, Social Security.    There is no program of greater importance and interest to the American people than Social Security. The distinguished    Senator, Mr.  Moynihan , as I said, throughout his career has played a critical role in the development,    the preserving, and the strengthening of this important program. I thank him and congratulate him.      As Senator  Moynihan  pointed out, the Senate is now turning to the vote to repeal the Social    Security earnings limit, an important step in preparing Social Security for the 21st century. This repeal is good    for seniors, it is good for America, and it is good government. As we have heard, the Social Security earnings    limit was enacted 65 years ago to encourage older persons to retire during the Great Depression. But today, with    Americans living longer, and the tightest labor market in 30 years, this rule is not only outdated, but it harms    both our senior citizens and the economy.      Repealing the earnings limit will help improve the retirement security of seniors by giving them the choice    to work longer and to save more. Abolishing the earnings limit will allow us to protect the Nation's economic gains    of the past 17 years by encouraging our Nation's most experienced workers to continue working, not only for today    but into the future.      Finally, repealing the earnings limit is just plain good government. It will save the Social Security Administration    money and reduce very common, frustrating mistakes in calculating benefits. So let me say, I urge each Senator    to support this bill.      I am happy to yield the remaining time to the distinguished assistant leader of the majority.      The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.      Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?      The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 1/2 minutes.      Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, Senator  Roth  and Senator  Moynihan     because they work so well together.      Today, we are going to pass something that will have a positive impact on millions of Americans. I say millions--some    people say there are only 800,000 people who are currently paying the Social Security earnings penalty. There are    millions of people who want to work, maybe have to work, but basically their taxes are so punitive that they cannot    work; it does not make sense to work. Their taxes are so high they have to work more for government than they work    for themselves.      These are senior citizens, not particularly wealthy people. You can be a senior citizen and have, as an individual,    an earned income of $30,000. You are in the 28-percent tax bracket. Because of the earnings penalty on Social Security,    that is an additional 33-percent tax bracket. Add those two together and you are at 61 percent. You have to pay    Social Security tax. If you are self-employed, you add 15 percent to that. That is 76 percent, and you have not    even paid taxes to the State.      For most States, that is 6 or 7 percent.      You can have a marginal tax rate of 80 percent; you work four times more for the Government than you do for    yourself. That is way too high. This 33-percent penalty for seniors between the ages of 65 and 70 who want to have    earned income--maybe need to have earned income--is long past overdue for repeal.      I am delighted that today we are going to fulfill what the House has done. I compliment Chairman  Archer     in the House. I compliment Chairman  Roth  and Senator  Moynihan . I remember Senator     McCain  speaking on this issue for years. I remember Senator  Ashcroft  making tireless    speeches, saying we need to repeal the earnings penalty.      Over the years, we have raised the amount people can save before the penalty takes effect, but the penalty still    takes effect for any income above $17,000. The real solution is to repeal it. That is what we are going to do today.    We are going to open up economic opportunity for millions of Americans who are at age 65 and maybe do not want    to retire. They might be a  Strom Thurmond ; they who may have another 50 years of very energetic    hard work ahead of them and they don't want to say they want to retire. We should not force them to retire.      The earnings penalty forces many of these people to retire--some of our most productive citizens in America.    I think it is wrong. This tax penalty is wrong. We are going to repeal it today. We are repealing it with bipartisan    support. It is going to become the law of the land.      Again, I compliment our leader for proving we can get some good things done that will have a positive impact    on millions--frankly, on all of us, because a lot of us want to work beyond the age of 65. Now we are telling seniors    they can do so.      Again, my congratulations to the leaders for making this happen. I think this will make Social Security policy    better and, frankly, it will make economic policy better for all Americans.      Mr. President, I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill.      Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. The passage    of this legislation is long overdue. The Social Security earnings test is bad for our economy and bad for individual    senior Americans who wish to continue in the workforce. I am extremely pleased that the Senate is moving to eliminate    the earnings test.      I am hopeful, however, that passage of this bill will not mark the end of thoughtful policy regarding the role    of seniors in the American workforce. Senior workers are an invaluable resource for our nation. As the number of    Americans of retirement age increases, the economy's need for senior workers will inevitably increase as well.    We should encourage those seniors who wish to continue working by making certain that they are treated fairly by    tax and retirement laws.      Too often, government policy toward retirees has assumed that all seniors have the same needs, goals, and desires.    Mr. President, each individual is different. Many seniors look forward to a leisurely retirement that allows them    to pursue activities for which they did not have time when they were working. American seniors have earned this    option, and trends over the last several decades that demonstrate the average senior is enjoying a healthier and    more prosperous retirement are extremely encouraging.      But other senior Americans wish to delay retirement for as long as possible. Many seniors who have communicated    with me about this subject simply enjoy the stimulation that a workplace provides on a daily basis. Others are    not ready to leave businesses or farms that they have spent their entire lives building. Still others wish to continue    to contribute to the income of their families, children, or grandchildren. Regardless of their reasons for wanting    to stay in the workplace, no senior should find that government policy is a disincentive or barrier to work.      In addition to ensuring basic fairness to individuals, providing further incentives to senior workers makes    good sense for our economy. Seniors who stay in the workforce continue to pay taxes on their earnings and continue    to provide much-needed experience to the American economy. As our economy grows and the baby-boom generation approaches    retirement age, we may experience more frequent labor shortages. Ultimately, a declining number of qualified workers    could be detrimental to the economy. Adding incentives that reward older Americans for staying in the workforce    could help alleviate such shortages while continuing to improve our economy and standard of living.      Last month, with the support of Senators  Breaux  and  Gregg , I introduced two    pieces of legislation that would encourage American seniors to stay in the workforce.      These bills, entitled the Retired Americans Right of Employment Acts (RARE I and RARE II), are based on the    premise that many seniors want to work and their labor is invaluable to our economy and society. Both bills would    repeal the earnings test, as we are seeking to do today. But they would go further by implementing specific tax    and benefit changes that would reward seniors who choose to work.      Among other provisions, both bills would phase in a formula allowing income earned after the retirement age    to be counted in the calculation of an individual's Social Security benefits. Currently, Social Security benefits    for most people are based on the average of the top 35 earning years prior to age 62. Allowing income earned after    age 62 to be included in benefit calculations would increase the benefits of those seniors who choose to continue    working.      The two bills offer alternative methods to reduce the taxes of working seniors. RARE I would cut the FICA tax    of seniors by 10 percent when they reach full retirement age. As a result, retirees would see their FICA tax reduced    from 7.65 percent of their paycheck to 6.885 percent. Because taxes are levied on the first dollar of wages earned,    this tax reduction would benefit all income levels of retirees, including those who choose to work part-time.      RARE II would provide individuals who have reached the full retirement age with a tax credit equal to 10 percent    of the lesser of the amount of income tax owed or the earned income of the individual. This provision would effectively    reward older Americans who continue to earn and to pay taxes after reaching retirement age.      Mr. President, in closing, I want to reiterate my strong support for the underlying bill being discussed today.    The elimination of the Social Security earnings test would be a huge step toward ending the disincentives for seniors    to work if they choose. But I hope this is only a first step in adjusting policy governing seniors in the workplace.    Other changes contained in the RARE bills, which I have described, as well as the repeal of the Clinton Administration's    1993 tax on Social Security benefits, would reaffirm the importance of seniors in our society. The health of our    economy and even our national strength will increasingly depend on retaining the services of productive seniors.    We should begin constructing these policies now.      Thank you, Mr. President.           [Page: S1535]      Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the time is right to repeal the Social Security earnings test. I ask my colleagues    to join with me today in support of the passage of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 1999.      We all know that reaching retirement age does not necessarily mean a person is ready to retire. It is good news    that Americans are now living longer and healthier lives, and I believe that the Social Security system should    not penalize those who want to work longer. I understand that many older workers choose to remain in the workforce    because they need additional income or have no desire to stop working. I fully support this choice, and I believe    that no one should face financial penalties for that personal decision.      In South Dakota this year, 2000 people have seen their Social Security benefits reduced because they chose to    continue working when they reached the age of 65. All told, Social Security withheld about $8 million in Social    Security payments last year from those South Dakotans. That works out to a loss of about $4000 in Social Security    benefits for each of those 2000 South Dakotans. That is not right. Let's not penalize them for staying in the work    force to achieve a better standard of living. I know many Americans over 65 in my state who could use that money    to pay for health insurance, prescription drugs, and electric bills.      H.R. 5 will not only help these 2000 workers who are not receiving their Social Security benefits, but also    encourage those who want to work, but are not doing so now because they fear the earnings limit would consume most    or all of their earned benefits. As baby boomers begin to retire, it is especially important that these older Americans    who want to work be encouraged to do so. Our nation is celebrating record low unemployment. Let us seize this opportunity    to recognize the skills, knowledge, and experience that people over 65 have to offer. I am pleased that Congress    is on the verge of removing the earnings limit to encourage citizens in my state and across the country to continue    making an important contribution to the American economy.      Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to build on the momentum created by this bipartisan bill to work toward    Social Security reform. We can pass legislation this year that will extend the solvency of Social Security for    50 years by using the interest savings earned by paying down the debt. We should take that simple step this year    on a bipartisan basis, just as we are passing this bill today.      Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support HR 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This very    important legislation would help millions of American seniors who choose to, or must work after retirement.      Under current law, the Social Security benefits of those seniors ages 65 though 69 who continue to work will    be reduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings over $17,000. In other words, they will be taxed at 33.3 percent of their    earnings above the threshold.      However, the onerous tax burden on our seniors does not stop there. These seniors are also subject to a 15.3    percent payroll tax, and a 15 percent income tax. Combined with the earnings test, these seniors are paying taxes    of over 60 percent on their earnings from working. If their earnings bump up their income, their Social Security    benefits are then taxed. The tax bite could take 68 to 91 percent of their additional earnings.      Mr. President, this is absurd. We must correct this unfair tax burden on our seniors.      When Social Security was set up 65 years ago during the Great Depression, jobs were scarce, workers were younger    and many could not find work to support their families. One of the intentions of the Social Security program was    to encourage older workers to retire, so that younger workers could find a job.      Today, our situation is dramatically different. The economic and demographic conditions in the U.S. are not    what they were when Social Security was established. Our strong economy has created a tight labor market. After    filling over 20 million new jobs during this economic expansion, we still have a job shortage, particularly skilled    workers. It is projected that this shortage will continue for the next 5 to 10 years.      Lower birth rates and a longer life expectancy mean that the number and relative size of the older population    is growing rapidly. The number of Americans over age 65 has grown from 8 percent in 1950 to 14 percent in 1990    and is projected to reach 22 percent in 2030.      This demographic change has triggered a serious Social Security crisis. In 1940 there were 100 workers to support    1 retiree. Today that ratio has dropped to 3 workers supporting 1 retiree. In less than 20 years, that ratio will    decrease to 2 to 1. As a result, we have a $20 trillion unfunded Social Security liability.      The earnings test penalty has worsened this situation. It discourages seniors from working, even though their    skills are much needed in the labor market. If allowed to work without penalty, they will continue to pay payroll    taxes into the Social Security system which will help us work toward solvency of the system.      Another important reason we must get rid of the earnings test is that Social Security is a very poor investment    for Americans. Americans pay a significant amount of payroll taxes through their working life but face low and    declining returns from Social Security, and some receive less in benefits than they have paid in payroll taxes.    Their Social Security benefits cannot even begin to meet their pre-retirement standard of living. Many seniors    have no choice but to continue to work--and others want to work for the joy of it.      Over the past 15 years, goods purchased mainly by seniors increased 6 percentage points more than goods purchased    by the general public. Their medical costs skyrocketed 156 percent.      As inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods continues to rise, older Americans' hard-earned Social Security    benefits are worth less and less. Their purchasing power will continue to diminish.      I believe the earnings test on Social Security benefits is wrong and unfair because Social Security benefits    are earned benefits for many senior citizens. The Social Security benefits which working seniors are losing due    to the earnings test penalty are benefits they have rightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout    their working years before retiring.      These are benefits they should not be losing just because they are trying to survive by supplementing their    Social Security income. Reducing Social Security benefits upon additional earnings is just double taxation.      As health care and other costs continue to grow, the incomes of more and more senior citizens are falling along    with their standard of living. This earnings test hurts seniors who choose, or must work after retirement to maintain    their standard of living or to pay for costly health insurance premiums, medical care, prescriptions and many other    expenses which increase in retirement years. This is particularly true for seniors with lower-incomes who must    work and depend on their earned income for survival.      Mr. President, we cannot let this practice continue.      Eliminating the earnings test on Social Security benefits would reverse this trend, and help responsible senior    citizens. The federal government has entered into a sacred covenant with the American people to provide retirement    benefits once contribution commitments are made. It is the government's contractual duty to honor that commitment.    The government cannot and should not take money from seniors that is rightfully theirs.      Mr. President, I'd like to briefly discuss the health of our Social Security system. Social Security benefits    will exceed payroll taxes by 2014 or soon.      President Clinton claims he is saving Social Security by using the interest savings that will result from paying    down the government debt held by the public. However, his proposal does not push back the date that Social Security    will run a deficit by a single year, and the transfer from the general fund to Social Security does not cover a    fraction of the shortfall.      Mr. President, without reform, the unfunded liability of Social Security will crowd out all of our discretionary    spending. It will create financial hardship for millions of baby boomers and impose a heavy burden on future generations.    We must address this vitally important issue as quickly as we can.      I believe the best way to fix Social Security is to move it from the current pay-as-you-go system to a fully    funded one, and the immediate step we should take is to lock in every penny of the Social Security surplus safe    from government spending, and put it toward Americans' retirement. My lockbox would sequester spending if re-estimates    result in spending any of our Social Security surplus.      In addition, we need to tell Americans the whole truth about Social Security since payroll taxes are the largest    tax that many families will ever pay, accounting for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime income they will make.      That's why I also support the Gregg amendment which would require the government to provide information on the    financial status of the program. This amendment is along the same line of my legislation, S. 1104, the Social Security    Information Act. Reliable information on Social Security is crucial to enable Americans to better understand the    value of their Social Security investment and to help them determine exactly how much they should supplement their    expected Social Security benefits with other savings in order to have a certain level of retirement security.      Mr. President, let me close by saying it is critical that we repeal the earnings test penalty. We owe our seniors    nothing less than to remove this senseless provision and give them the opportunity to sustain and hopefully improve    their standard of living by allowing them to work without additional tax penalties. It is equally important that,    by continuing to pay into the Social Security system, our seniors will actually give us more time to reform it--which    ultimately benefits everyone.           [Page: S1536]      Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is taking action on the H.R. 5, the Senior Citizen's Freedom    to Work Act of 2000. This legislation eliminates the earnings test for Social Security recipients between the full    retirement age (currently 65) and age 69. The measure will be retroactive to January 1, 2000.      I have long supported changing the Social Security earnings test, which the amount of income recipients may    earn before their benefits are reduced. Under current law, recipients aged 65 through 69 can earn up to $17,000    per year without penalty. But beyond that, benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings. This year, approximately    800,000 seniors will lose benefits. Repealing the earnings test will allow older Americans who have skills and    expertise to continue working and making a contribution to society and to our economy.      I am concerned about the Social Security earnings test and realize the difficulties that many older Americans    experience because of it. For many seniors, working beyond the age of 65 is necessary just to make ends meet. Changing    the earnings limit will allow them to earn extra income without losing hard-earned Social Security benefits. They    have spent a lifetime working for these benefits and they should get them, whether they choose to continue to work    or not.      I have supported past legislation to raise the earnings test limit. Today, I fully support this legislation    to eliminate the earnings test for all individuals who have reached full retirement age.      This bill is especially important to North Dakota because we have one of the highest rates of seniors receiving    Social Security benefits.      I am also pleased because this bill is fiscally responsible. In the long term, it will not have any financial    impact on our Social Security trust fund.      I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.           [Page: S1537]      Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today is a particularly important day for American seniors. With a unanimous vote,    the Senate passed H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom To Work Act which will abolish a Depression-era Social Security    restriction that lowers benefits paid to seniors ages 65 to 69 who earn more than a specified amount each year.    Earlier this month the House passed H.R. 5 by a vote of 422 to 0. As a proud cosponsor of the Senate version of    this bill, I am elated that Congress moved swiftly to pass this long overdue legislation.      Presently, the Social Security earnings test reduces benefits $1 for every $3 over earnings of $17,000 for retirees    age 65 to 69. Due to the cap on earnings, older Americans, many of whom live on fixed, modest-incomes, are burdened    with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When this is combined with Federal, State, local and other Social    Security taxes, it amounts to an atrocious 55-65 percent tax or even higher. Such a policy defies the principals    of self-reliance and personal responsibility on which America was founded. Seniors who have substantial outside    income from investments have never had a similar tax penalty to pay.      By eliminating the retirement earnings test, older Americans can now decide whether and how much they want to    work without a reduction in their current Social Security benefits.      An estimated 800,000 Americans lost all or part of their Social Security benefits in 1999 because they were    employed and earned more than the limit. Even a part-time job can put someone over the earnings limit. According    to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the elimination of the earnings test will affect approximately 1,153,000 retirees    and auxiliary retirees nationwide, including 3,462 seniors throughout South Dakota.      I believe older Americans ages 65 through 69 should be able to work and supplement their Social Security without    a benefit reduction, just as other beneficiaries can supplement, without restriction, their Social Security with    pensions and unearned income.      At a time when labor shortages loom on the horizon and people are living longer, we should encourage, not penalize,    older workers.      Faced with serious health care expenses, escalating prescription drug prices, long term care needs, and other    expenses in caring for a spouse or other family members, older Americans are choosing to stay in the job market    longer. By eliminating the earnings test today we have just improved the personal and financial well-being of thousands    of seniors throughout South Dakota and our nation.      I am very pleased that President Clinton is supportive of the legislation and has indicated that he will sign    the bill into law immediately.      Today marks a strong vote for older Americans. Seniors are one of our nation's most valuable resources and we    should honor and respect them by providing the means necessary to live long, fulfilling lives without worrying    about whether or not they can afford to pay their rent, heating bill, and other necessities. As we move forward    with the 106th Congress, I look forward to working with my fellow colleagues to implement further programs and    a strong legislative agenda which strengthens crucial programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and establishes    prescription drug coverage, nursing home reforms, new efforts on long-term care, tools to fight crimes against    seniors, new plans to secure retirements and protect pensions, and other initiatives that meet the needs of our    growing population of seniors.      Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for too many years I have worked in support of repealing the unfair Annual Earnings    Test on Social Security. Incredibly, working seniors currently forfeit one dollar of Social Security benefits for    every $3 they earn over the earnings limit of $17,000.      If an American spends a lifetime paying into the Social Security system with the guarantee that he or she will    get their money when he or she turns 62 or 65 years old, no one should be able to take those benefits away simply    because the beneficiary wants to keep working. Why should the federal government be discouraging those seniors    who want to keep on working from doing so? As our country faces increasing demands for labor, we can ill afford    to deprive ourselves of the skills and experience America's seniors have to offer. The federal government shouldn't    be in the position of discouraging anyone from working: seniors should be allowed to make their own decisions.      Over the past few weeks, I have listened to and read the comments of numerous Washington state seniors who lose    a portion of their hard-earned Social Security benefits simply because they do not wish to retire or stop working.    I have been listening to these same comments for many years, and I can honestly say that today it looks as if common    sense will finally prevail and a solution will pass the House and the Senate. Importantly, President Clinton recently    changed his position on this issue and now says he will sign this legislation to abolish the Earnings Test.      I will cast my vote for abolishing this unfair tax. Repeal of the Social Security Earnings Test is a victory    for seniors and every generation of Americans.      Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today--Republicans and Democrats alike--in voting    to repeal the Social security earnings test. For 75 years now, Congress has kept a provision in the Social Security    program that hurts our seniors who continue to work. The Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is a sensible measure.    It will correct an injustice in our Social Security program, infuse our tight labor market with experienced workers,    and most importantly, help hundreds of thousands of seniors become more financially secure.      Currently, retirees drawing Social Security benefits are subject to an earnings test. This means that for seniors    ages 65 to 69, benefits are deferred by $1 for every $3 that their earnings exceed $17,000. In my state, nearly    2,500 seniors are hurt by the Social Security earnings test. According to the Social Security Administration, the    average amount of benefits lost per recipient in 1995 was $3,596. My state benefits from the contributions of these    employees, substantively and economically; yet these individuals are being penalized for their efforts.      It is now time for Congress to bring the Social Security program into a new era. Retiring the earnings test,    not our seniors, is a first step.      In 1935, when the Social Security program was established, the United States had a crowded labor field. The    earnings test was designed to encourage seniors to leave the work force to open their jobs to younger people. But    today the rationale for the test has faded. It's about time we replaced this antiquated provision.      Indeed, no one today would seriously consider structuring the program to discourage older workers. Our unemployment    rate is at an historic low. And our country is enjoying unprecedented economic prosperity. Seniors bring years    of experience to the work force--knowledge and judgment that cannot be obtained from a textbook, but only from    first-hand experience. Employers today are seeking skilled, dependable, and honest employees. Many older Americans    would be willing to fill this need if they were not faced with decreased Social Security benefits. The government    should not tell people who want to work that they cannot, but this is exactly the message the earnings test sends    to many seniors. This message is discriminatory and fundamentally wrong.      Moreover, at a time when we are experiencing such phenomenal economic growth, many of our senior citizens are    struggling to pay for everyday needs. This measure will help them. I have heard from hundreds of seniors from North    Carolina who are struggling to pay their medical bills and daily living costs. By now, they have been working and    paying Social Security taxes for decades. These same seniors are the ones who start to lose benefits because they    continue to work, simply because they earn a salary that the government believes is too high for them.      It must be said that this legislation is a patch to one problem in the Social Security system that is currently    riddled with holes. If Congress does not start considering overall Social Security reform, we will eventually have    a hole too big to fix. It is my hope that the current momentum to fix small holes in the system will lead to a    larger dialogue on how to save the Social Security program.      But until then, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is a win-win measure. It lets seniors earn a higher    salary without retribution. It keeps skilled employees in the workplace. It helps maintain a strong economy. It    helps our seniors to afford today's cost of living. And finally, it's the right thing to do.      This bill has a lot of benefits, and it costs the government nothing. I look forward to its quick passage in    the Senate and to the positive effects that it will have for our country.           [Page: S1538]      Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in my State of Michigan, we currently have less than a 3 percent rate of unemployment.      We used to think that just the people entering and leaving the job market, as well as those switching jobs,    would keep unemployment to a minimum of 5 percent.      But our economy is exceptionally strong, and the demand for labor is through the roof. In fact, some companies    in Michigan have threatened to leave the State because they can't find enough people to work.      Yet throughout the United States, we encourage our seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 to not work because    of the earnings test on their Social Security benefits.      At the very time that we need experienced workers in the labor market, the government makes it uneconomical    for our most experienced workers to stay in the work force.      Under the current earnings test, Social Security beneficiaries under the age of 65 lose $1 of social Security    benefits for every $2 they earn over $10,000 per year.      And those under 70 lose $1 for every $3 earned over $17,000 of annual income.      Not until they reach 70 years of age are seniors free to work again on their own terms.      Seniors are being penalized by double taxation--and in this case, simply for working.      I find it incredible that we force our seniors to forego over $3.9 billion a year in Social Security benefits    simply because they make more than $10,800 if they are under 65 and $17,000 if they are between 65 and 69 years    of age.      But what is not seen is the income foregone by those seniors for whom the earnings test makes it uneconomical    to work.      A recent study by the Institute for Policy Innovation shows that your typical 67-year-old married senior, making    let's say the American average of $37,000, could have a marginal tax rate of over 80 percent.      This is a huge disincentive to continue working, even though we need these experienced seniors in our work force,    many of them want to work, and they are able to do so.      In fact, a recent study by the Urban Institute indicated that because of longer life expectancies and better    medical care, a 65-year-old today is healthier than a 40-year-old was before World War II.      This has the effect of forcing able workers out of the work force. In 1948, 47 percent of men over 65 worked.    Today, it's one-third of that with about 16 percent continuing to work.      And if they do work, they limit how much they work because of the earnings test. In fact, 65 percent of those    seniors that work, keep their total earnings under the earnings test limit in order to avoid the penalties.      But if we repealed the earnings test, we could unleash the economic power of our seniors.      The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that repealing the earnings test on workers age 65 to 69    would increase the annual number of hours worked throughout the economy by 5.3 percent.      That may not seem to be much, but it actually represents 63 million more hours worked per year, or the equivalent    of almost 31,500 jobs.      Because seniors would have more money to save, invest, and spend, it's estimated that overall gross domestic    product would rise by $19.5 billion, increasing the projected growth in disposable personal income by more than    5 percent.      And this would ripple throughout the economy, adding $6.8 billion to the stock of U.S. capital invested in new    jobs.      Finally, the extra growth that would be brought about by this repeal would generate enough new tax collections    to totally offset the higher Social Security benefit payments within 10 years.      That is why I was proud to join Senator  McCain  last year in cosponsoring S. 279 to repeal this    antiquated test and allow our seniors to keep all of their Social Security benefits. And that is why I will also    support passage of H.R. 5.      But I think we need to look at the broader issues of retirement security, including the taxation of Social Security    benefits, and the forced depletions of individual retirement accounts.      In 1993, the President forced through an increase on the amount of Social Security benefits subject to taxation    from 50 to 85 percent for those singles making more than $34,000 and those couples making over $44,000.      When coupled with the earnings test, these benefits taxes can punish some couples with a 103 percent marginal    tax rate. These couples actually lose more than a dollar for making another dollar. Not only is this grossly unfair,    it's also an even further disincentive for savings and work.      But the government's raid on senior's retirements assets doesn't even stop there. It also levies a 50 percent    tax on IRA savings when seniors fail to withdraw when Washington wants them withdrawn.      Current law requires seniors to start withdrawing their IRA savings beginning at age 70 1/2 .      And seniors must usually make these withdrawals in annual amounts large enough to deplete the entire IRA by    the time they reach age 85.      Failure to follow these rules earns a whopping 50 percent penalty.      This withdrawal requirement can only be viewed as a punishment for those who plan and save for retirement. Even    worse, seniors who live past 85 may find themselves short on funds because the Federal Government forced them to    spend their own savings. That's not right, and it must be stopped.      To remedy all of these gross disincentives to seniors planning and saving for their retirement, and staying    active in the work force, I introduced the Senior Citizens' Financial Freedom Act, S. 2180.      This legislation would accomplish three objectives:      First, it would repeal the Social Security earnings test working penalty on seniors, just as the legislation    before us today would.      Second, it would roll back the Clinton administration's 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits.      Finally, it would increase the age when minimum IRA distributions must begin, from 70 1/2 to 85.      Passage of H.R. 5 is vitally important to the financial well being of our seniors who chose to remain in the    work force.      And I hope we will continue to work toward truly protecting the financial well-being of America's seniors by    also addressing this year the other issues of Social Security benefits taxation and forced IRA withdrawals.      With these two important pieces of legislation, we can really strengthen Social Security for our seniors in    the most important place possible--their wallets.      Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate is going to take an important and long overdue step to stop penalizing    older workers in our Nation--eliminating the Social Security earnings penalty. This is a change I have advocated    for many years. So I am very pleased we are taking this important step.      This legislation, H.R. 5, is an important step for a number of reasons. First, it is simply the right thing    to do. There should not be a penalty for working.      Second, we are now facing and will continue to face tight labor markets. In my State of Iowa, this is an acute    problem in some areas. By eliminating the earnings penalty, experienced workers who were discouraged from continuing    in or rejoining the work force will have a new incentive to work. The emergence of the Internet and home computers    offers tremendous opportunities for seniors to work at home. Marrying these new job opportunities with a repeal    of the earnings penalty will become even more important as the Baby Boomers retire.      Third, a large number of older Americans need the income. Over half of today's workers have no pension plans    outside of Social Security. They are going to need additional sources of income to maintain their standard of living.      Some critics have expressed concern that this change would have a negative budgetary impact. I believe that    by attracting more Americans back into the work force, either on a full-time or part-time basis, it will strengthen    Social Security and the federal budget. And I believe they will add to the productivity of our nation.      I am pleased that the Senate has been able to come together on a strong bipartisan basis to pass this bill.    The President has indicated his support and so it should become the law of the land in the next few weeks. That    would be a good step forward for our Nation.           [Page: S1539]      Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments on the Social Security earnings test elimination bill.    Today I join my Senate colleagues in supporting important legislation that will benefit millions of American seniors    who want to remain working after age 65 without facing a reduction in their Social Security benefits.      In America today there are roughly 800,000 Social Security recipients between the ages of 65 and 70. Under current    law if you are one of those 800,000 Americans and you earn more than $17,000 this year you will begin to see a    reduction, $1 in loss for every $3 earned over $17,000 in Social Security benefits. I think it is important to    recognize that those being penalized are those who have been paying into Social Security their entire working lives.    I have long disapproved of this punitive system that places restrictions on a person's right to work, and an employer's    ability to hire the right person for the job. Too often Social Security is viewed as a handout, but for the vast    majority of Americans this is an earned benefit that should not be subject to Depression-era work restrictions.      The Members of this body are familiar with the numerous obstacles facing employers, particularly small business    owners, in these times of near full employment. In my home State of Colorado, our small businesses, hospitality    and tourism employers are struggling to find experienced, qualified individuals even in these times of prosperity.    Here in the Senate we have looked at increasing the number of guest workers visas and streamlining the visa process    in an effort to provide employers with an opportunity to reach employees. While we will still consider these efforts,    the passage of the Social Security earnings test elimination bill will allow employers to tap an eager and rich    population of employees already living in every community in our State. Importantly, this legislation will put    an end to a depressing practice that has forced working seniors to leave their jobs mid-year once their earnings    threshold has been reached. Not only will America's working seniors be spared unnecessary grief, but these seniors    and their employers will be free to develop stable, life-long working relationships.      The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation will cost $22.7 billion over the next 10    years. I understand that actuaries from the Social Security Administration have reported that this cost will be    negligible over the long term. I mention this solely in the context that as we pass this legislation we recognize    that this measure is associated with a cost. Congress must budget appropriately in response to this cost. Repealing    the earnings limit is an idea whose time has come, whose time came years ago. Part of constructing good public    policy is making hard choices. I hope that my colleagues will recognize that if we are not willing to assume the    responsibilities of these costs in other areas of the budget we run the risk of continued fiscal irresponsibility    that threatens Social Security and a balanced Federal budget.      Like many of my colleagues in the Senate today I had the good fortune to work on a precursor to this legislation    when I served in the House of Representatives. During the 104th Congress I voted in favor of H.R. 2491, the budget    reconciliation bill that carried a number of provisions outlined in the Contract with America. One of these provisions    was the gradual increase of the Social Security earnings limit. In December 1995, President Clinton vetoed this    legislation. I am thankful that today the Senate will pass this legislation overwhelmingly, insuring relief and    increased economic freedom for America's seniors.      Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, when the Social Security system was established, a retirement test, also referred to    as an earnings test, was made part of the criteria for determining an individual's benefits. This criterion was    established because Social Security benefits are intended to replace, in part, earnings lost by an individual or    family because of retirement, disability, or death. Therefore, benefits are withheld from individuals who show    by their substantial earnings from work that they are not in fact `retired'.      What this means today is that recipients aged 62-65 could earn up to $10,080 annually without having their benefits    affected, and those between 65-69 could earn up to $17,000 a year. For earnings above these limits, recipients    aged 62-65 lose $1 in benefits for each $2 of earnings while those between 65 and 69 lose $1 in benefits for each    $3 in earnings. The earnings test does not apply to recipients age 70 and over, and the exempt limits increase    each year at the same rate as average wages in the economy. Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately    600,000 recipients age 65-69 affected by the earnings limit test.      Today we are repealing the earnings limit for people between the full retirement age and age 69, giving them    the opportunity for increased financial security, and providing an increase in skilled workers during this tight    labor market.      Removing the earnings limit will provide seniors with greater independence and financial security. Today, too    many Americans struggle through their retirement years trying to make ends meet. The steps we take today will allow    seniors to work longer, and depend on their savings less, giving them more security into their later years. In    our modern workplace it makes no sense to penalize workers for staying in the workforce longer. Congress works    hard to encourage people to plan their retirement years thoughtfully, and removing the earnings limit will give    working families one more tool for planning their financial future.      This move is especially timely in our tight labor market and booming economy. Removing the earnings limit will    allow experienced workers to be able to stay in the workforce. I have heard from several business owners in Wisconsin    who are desperate for skilled workers in a number of industries. While the long term answer to the skilled worker    shortage is increased worker training and education, encouraging older workers to remain in the workforce will    certainly help meet the current demand. Proven, experienced, mature workers will help our economy maintain its    momentum.      We should not feel too jubilant, however, about today's accomplishment. Comprehensive Social Security Reform    is still necessary. Today's changes will do nothing to hold off the coming crisis that will begin when we start    drawing down the Social Security Trust fund in 2014. Congress needs to deal with this soon, otherwise we are shirking    our duty to the American people.      Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senior Citizens'    Freedom to Work Act. It is high time we eliminated this Depression-era provision which penalizes motivated senior    citizens for working to augment their Social Security income.      As the law currently stands, if a person between the ages of 65 and 69 earns more than $17,000 per year, their    Social Security benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 they earn above $17,000. That just isn't right. Ours is    a society which values hard work; only our Government would devise a scheme to penalize people for working.      Before too long, in 2025, Montana will have the third largest proportion of senior citizens in the Nation. This    growth rate is nationwide, however. Our country is aging and the programs which our parents relied on in their    golden years need to change if they are to keep pace with the changing face of American society.      Most of the senior citizens affected by this unfair provision are those who can afford it the least. These are    the very people who struggle to make ends meet every month. Many may face the impossible decision of putting food    on their tables or prescriptions in their drug cabinets. We expect retirees to augment their Social Security income    with money from outside resources but then turn around and penalize them for working. Isn't it about time to bring    consistency into Social Security? Eliminating the Social Security earnings limit is one important step in reforming    the laws which affect our senior citizens.      I urge the Senate to follow the House of Representatives by expediting passage of this important legislation.    Working seniors deserve no less.      Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.      Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens Freedom to    Work Act. This bill will do away with the Social Security earnings test for those individuals between the ages    of 65 to 69. The earnings test has proved to be a disincentive for able and healthy senior citizens to be a productive    part of the workforce. On March 1, the House of Representatives approved H.R. 5 by a vote of 422-0. Moreover, the    administration has expressed its support for the bill. While I believe the amendment offered by Senator  Kerrey     had merit, attaching it to this bill would have delayed enactment of this important legislation. Therefore,    it is my belief that we should pass this bill immediately and send it to the President for his approval.           [Page: S1540]      Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for repealing the Social Security Earnings Test    for working seniors. Many of my colleagues and I have been working together for the past 12 years to pass this    legislation. At long last, the Senate is going to retire the Social Security Earnings Test.      The Social Security Earnings Test is a 70 year old dinosaur of a law which was initiated to insure that Social    Security benefits were granted specifically to retired persons. Today, unfortunately, economic reality dictates    the need for many senior citizens to continue working in order to achieve a basic standard of living. The Social    Security Earnings Test stands as a roadblock to independence for tens of thousands of seniors throughout the United    States. Furthermore, America's seniors represent a wealth of talent and skill. A national policy which discourages    them from working is simply counterproductive.      Clearly, few other states have been as impacted by the unfair Social Security Earnings Test as the people in    my home state of Florida. I've seen first-hand the impact upon Seniors of laws which limit income. We have already    seen the impact caused by President Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Seniors, when he raised the Social Security benefit    tax from 50% up to 85%. When are we, as a nation, going to stop penalizing success?      It's not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the earnings test restrictions. It's lower    and moderate income Seniors who need some relief from their government to simply survive. In Florida, we are talking    about grandparents who live on Social Security plus any outside work they can get. And if you have grandma in the    hospital or a nursing home fighting Alzheimer's Disease, and grandpa has go find some work to pay the bills, the    Social Security Earnings Test is simply another hurdle they have to overcome.      Several years ago, I was visiting a worksite in Safety Harbor, Florida where I met with a group of working Seniors.    I asked them why they were working past the traditional retirement age. Some said they simply wanted to have a    reason to get out of the house and do something productive. Others said they needed the additional income to take    care of a loved one. Still others said they wanted to maintain a certain lifestyle without Federal interference.      But I was most struck by one gentleman who said to me, `Senator, we live in a throw away society. Don't let    them throw us away.' What this gentleman was saying was that the message the Earnings Test sends is that society    no longer needs you. How can we, as a society, say such a thing? Clearly, we shouldn't.      Finally, consider this thought. Baseball fans might remember my grandfather, Connie Mack, who spent many years    in major league baseball. In 1929, he managed the World Champion Philadelphia Athletics. In 1929, he was 66 years    old. Suppose he had succumbed to the idea that, at that age, there was no purpose for pursuing one's ideas, one's    dreams in life. Suppose he had been told by our nation that he was no longer of value to society. He might not    have had the opportunity to produce that great team. Fortunately, we didn't have a law which could have forced    him into retirement.      The Federal government is sending a message to working Seniors that they are over the hill. The only thing that    is over the hill is the Earnings Test. We need to retire the Earnings Test, not our Seniors.      Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.      The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.  Frist ). Is there a sufficient second?      There appears to be a sufficient second.      Who seeks time?      Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we yield back any remaining time.      Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we yield back any remaining time.      The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, under the previous order, the clerk will read the    bill for the third time.      The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time.      The bill was read a third time.      The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass? The clerk    will call the roll.      The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.      -      The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:           Rollcall Vote No. 42 Leg.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous order be postponed for 3 minutes.      The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.      Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is a moment of high achievement. Is there anybody about who can remember when    a substantive piece of legislation affecting millions of Americans and dealing with the Social Security Act would    pass this Chamber 100-0? I can't in my 24 years.      In my 24 years, I have not seen the like.      I congratulate the chairman who had the wisdom to bring up the matter, hold it at the desk, and do it this way.      When the President gets back, I am sure the first thing he will do is sign it, or we can put it on a plane and    send it to meet him halfway in Geneva.      But congratulations.      Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member, Senator  Moynihan , for his    kind and gracious but too generous remarks. I know we were able to get this accomplished through his leadership.    As I said earlier, I do not only want to congratulate him for his role today, but for his continuing role in his    many years of service in the Senate. I thank him for his leadership, for his contribution, and for his steadiness    on this most important matter.      I also say to my distinguished colleague that it is important we recognize the staff who worked so hard on this    historic measure on the majority side.      I thank Frank Polk, Alec Vachon of the majority staff; on the minority side, David Podoff and Jon Resnick. I    also thank David Koitz of the Congressional Research Service, Ruth Ernst of the Senate Legislative Counsel, and    Kathy Ruffing of the Congressional Budget Office. Frankly, if it had not been for their hours of long staff work,    this historic bill would not have been possible.      Mr. President, I yield the floor.           [Page: S1541]      END

The report contains a set of eight analyses that are based on 5 months of primary and secondary research and on interviews with over 70 individuals and 40 organizations in India and the United States. Each chapter begins with a statement of the scope of work, followed by a response. This chapter will describe and analyze the recent history and current state of bilateral US-Indian collaborative ventures or partnerships in development.  Identify and describe the principal factors underlying the appearance of such ventures, including the impact of the Indian Diaspora. From the early 1950s through the 1980s, the US nongovernmental (NGO) presence in India was dominated by a few large organizations that included the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, CARE and Catholic Relief Services.1 Economic liberalization in India in the early 1990s and the economic success of the large number of Indian nationals who have taken up residence in the United States has fostered growth in USIndian alliances over the past decade.2 As an indicator of the potential for US-Indian collaborations, the World Bank's Development Market Place initiative last year received about 90 proposals for work in India involving collaborations between Indian organizations and entities in developed countries. Nineteen of these proposals were submitted by American organizations  universities, private voluntary organizations, and scientific organizations  for implementation in India with some level of local Indian partnership. The following factors were cited in recent discussions with stakeholders in the US and India as factors that have favorably affected the formation of Indo-US collaborative ventures:  Economic liberalization in India: In 1991, the Indian government unveiled its New Economic Policy that presented a strategy for economic liberalization. The globalization and opening up of the Indian economy has been accompanied by increased levels of bilateral tie-ups between India and the US.3  The term NGO is used this report to describe nonpartisan, nonprofit, voluntary organizations that seek to advance the public good. 2 The growing volume of US foreign contributions into India for development purposes is one indication of the growing scale of partnership activity. Aggregate US funding has grown at an average annual growth rate of 27% since 1996, as detailed later in this report. The US is currently the largest provider of foreign contributions, having provided US$298.5 million or 33% of total funding received in 2000-2001 (see www.mha.nic.in). See Annex A for a listing of US NGOs operating in India today. 3 For example, two-way trade between the US and India in 2000 totaled US $14.35 billion, reflecting an increase of nearly 100% since 1993. During the year 2000, India's exports to USA increased by 17.65% in dollar terms, compared to 1999 (see www.indianembassy.org/indusrel/trade.htm). Also see the US India Business Council website (www.usibc.com  Current News Section) for details on current, sector-wise information on the growth of private sector and bilateral Indo-US alliances. In 2000, USIBC organized a  1   2    The healthy economic climate in the 1990s, including an increase in available venture capital, has been a contributing factor that led to ventures being established in the past decade. An increasing interest within India in the international development experience and the applicability of best practices to Indian development problems. An improved global communications infrastructure that has facilitated greater communication and information flows between Indians and Americans. An upsurge of migration from India to the US, spurred on in the late 1990s by the needs of technology companies in the US with Indians accounting for almost half of the total number of H1B (work) visas issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.4 The Indian diaspora in the US which, through its growing presence and impressive record of professional achievement, has: Raised the awareness of India and its development potential and problems in the eyes of the US public; and Positioned itself to play an important role in promoting partnerships between Indian philanthropic institutions in the US and development organizations in India. This point is discussed in further detail below.        There follows an analytical description that attempts to identify which sectors have served as a particular foci for ventures between Indians in the US and India, and the states and regions within India that have been a focus of development activity. The analysis also attempts to assess the overall development impact of these ventures. The Indian Diaspora in the United States `Diaspora' is a word used to refer to people dispersed all over the world who identify, or are identified with, a particular ethnic group. Diaspora philanthropy indicates philanthropic giving from those that constitute the diaspora to their country of origin. In this report, we examine Indian diaspora philanthropy that includes activities of Indian Americans--including non resident Indians, persons of Indian origin, and Americans of Indian ethnicity--supporting development activities in India through the provision of financial and nonfinancial support. 5 high profile Commercial Dialogue in Washington DC. At this meeting alone, US and Indian government officials signed a number of bilateral trade and investment agreements that amounted to a potential value of $6 billion. 4  As reported in the Singhvi report, despite the economic slowdown in the US, with the liberalization of the cap on H1-B visas, about 100,000 Indians are expected to enter the US annually. Of these, many will stay on. Therefore, the population of Indian Americans is expected to continue to grow in numbers (Singhvi, 175). 5 A Person of Indian Origin (PIO) is a foreign citizen who at some time has held an Indian passport; whose parents, grandparents or great grandparents were born in and permanently resident in India as defined in the   3 The Indian diaspora is positioned to play a significant role in driving India's development forward. With an average per capita income of $60,093, Indians are the wealthiest ethnic community in the United States today (Singhvi, 169).6 While this community is generous in supporting religious and charitable causes to which individuals have personal ties in India, it is only beginning to become comfortable with the American style of philanthropy that is marked by giving to institutions that decide on how and where resources will be allocated. Today, the diaspora is actively forging greater and greater numbers of partnerships with Indian organizations that it seeks to assist. Indians in America: Basic Facts and Figures  Number of Indian Americans in US (2000 Census): 1,678,765  Growth in number of Indian Americans from 1990 - 2000: 105.87%  Percentage of Indian Americans of the total US population: 0.6% (1.7 million of 281.4 million)  Per capital income: $60,093  Employment: 72.3% are employed, of which: - Managerial and professional: 43.6% - Technical, sales and services: 33.2% - Skilled laborers: 23.3% Source: Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora  A Closer Look: Some Regional Characteristics of Indian Americans According to the 2000 Census, the population of Indians in the United States is currently estimated to be 1.68 million, making them the largest immigrant group in the country (Taplin, 4). California is home to the largest number of Indians (314, 819 or 32%), followed by New York (25%), New Jersey (17%), Texas (13%) and Illinois (12.6%) as indicated in the graph below:  Population of Indian Americans: Top 5 States US Census 2000 California New York New Jersey Texas Illinois 0 50,000 169,180 129,365 124,723 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 251,724 314,819  GOI Act, 1935; or is a spouse of a citizen of India.

A recent the US, estimates the per capita to use the estimate provided by Indian Diaspora.   4 Two states alone  California and New York  account for more than 50% of the Indian population. Within California, Silicon Valley is home to a large number of Indians. San Jose is the second largest Indian city after New York City, and Santa Clara County has the third largest Indian population in the country after Queens County, NY and Cook County, IL (Taplin, 9). A large number of immigrants from India to the US come from 8 Indian states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab and Gujarat.7 This large immigrant population is characterized by a relatively high level of education. Two of every three Indian immigrants holds an advanced degree. As a result of this, the demand for Indian professionals is very high: 47.5% of the H1B work visas were granted to Indians in 1998-99. Approximately 30% are employed in professional occupations, compared to 13% of all US employees (Taplin, 9). A Closer Look: The Professional Make Up of Indian Americans The Indian American community today differs quite dramatically from the early immigrants that arrived in the US at the beginning of the 20th century.8 Unlike their predecessors that were largely engaged in agriculture, Indian Americans today are engaged in a variety of professional specialty occupations, live in urban areas in various East and West Coast locations, have relatively high levels of education, and have, through their hard work, ascended to the top-most ranks of their fields. From venture capitalists to the Patels of the hospitality business to investment bankers on the East Coast, to millionaire doctors, the success of Indian immigrants is evident in several different spheres of American life. In particular, Silicon Valley has emerged as a nucleus for Indian American entrepreneurship and success. If one were to group Indian Americans by institution, students from the Indian Institutes of Technology comprise the largest group, followed by students from the Indian Institutes of Management (CAF, 6). In terms of their occupational profile, 72.3% of all Indian Americans are employed, of which 43.6% are engaged in managerial and professional positions, 33.2% work in the service sector, and 23.3% are skilled laborers (Singhvi,170). A large number of Indian immigrants of the 60s and 70s are involved in the fields of medicine, engineering and law. It is estimated that 35% of Boeing's technical workforce is Indian. Sam Pitroda, an NRI based in Chicago and CEO of World 7  Sabeer Bhatia, founder of Hotmail, Vinod Khosla, founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Dham, father of the penitum chip, Kanwal Rekhi, and K.B Chandrashekhar are some of the prominent names in the technology field today.  Tel, has contributed greatly to the  The consulting team was not able to locate accurate estimates of disaggregated state-wise data of Indian immigration to the US. 8 Indian immigration to the US occurred in three distinct phases: first, about a hundred years ago, when Sikhs from the Punjab immigrated to the West Coast seeing to work in California's fields and Washington's lumber mills; second, in the 1950s and 1960s when Indian professionals, including doctors, scientists, and engineers, emigrated to the States following passing of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965; and finally, in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, when there was an influx of students from the newly emergent middle class who went on to make great strides as entrepreneurs in the high technology world of Silicon Valley (CAF, 5).   5 expansion of telecommunications in India. Amar Bose has established an acoustics systems company that is recognized world-wide. About 300,000 Indian Americans work in technology firms in Silicon Valley. Their average income is estimated to be $200,000 and they account for more than 15% of high tech start-ups. There are about 650-700 Indian owned companies in Silicon Valley today. Several Indians serve as faculty members in the field of higher education in American universities. Jagdish Bhagwati, Professor of Economics at Columbia University, is prominent among them. The Indian community has also endowed Chairs on Indian studies, such as the Chair on Indian History at Brown University and University of California, as well as a Jagdish Bhagwati Professorship on Indian Political Economy at Columbia University in New York. Indian Americans are involved in the field of international finance and management as well. Prominent among these are Victor Menezes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Citibank, and Rajat Gupta, Managing Director (Worldwide) of McKinsey and Co. There are several prominent names in the fields of journalism, writing, films and music. Pankaj Mishra (author) regularly contributes to the New York Times and has published literature on India that has been well received. Jhumpa Lahiri, author of Interpreter of Maladies, received a Pulitzer Prize for her work. Dr. Fareed Zakaria has taken over as Editor of Newsweek magazine. Ravi Shankar, Zakir Hussain, Ali Akbar Khan, and Zubin Mehta are world class musicians. In the world of film, Mira Nair and M. Knight Shyamalan are well known names. About 23.3% of the Indian population is engaged in occupations such as taxi drivers, factory workers, newsstand workers and farmers (Singhvi, 170). Recent history and current state of bilateral tie-ups Bilateral tie-ups for development between the US and India primarily take two forms: 1) Financial transfers of resources; and 2) Nonfinancial transfers of resources. In terms of financial transfers, foreign contributions9 being channeled into India from the United States are highlighted in the table below: 1996-97 582.22 9  Aggregate US Funding to India (crore rupees)10 1997-98 1998-99 1999-00 2000-2001 731.07 892.43 1086.32 1492.62  Annual average growth rate 27%  Foreign contribution is defined as the donation, delivery or transfer, made by any foreign source of any a) article, not given to a person as a gift, for personal use, if the market value, in India, of such article exceeds one thousand rupees b) currency, whether Indian or foreign c) foreign security as defined in clause 2(I) of the Foreign Exchange (Regulation) Act, 1973.

Source: Accountable Handbook, 7 and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA): www.mha.nic.in.  As the table indicates, foreign contributions to India from the US have been steadigly growing. In 2000-2001, India received a total of Rs. 4523.23 crores (US$ 904.6 million) in foreign contributions. The US contribution to this figure is the largest, amounting to Rs.1492.62 crores (US$ 298.5 million) or 33% of total funding.  Largest Foreign Donors (2000-2001) 1) World Vision International, USA (Rs. 80.43 crores; US$ 16.1 million). 2) Foster Parents Plan International, USA (Rs. 76.37 crores; US$ 15.3 million).  3) Watch Tower Bible and Track Society, There is also a growing trend of volunteerism that USA (Rs. 68.11 crores; US$ 13.6 million). helps build a deeper connection to the motherland.

The organization is Source: MHA Website: www.mha.nic.in. currently strategizing to meet this need (personal interview, Kishore). New organizations are emerging that exclusively focus on building volunteerism as well. One such example is Indicorps, a nonprofit organization that provides fellowships to individuals to work in partnership with an Indian development organization. The organization is based in the US, but as it enters its third year, is in the process of establishing an India-based entity that will oversee and administer its growing program.  While no data currently exists that quantifies the extent of these nonfinancial contributions, anecdotal information suggests a growing trend in this direction. Modes of giving and motivations to contribute Our discussions with Indian Americans revealed that a major reason behind the diaspora's involvement in Indian philanthropy is emotional ties to their country of origin, and the desire to give back to make it a better place for future generations. A large number of Indian Americans, it has been observed, are motivated to contribute by the desire to be recognized. Philanthropy that is visible shows that the he/she ""has arrived"" and is no longer struggling (interview, Reddy, 2003). This is especially true among earlier generation of immigrants.   7 A lot of Indians are motivated by the guilt factor, especially those that have been privileged and benefited from free education received at one of India's premier technical or management institutions and are now utilizing the skills gained toward contributing to the US economy (interview, Sequeira, 2003). The Indian diaspora's mode of ""giving back"" has, for the most part, taken the form of personally motivated giving to organizations with which the giver has some personal connection. The recent proliferation of Indian American organizations that has taken place over the past ten years demonstrates, however, that this mode of philanthropy is changing, so that it is increasingly being organized and channeled through institutions. A variety of Indian American organizations and networks have taken root, and have developed along professional, religious, and cultural lines. Professional associations: A number of professional organizations representing Indian American interests are operational today. Prominent among these are the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), the Asian American Hotel Owner's Association (AAHOA), the Indus Entrepreneurs (Tie), the Network for Indian Environmental Professionals (NIEP), the Network for Indian Professionals (NetIP), the Indian Business and Professional Women (IBPW), and the US-India Business Council. Cultural and religious groups: Cultural and religious groups have also served as a channel for Indian American philanthropy. A variety of regional associations exist today that serve as a forum for their communities. Examples of these associations include the Telegu Association of North America (established in 1977), the Gujarati Association (1979), the Federation of Kerala Associations (1983), and the Bengali Association of North America (BANA). Student groups in the US: The 1990s have seen a proliferation of student-led voluntary efforts. Active among these are Asha for Education, the Association for India's Development, and the Rejuvenate India Movement (RIM), which was officially launched in 1999 and currently has more than 400 supporters throughout the US. Principal factors underlying the appearance of such ventures There has been an increase in the degree of these exchanges in the past decade. Several reasons have been discussed already. In addition, the following factors provide an explanation of why this has occurred with relation to diaspora contributions in particular:  Globalization has resulted in greater movement in terms of human capital between the two countries. Enrollment in US colleges and universities by people of Indian origin has increased dramatically over the past decade.11 As a consequence, a number of campus-based voluntary groups have emerged and are actively engaged in channeling development assistance to India for a diversity of causes including  India sent more students to study in the United States than any other country in the 2001-2002 academic year, topping the list for the first time with 66,836 students or 11.5% of all international students in the United States doing bachelors or graduate degrees in US colleges and universities. This number represents a 22% increase from the year before, according to a study which was funded by the US State Department's Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs and produced by the Institute for International Education, 2002.  11   8 humanitarian purposes, disaster relief, education, and general social development projects. A large number of graduates of these institutions have gone on to establish themselves successfully in the US private sector, including Silicon Valley. Today, the software industry serves as a critical catalyst in facilitating bilateral flows of investment and technology between the two countries. Indian educational institutions, in turn, have been actively seeking tie-ups with USbased universities as a way of building capacity and acquiring an international brand name. A prominent example of an educational partnership is the recent establishment of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. This school has a formal affiliation with the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania, the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University, and the London School of Business. Faculty are routinely drawn from these schools to teach classes. This educational venture was set up by a group of dynamic Indian and American entrepreneurs who worked in conjunction with prominent academics to establish a curriculum and design other academic activities.       Assess the extent to which certain sectors have served as particular foci for these ventures. Sector focus of contributions In looking at sector-wise foreign contribution information provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the largest amount of (aggregate US and non US) funding was received for rural development (Rs. 547.74 crores or $109.4 million) followed by health care & family welfare (Rs. 432.98 crores or $86.6 million), and relief for natural calamities (Rs. 339.77 crores or $67.9 million) (Ministry of Home Affairs). A significant part of US foreign contributions is directed at faith-based activities and organizations. The largest US sources of foreign contributions are faith-based organizations and include World Vision International, and the Watch Tower Bible and IIT Initiative Track Society. Kanwal Rekhi, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is currently engaged in an effort to mobilize resources for the Indian Institutes of Our research revealed that education is a key Technology. His goal: $1 billion to upgrade the area of emphasis by the diaspora. This is due institutions throughout India. The graduates of to the fact that education is perceived as a high these institutes, spread across the USA, have leverage sector that is critical to the future formed a transcontinental network called ""The Friends of IIT"" that connects Bombay, progress of India. Funding for institutes of Hyderabad, Silicon Valley, Boston, and Seattle. higher education has been occurring for quite a while now. The most recent example of this is Vinod Khosla's gift of $5 million to IIT Mumbai. A number of newer organizations, however, are extending support to primary education activities and literacy initiatives. These groups include Asha, India Literacy Project and the Association for India's Development.   9  Interviews with US stakeholders confirmed that education remains a key area of focus for Indian Americans. Other sectors that are regarded as important by Indian Americans included technology promotion (also regarded as a high leverage sector), women's empowerment, primary health, and family planning. Infrastructure development, poverty programs, and the environment are other areas that are of interest to this funding group.  $6 Million for Alma Mater In January, 2003, two former Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) students announced at an IIT alumni gathering in California a $6-million donation for their alma mater as a payback to the prestigious schools from which they graduated. Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, donated $5 million to the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. The institute will use the funding to start a new school of information technology. Mumbai IIT-ian Avi Nash, who is an advisory director at Goldman Sachs in New York, announced a $1-million donation to the chemical engineering department of IIT, Bombay, for research laboratories, endowments for chair professorship and awards for faculty and student excellence.   Assess the extent to which certain states or regions have served as foci for these ventures. State-wise distribution of foreign contributions Subsequent to the economic liberalization program initiated in 1991, almost all states have created offices or task forces to coordinate foreign direct investment and receive funds from Indian American sources. The extent to which individual states have served as a focus for philanthropic activities by Indian Americans, however, differs widely. While almost all the states have a few outstanding examples to boast of, overall, Punjab, Kerala and Gujarat have been the focus of most (US and non US) NRI/PIO activity (Singhvi, 540). No data exists that quantifies US diaspora contributions by state. However, data does exist to indicate state-wise aggregate inflows of foreign contributions. These figures are useful to look at since they provide a spatial sense of how aid is distributed across India. The table below indicates state-wise distribution of foreign contributions. Information is provided for the first 10 largest recipients of foreign contributions only: Total foreign contributions received in 1999-2000 (lakhs) 1 Delhi 63,611 ($127.2 mill) 2 Tamil Nadu 57,251 ($114.5 mill) 3 Andhra Pradesh 53,699 ($107.4 mill) 4 Karnataka 41,134 ($82.3 mill) 5 Kerala 36,170 ($72.3 mill) 6 Maharashtra 35,023 ($70 mill) 7 West Bengal 23,399 ($46.8 mill) 8 Uttar Pradesh 12,810 ($25.6 mill) 9 Gujarat 12,695 ($25.4 mill) 10 Orissa 11,165 ($22.3 mill) Source: Accountable Handbook, pg. 17. State Percent of total contributions received 16% 14.5% 13.6% 10.4% 9% 8.8% 5.9% 3.2% 3.2% 2.8%   10  The major states that receive funding include Delhi, and the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Maharashtra is also significant in this regard. More recent figures provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) indicate that in 2001-2002, among the states and union territories, Delhi reported the largest amount of foreign contributions (Rs 763.05 crores or $152.6 million) followed by Tamil Nadu (Rs. 649.45 crores or $129.9 million) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs. 589.52 crores or $117.9 million) (MHA website: http://mha.nic.in/fore.htm). Reaching out to the Diaspora: State-level initiatives in three states Highlighted below are initiatives undertaken by three states that are active in soliciting diaspora support. a) Kerala: Kerala has set up the Non-Resident Keralites Affairs Department (NORKA). This department is vested with the responsibility of attracting investment for Kerala and streamlining interactions between the Non Resident Keralites (NRK) and various government departments. It is also charged with addressing issues related to the personal welfare of NRKs, including investigating fraudulent recruitment agencies, abuse of women NRIs such as housemaids and providing emergency assistance to deportees. Some of its significant achievements including the launching of the Pravasi Suraksha Insurance scheme for unemployed returnees, as well as the NRK Infrastructure Initiative Fund to channel NRK investment to infrastructure projects. b) Punjab: This state has pioneered the use of a non-governmental body called the NRI Sabha to work with the NRIs/PIOs. The Sabha, under the patronage of the Chief Minister and led by the Commissioner for NRIs, is constituted of democratically elected members. Nodal officers in each government department report to the Commissioner. The Sabha addresses the welfare of the NRI/PIO community by protecting their rights especially related to landed property, facilitate their interaction with the state and central government, coordinate investment activity and provide a forum for dialogue among concerned parties. Some key achievements of the Sabha include the amendment of the Security of Land Tenures Act in favor of PIOs based on lobbying by the Sabha, preparation of a PIO investment policy that is under consideration of the state government, creation of a special NRI cell in the Chief Minister's secretariat, and an NRI help line in the offices of key district-level administrators, among others. c) Gujarat: The creation of an NRI division under the supervision of the Chief Minister with a separate minister in charge is a critical step taken by the state to court its NRI/PIO community. This division works in tandem with a foundation called the Gujarat Rajya Bin Niwasi Gujarati Pratisthan (Non-Resident Gujarati Foundation) for addressing the problems of NRIs. Activities of this foundation include the setting up of an NRG Bhavan in Ahmedabad to provide residential accommodation and a business center for Non-Resident Gujaratis, signing of Charters of Friendship with relevant Associations in the North America, Europe and Africa (Singhvi, 543).   11   Assess the overall development impact of these ventures. There is no database that captures reliable data relating to diaspora philanthropy today and no evaluations or impact assessments have been carried out to assess aggregate developmental impact.12 However, individual and institution-specific information does exist with respect to ventures formed and their contributions to Indian development. We present below highlights of a few of these select ventures in an attempt to shed some light on the question of development impact. Individual Philanthropy. The list of individuals that are engaged in philanthropic efforts in India is significant and ever increasing. Most recently, Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, donated $5 million to his alma mater IIT Delhi to strengthen the institution. K.B Chandrashekhar, co- founder of Exodus Communications, contributed to a center at the Madras Institute of Technology. B.V. Jagdeesh, fellow co-founder of Exodus Communications, contributed $1 million towards schools in Bangalore. Dr. Nilima Sabharwal, a San Jose pathologist, founded Home of Hope which raised $20,000 in 1999 for an orphanage in Chennai. Om Dutt Sharma, a New York taxi driver, established a school in his native village and now hopes to build a hospital. Sharad Dixit, a retired plastic surgeon from New York, has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for performing and supervising some 44,000 free surgeries to fight deformities in India. Vinod Gupta of InfoUSA founded the Vinod Gupta School of Management in India and established a polytechnic for women in Rampur. Pavan Nigam, co-founder of Healtheon WebMD, has launched a free IT training institute in Kanpur. Prabhu Goel, founder of Gateway Design Automation, has contributed $10 million to set up the Foundation for Excellence to fund the education of underprivileged students in India (Singhvi, 177). Institutional philanthropy American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI). Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, AAPI is one of America's premier medical associations that represents the interests of 35,000 Indian American physicians. The goals of the organization are to establish basic medical care clinics for the poor and needy in remote areas of India, (and underserved areas of the United States); facilitate donations of medical equipment (including pacemakers, heart valves, catheters, microscopes, surgical instruments, dialysis machines and incubators) and supplies to government/municipal run or privately-run charitable hospitals in India; and to raise scholarship funds for Indian American Medical Students. Since 10-12 percent of the freshman medical students in the United States are of Indian heritage, AAPI has created a ""Clerkship Program"" in alliance with the Indian Ministry of Health and medical schools in India. This program is designed to help Indian American freshman medical students in the US learn medicine as it is practiced in India while enjoying their cultural heritage. The organization's philanthropic partnerships in India include collaboration with the Arpana Charitable Trust in Haryana; the Rotary Hospital connected with the Kasturba Medical College in Manipal; the Eye Hospital in Vyara, Gujarat; eye camps in cooperation with Volunteer Eye Surgeons International; Latur Hospital Medical Center, Maharastra; B.J. Medical College, Poona, and Children's Health and Welfare 12  See also Singhvi Report, p. 484.   12 Foundation,Uttar Pradesh. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.aapiusa.org. American India Foundation (AIF): AIF was established in the wake of the devastating earthquake that struck Gujarat in January of 2001. The Mission of the organization is to accelerate socioeconomic change in India. Its founders include leading Indian-American business and community leaders--including Victor Menezes, Chairman and CEO, Citibank, and Rajat Gupta, Managing Director, McKinsey and Company--as well as former President Bill Clinton. AIF focuses its grants primarily on livelihood, education, rehabilitation, and health and human services. AIF focused its activities in 2001 on rebuilding and rehabilitating Gujarat. To this end, AIF raised $4.7 million for these efforts and has supported 19 NGOs working in Gujarat. It has funded activities including the construction of over 1,900 homes, the regeneration of livelihood for roughly 2,000 artisans, the construction of schools serving over 6,000 students, and the construction of five hospitals. With the remaining $1 million dollars AIF has earmarked for Gujarat, it will fund the longer-term needs of villages throughout the state. Projects under consideration largely fall within AIF's focus areas of Education and Livelihood. Though AIF is primarily focused on its grant-making activities in India, the foundation has also launched the Service Corps fellowship that sends qualified and skilled individuals to India for 9 months of volunteer development work. The Foundation's offices are located in New York, California and India. To organization's website can be viewed at: www.aifoundation.org. Asha for Education: Asha for Education is an organization dedicated to support basic education in India. Asha has its origins in the University of California, Berkeley in 1991. Over the years, it has grown rapidly in size, with 35 chapters in different campuses in the US, 7 in India, and 3 international chapters in London, Zurich and Melbourne. The organization is entirely run through the efforts of some 1000 volunteers. Each of these chapters raises funds to support various education-related projects in India. Till date, Asha has supported more than 600 different projects spanning about 20 states of India. In terms of project funding, more than $2,000,000 has been disbursed to these projects since Asha's inception. In 2001 alone, Asha chapters raised $1,000,000 and disbursed close to $850K to over 152 projects. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.ashanet.org. Association for India's Development (AID): AID was started in 1991 in the University of Maryland's College Park campus by a few visionary students who had a desire to promote social activity in India. The organization is registered as a 501 (C)(3) nonprofit charitable association, has 36 chapters throughout the US, and is entirely run by volunteers. AID supports a wide variety of development projects focused on the poor and underprivileged in India. It identifies development projects in India that require initial funding to get started and are likely to sustain themselves with local efforts beyond the starting point. Projects are closely monitored for proper utilization of the funds through volunteers based both in the US as well as in India. What started off as a $200 project at a student's apartment has today grown into more than a $100,000 per annum organization. Today, AID supports more than 25 projects in 14 states around India, reaching out to more than 15,000 people--from Swanirwar, a healthcare revolution in West Bengal to Sparsh, AIDS-awareness camps for truck drivers in Lucknow; from Busgaon Rural Development Project in Rajasthan to Karunai Illam, an orphanage in Tamil Nadu; from the Grameen Bank in Kerala to a Cloth Weaving Centre for destitute women in Assam and a candle-making cottage industry for women in Maharashtra.   13 Recently, AID has launched an ambitious hundred-block plan to implement its projects. In 100 districts each, AID chooses one block (the one with the most motivated set of volunteers) and in this block plans to develop a number of programs over the next 5-7 years. These programs focus on health, children's education, women's empowerment, savings and credit, adult continuing education and libraries, computer and vocational education centers, agriculture and enterprises, etc. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.aidindia.org. Rejuvenate India Movement (RIM): RIM is a network of organizations and individuals working together for India's development. The goal of the movement is to catalyze a mass movement to strengthen democratic processes toward self-reliant development. RIM sponsors volunteers who work full-time in a village to respond to development needs of the villagers. The volunteers are selected and trained by coordinating NGOs, and work under their close supervision. Through its activities, RIM is having an impact on the lives of 30,000 people in 100 villages in 11 states, through 57 sponsored volunteers and 25 partner NGOs. The movement's website can be viewed at: www.indiamovement.org. The impact of private sector collaborative ventures: The presence of Indian Americans in the US has opened up many business opportunities for Indian companies. The information technology sector in India has recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 55% between 1992  2001. IT professionals in the US relied heavily on the large pool of skilled computer professionals in India to subcontract work to, thus creating ""several virtual cycles for the Indian IT sector and economy."" (Singhvi, 175). The success of Indian Americans in the US has drawn the attention of several multinational companies (MNCs) to India. To illustrate the point, a large number of MNCs have established research and development centers in India. These include General Electric, CISCO Systems, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, IBM, Huges Software, Lucent Technologies, Texas Instruments, Oracle, and Intel. The development impact of these ventures--whether individual or institutional  while not quantifiable, is growing in significance as more and more entities begin to contribute their time and money to development initiatives in India.  Identify any particular factors, peculiar to these collaborative ventures, which tend to make them more or less successful. Technology: Technology is a main driver in the Indo-US partnership process, especially for the current generation of technology savvy entrepreneurs (Taplin,13). There are several websites in existence that provide excellent information that cuts across traditional, geographic and cultural barriers. These include Asha (www.ashanet.org), Child Relief and You (www.us.cry.org); indianngos.com; serveindiaforum.net, and the Rejuvenate India Movement (www.indiamovement.org) (Taplin, 14).   14 Long-term horizon: Organizations like AID and Asha in particular listed several factors that ""Working with a group on a long term basis have contributed to the success of their allows us more flexibility in doing high-quality projects and also in implementing long-term partnerships. These organizations take a long ideas and solutions. Developing long-term term view of their development activities.

Therefore, in establishing relationships with - Quote from AID website, www.aidindia.org NGOs, they seek to develop long term relationships with a limited number of selected organizations. One established, it is easier for them to expand existing activities, rather than searching for new groups with whom to do projects. If a project is working well, the preference of the organization is to expand that activity rather than scatter resources across larger numbers of new projects. Partner selection: These groups give a tremendous amount of importance to the process of partner selection. This is especially important if they are to work with them on a long term basis. Volunteers are given a strict set of due diligence criteria that must be fulfilled before a decision is made to fund a project. In the case of AID, it is mandatory to conduct an in-country site visit before the initiation of project funding. Community Involvement: Another factor contributing to the success of these ventures is ""community buy-in"" and involvement in the project. AID has observed that this is critically important in determining the sustainability of a project. In this regard, to the extent possible, it is helpful to have staff drawn from the local community. Close involvement with the project: Close engagement between the funding organization and the grantee is another factor determining success of a partnership. AID and Asha encourage individual volunteers to take ownership of a project and then monitor it over time for progress. Volunteers who might be visiting India are encouraged to make a site visit to check on project progress as well. Some volunteers from these organizations have elected to donate their time on a full time basis to their collaborating partners through spending an extended period of time working with the organization hands-on at the grassroots level. As impact assessments of recently launched collaborative ventures are carried out, additional factors that make collaborative ventures successful will certainly emerge.  Generate and provide historical, quantitative, information which can be used as baseline measures to monitor changes in scope, scale and quality of these ventures over time as a result of Facility activities. Measuring Progress: Some Suggested Indicators This section proposes indicators that are practical and can be utilized by the Facility to measure changes in the quantity and quality of partnership ventures over time. These indicators reflect the objectives and purposes of the Facility, and are structured according to a development approach that emphasizes 3 core aspects:   15 To increase outreach and reach large numbers of people through the development of vibrant partnerships; To have a positive impact on client partners; To support cost-effective partnership arrangements.13 The following table provides a description of the indicators, what they attempt to measure (the objective), and where the information can be accessed from (the source). Indicator Outreach 1. Total amount of foreign contributions received from the US. The flow of funds from the US is an indicator of increased levels of partnership between US and Indian entities. In 20002001, it is estimated that foreign contributions received from the US amounted to $298.5 million for development activities in India (Accountable Handbook, 7). This data could be tracked over time to gauge the increasing or decreasing scale and quantity of Indo-US partnerships. At the institutional level, tracking the average amount of funds received could indicate the increasing or decreasing scale of partnership relations. In 1999/2000, the average funds received per organization amounted to 28.1 lakhs, which is an increase of 9% year per year per NGO since 1992, when the average NGO received 15.5 lakhs (Accountable Handbook, 4). This indicator can be tracked to analyze the spatial distribution of funding received, its spread and concentration. Tracking this indicator would be a useful way of tracking geographical disparities in assistance. Partnership initiatives could then be focused on responding to areas that indicate a deficit of funding relative to their development needs. Tracking this information is useful since it indicates focus areas being targeted by donors and/or NGOs. The extent of activity in each sector would be useful to look at in order to get a sense of where contributions in the future should go. Data on contributions received from the US is available from the FCRA Department, Ministry of Home Affairs. This information is compiled by the FCRA Department and drawn from Form FC-3 (Account for Foreign Contributions) that NGOs and charitable organizations receiving foreign contributions are required to fill out on an annual basis. The form requires organizations to disaggregate financial contributions by country as well as by donor. FCRA Department, Ministry of Home Affairs Objective Source  2.

Impact 1 ""Repeat customers"" (percentage of partners who access the Facility more than once), and reasons for satisfaction and repeat access. Percentage of partners who experienced institutional benefits. Tracking the number of repeat customers, as well as the reasons that they return to the Facility to access services, could be one way to measure the organization's impact. This information would need to be tracked by the staff of the Facility. Information on reasons that partners return to the Facility would have to be collected by conducting interviews with partner organizations. Information on the benefits of the Facility's services could be gained from speaking with partner organizations. This information could be used to substantiate ""repeat customer"" information of a quantitative nature.

Ratio of actual projects implemented to total MOUs signed.  This information would need to be tracked by the staff of the Facility through periodic visits to the organization to see how the partnerships evolve and what form they take. This information would be tracked on an institution-by- institution basis and could be drawn from reports generated by the partnership ventures themselves.  4  The actual percentage of MOUs being translated into projects is a reflection of the actual compatibility of needs, vision, and capabilities of the partnering organizations, and therefore the success of current partnership arrangements. The Facility's goal would be to work to increase this ratio. The quality and impact of the partnership services and linkages being formed can be measured by tracking the forms of resource transfers taking place between partnering organizations. A resource exchange might take the form of an in-kind exchange, a matching grant or an outright grant. This information would provide an indication of the nature of partnerships being formed and partner preferences, if any, and thereby provide insight in terms of what kind of partnerships the Facility should emphasize or de-emphasize in the future. This is an important indicator to track for an organization that has concerns about functioning in a cost effective manner. This indicator is important, especially from a donor's point of view. A donor wants to see that the bulk of the contributions are being directed at projects.  5  Type of partnership formed.

The Indian diaspora has grown in numbers and significance, particularly over the past decade, and positioned itself to play an important role in promoting partnerships between philanthropic institutions in the US and development organizations in India. With an average per capita income of $60,093, Indians are the wealthiest ethnic community in the United States. There are an estimated 1.68 million Indian Americans in the US today, and the majority of them are based in California (approximately 32%) and New York (approximately 25%). The majority of Indian Americans trace their roots to 8 Indian states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab and Gujarat. This large immigrant population is characterized by a relatively high level of education, with two of every three Indian immigrants holding an advanced degree. Unlike their predecessors that were largely engaged in agriculture, Indian Americans today are engaged in a variety of professional specialty occupations, live in urban areas in various East and West Coast locations, and have, through their hard work, ascended to the top-most ranks of their fields. Foreign contributions into India from the US - both financial and nonfinancial--have been steadily growing at an annual average growth rate of 27% since 1998. In 20002001, India received a total of Rs. 4523.23 crores (US$ 904.6 million) in foreign contributions. The US contribution to this figure is the largest, amounting to Rs.1492.62 crores (US$ 298.5 million) or 33% of total funding. There is also a growing trend of volunteerism that helps build a deeper connection to the motherland. Increasing numbers of Indian Americans are keen on contributing their skills and human resources for benefit to India. Students seeking to do internships, physicians seeking to contribute their medical skills, and successful business executives seeking to assist innovative ""social entrepreneurs"" represent such constituencies. Our research revealed that education is a key area of emphasis by the diaspora. This is due to the fact that education is perceived as a high leverage sector that is critical to the future progress of India. Other sectors that are regarded as important by Indian Americans include technology promotion (also regarded as a high leverage sector), women's empowerment, primary health, family planning, infrastructure development, poverty programs, and the environment. The major states that receive foreign contributions (aggregate US and non US) include Delhi, and the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Maharashtra is also significant in this regard. Recent figures provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs indicate that in 2001-2002, Delhi reported the largest amount of foreign contributions (Rs. 763.05 crores or $152.6 million) followed by Tamil Nadu (Rs. 649.45 crores or $129.9 million) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs. 589.52 crores or $117.9 million).   18 The aggregate development impact of Indo-US ventures  whether individual or institutional  while difficult to quantify, is growing in significance as more and more entities begin to contribute their time and money to development initiatives in India. Factors critical to the success of these ventures include access and use of technology; establishing a relationship with a long time horizon; careful partner selection; community involvement, and close involvement between grantor and grantee over the life of the project. Finally, this section has proposed indicators that can be utilized by the Facility to measure changes in the quantity and quality of partnership ventures over time. These indicators are structured according to a development approach that emphasizes 3 core aspects: to increase outreach and reach large numbers of people through the development of vibrant partnerships; to have a positive impact on client partners; and to support cost-effective partnership arrangements. A detailed description of these indicators is provided in the main body of the report.   19 -- Chapter 2 -- CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS  Assess the principal constraints as articulated by current or potential venture participants. The principal constraints to partnership formation between US and Indian organizations are as follows: 1. Distrust of US funding institutions by Indian NGOs and a consequent hesitance to partner with them; 2. Limited (Indian) NGO capacity and associated problems of credibility emanating from a lack of organizational transparency and accountability; 3. Lack of information and institutional knowledge on partnership opportunities; 4. Perceptions of India as an overregulated, large, diverse, corrupt and complex environment that is difficult to fully comprehend and operate in; 5. Inadequate resources, especially among smaller NGOs, for partnership exploration costs; 6. Perception of FCRA procedures as being designed to control and make difficult the funding of Indian development programs by foreign organizations; 7. USAID rules and regulations and associated reporting requirements that have the potential to create a heavy-handed environment that impedes the natural formation of alliances; 8. New US federal government regulations aimed at thwarting the laundering of money through charities for terrorist organizations that could have a negative impact on US giving for foreign, including Indian, NGOs. Trust and Credibility Issues Related to US Funding Institutions One impediment to partnership formation between US and Indian organizations is the lack of credibility that some US funding agencies primarily those identified as having a close linkage to US government sources of support have in India. Foreign aid received from the US is believed to be highly politicized. Stakeholders cited USAID's change in aid focus post the 1998 nuclear tests as one example of a changing agenda that is too quick to respond to political interests, rather than to India's development priorities and objectives. In addition, the Asia Foundation and US Peace Corps were explicitly mentioned as examples of development initiatives with political rather than development objectives. By in large, European donors seem to be regarded as benign and reliable partners; US development programs, especially those affiliated in some way with the US government, are looked at with a degree of skepticism, due to the inevitable implication of a ""hidden agenda."" ""To be a ""quality funder,"" you should set up your institution so that it is relatively autonomous and independent of the larger agenda of governments involved. In India today, the quality of funding received form European donors and the Ford Foundation is good; in the case of ""others,"" it is not. European donors understand development and are considered quality funders because they engage with partner organizations on the basis of trust and equality, and are not patronizing. Furthermore, they work to establish a long-term association with recipient organizations through sticking with a development problem over a period of time. You need to be trusting of partner organizations and their abilities when soliciting their partnership for development activities."" -- Mr. Ajay Mehta, Executive Director, National Foundation of India.   20  A related theme that emerged during stakeholder ""Your proposed Indo-US Facility should discussions is a concern among many in the venture very carefully and not become Indian NGO community over inequality in the another US Peace Corp experience in India."" power balance of a partnership relationship with a - Mr. V. Rangaraj, Vice President, Indo US US institution. Participants of the Mumbai Chamber of Commerce, Mumbai stakeholder session underscored the need to articulate equality as a core principle underlying the proposed institution. The Facility can operationalize this principle through maintaining an autonomous, neutral stance, and selecting partners based on an unbiased set of criteria that determines their appropriateness for partnership activities. Limited Capacity and Credibility of Indian NGOs The public perception of the voluntary sector ""The NGO movement today is not accountable to in India is characterized a degree of anyone in India.

Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Mrs. Menaka Gandhi, criticized the handling - Mr. Sanjay Aggarwal, Head, AccountAid India of finances by several Indian NGOs, pointing to instances of corruption and leakage of funds. She also touched on the topic of NGOs floated by former Indian bureaucrats on questionable grounds. This, she observed, is becoming a flourishing practice supported by political leaders and needs to be curbed. These and related observations have been well documented in studies on the NGO sector in India, such as The Non Profit Sector in India, published by CAF, that provides an overview of the sector and key challenges and difficulties that it currently faces. In the case of smaller NGOs in particular, a lack of capacity to effectively utilize resources and document activities contributes to perpetuating a questionable public image. For example, in a study of annual reporting of voluntary agencies in India entitled Building Credibility, the author noted the poor quality of information reported by voluntary organizations in their annual reports. This poor quality contributes to public skepticism, and a lack of visibility of the sector in the eyes of the public at large (MCAS, 2). The lack of expertise especially in smaller Indian NGOs often contributes to their inability to meet the requirements of specific grant opportunities and associated rules relating to preparation of project proposals, statements of accounts, progress reports, etc (CAF, 46). Bolstering the capacity of these organizations is therefore critical for enhancing their organizational effectiveness as well as their credibility in the eyes of potential partners.   21  Inadequate Information on Partnership Opportunities A critical factor in the establishment of any alliance is knowledge and information about the prospective partner. The search for a partner is greatly facilitated by the availability of descriptive material that describes factors such as institutional purpose, capability, unique style and approach. A frequently cited problem in our ""What is it that you mean when you use the word discussions with Facility stakeholders ""partnership""? Where does the partnership begin, relates to the fact that there is an and where does it end? Partnerships today are inadequate databank of information on primarily money-driven relationships between donor organizations in the US and India for use and donee. How will your proposed Facility work to in identifying potential partners, and structure partnerships that go beyond this to bring providing pointers on partnership together partners on an equal footing?"" formation and management. Basic factual information on organizations is accessible - Participant, Stakeholder Sessions, Hyderabad. through the internet and is valuable (see, for example, the website managed by indianngos.com). However, this alone is seldom sufficient to ensure a durable relationship. More subtle and nuanced knowledge about the prospective partner is also critically important. Strong partnerships often take years to develop as the entities work together and gradually become familiar with the operations, systems and strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues. Studies have repeatedly shown that the fundamental impediment that lies at the root of failed commercial partnerships is a disconnect between core organizational values and that these core principles were not adequately understood or appreciated at the onset of the relationship. This is a doubly important factor among NGO entities where matters of mission and social principle substitute for profit as the driving force of organizational purpose. Inadequate information exchange is also a result of a dearth of forums to allow this exchange to take place. In the commercial sector, firms that wish to enter into alliance relations can draw upon the assistance of established organizations to conduct due diligence audits, work through stock mergers, integrate systems and design compatible organizational structures. The availability of these services removes many of the procedural impediments and establish a transparent information base upon which discussions, negotiations, and consensual agreements can be established. In general, this capability is far less established in the development sector due in part to the scarcity of resources and because mergers and partnerships are relatively less frequent. It is limited in developing countries and particularly scarce in situations involving crossborder relations. In the US, private foundations facilitate linkages by funding innovative cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary connections, professional associations and advocacy groups that provide a supportive venue where like minded organizations can meet and collaborate. The complex associational life of a strong nongovernmental sector is less evident in societies that have not had the time to establish the institutional infrastructure that promotes, facilitates, and subsidizes networking for its inherent value. While this is emerging in India, much can be done to accelerate the process and at the same time encourage linkages that go beyond the domestic perimeter.   22 Perceptions of India Discussions with US stakeholders revealed that a perception exists of India as being a large and complex place that presents great difficulty in sorting through an infinite maze of potential associations in order to identify partners and establish operations. As reported in the Singhvi report, negative experiences (such as dealing with immigration and customs officials at airports) has led to a perception that corruption is pervasive and unchecked in India. This has had a major impact on perceptions of India by Indian Americans, and as they contrast life in the US and India, they conclude that there has to be a change in terms of enforcing the right kinds of norms and values, particularly as these relate to the work ethic of the lower levels of Indian bureaucracy with which they are forced to deal with. Concern regarding Government of India (GOI) involvement in the Facility as a potential constraint to partnership formation was a recurring theme that was expressed by stakeholders. Stakeholder cautioned that it would be necessary to maintain a relationship with the Indian government, however, the GOI should not be engaged in the direct operations of the Facility. Even if the bureaucratic and procedural delays were fully overcome, the flavor of official involvement is clearly distasteful to prospective participants. Inadequate Resources for Partnership Exploration Indian and US NGOs seldom have the resources to invest in partnership exploration or to invest in experimental activities with other organizations. These costs are significant, since they often involve travel and take scarce personnel away from their established responsibilities. Moreover, new collaborations almost always necessitate the designation of key contact points and careful assignment of responsibility to facilitate and promote the relationship within an organization. This can necessitate increased staff costs prior to the time that the partnership has demonstrated any return. There is limited donor support for the exploratory and fact-finding stage of the partnering process. In general, most donors prefer to support specific projects or programs or established relations where outcomes and results are predictable. Alternatively, they have been less willing to finance alliances that are new and untested or to support projects between entities that have not worked together in the past. This conservative bias is understandable in the context of risk management but it tends to discourage the emergence of experimental relations which have the potential for identifying fresh ideas and new approaches. Insufficient resources have also constrained Indian NGOs in terms of enabling them to effectively market themselves to prospective partners. Seen as a whole, the Indian NGO sector is not effectively marketing its capabilities to prospective collaborators. The sector is characterized by a culture of passivity in terms of aggressively seeking out collaborative partners and themselves bringing ideas to the table that can be potentially jointly explored. This observation is especially pervasive in the ""Yes, this is generally the case that only larger organizations with high profiles end up getting funds. Take Child Relief and You (CRY) for example. It has, as a strategic policy spent a lot of money on 'brand building'. That is why it is known today and gets funds rather easily. Smaller NGOs may not be in a position to spend so much money on brand building, which is why they often find it difficult to get money."" - Interview with Noshir Dadrawala, CAF, posted on Indianngos.com.   23 corporate sector, which would respond NGOs could gain greatly with increase coherent and well thought out strategy make themselves known to partners in better if NGOs could appeal to their ""bottom line."" resources aimed at helping them develop a that could help them market their wares and search of collaborative opportunities.   The analysis will identify and describe any particular US government or GOI policies, laws, regulations or practices which are perceived as key constraining factors. Indian Regulations and Reporting Requirements Most small non-profit organizations in India have only limited understanding of the registration process and obtaining the necessary clearances - such as prior permission or FCRA clearance14 - and inadequate time and resources to work through these requirements in a systematic manner. They regard the registration process as particularly problematic and complex, since there are multiple authorities to work through, all dealing with different aspects of the registration process. For example, the charity commissioner/registrar of societies is the state authority for registering an NGO as a legal entity. The federal Income Tax authority has to be approached to get tax exemptions. Following this, the organization then has to work with the Home ministry to obtain registration under the FCRA. For large and sophisticated NGOs, however, obtaining approvals under FCRA from the Ministry of Home Affairs is generally regarded more as an irritant than a constraint. Acknowledging that there are multiple registering authorities, once the basic process is over, the NGO may go ahead with its program and simply file returns once a year with these authorities. US Government Regulations The US Treasury Department has recently issued new guidelines for US-based charities to assist those charities in avoiding any ties to terrorist organizations that might lead to a blocking action. The guidelines focus on financial controls and the vetting of potential foreign recipients. They call for increased scrutiny of grantees' background and finances before a grant is made. The guidelines are likely to affect NGOs around the world, including India. US-based organizations sent Rs.1,493 crores ($ 298.6 million) to Indian non-profits in 2000-01, accounting for some 33% of the total FCRA inflows during this period. Although the guidelines are voluntary, compliance may have the inadvertent impact of reducing the chance of a charity's funds being blocked by the US Government. CARE India is of the opinion that policies and laws pertaining to development sector in India are not, in and of themselves, impediments to their program activities. Rather, it is a matter of figuring out the decision-making process within the Indian bureaucracy and complying to the letter of the rule or regulation. In CARE's opinion, complying with regulatory requirements is a time consuming activity, but not insurmountable.  14  New voluntary organizations or charitable agencies wanting to start operations in India have to apply for ""Prior Permission"". A Prior Permission is also necessary for those voluntary organizations in India that do not have registration under the FCRA, but wish to access foreign assistance.

Intrusive monitoring, heavy reporting and a high level of certification requirements may create a heavy-handed environment that is incompatible with the delicate process of partnership building. ""It is very difficult to obtain funds from USAID. It takes a long time to obtain the funds in hand. In structuring this Facility, you must clarify for us: How is this Facility going to be any different from USAID?"" - Participant, Stakeholder Meeting, Hyderabad.   Describe efforts being undertaken by other groups in the US and India to ameliorate these impeding factors. Relatively few efforts were identified that are aimed specifically at addressing one or more of the constraints in the above list. Some noteworthy examples are described below. 1) AccountAid India is a private consulting organization based in New Delhi that works with NGOs on accounting, financial management and legal issues. Its areas of focus include compliance with FCRA, accounting structure, income tax, Societies Act, budgeting, and donor reporting. AccountAid implements its activities through a number of different mechanisms, including conducting training workshops, publishing an annual Accountable Handbook as well as a monthly Accountable circular that is available through email, and disseminating information through its website. This website provides FCRA forms, and also provides an online email answering service that allows NGOs to ask and obtain information and guidance on issues in confidence on a complimentary basis. AccountAid is a member of the Task Force set up by the Planning Commission on Laws affecting the Voluntary Sector. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.accountaid.net. 2) Catalyst Social Development Consultants Private Limited: Catalyst is a social development consulting firm that aims to broker relationships between private enterprise, foundations and individuals in the United States and the non-profit sector in India. This Gurgaon, Haryana-based organization seeks to:  Build awareness about the voluntary sector;  Mobilise funds for the Indian development sector; and  Facilitate the setting up of collaborative ventures. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.catalystindia.net. 3) Center for Advancement of Philanthropy: Established in 1986, the Mumbai-based Center for Advancement of Philanthropy provides advice and assistance to a variety of Indian philanthropic organizations (including foundations, trusts, voluntary agencies, companies with philanthropic objectives, advocacy groups, and associations) in the areas of law, taxation, investment of funds, financial planning, human resource development, and effective management. The Centre has on its board of management a wide range of resource persons (including a retired charity commissioner, a retired income tax commissioner, and financial consultants) whose expertise it regularly draws upon to fulfill its activities. The Centre currently has a membership strength of about 400, comprising a fairly representative cross section of corporate bodies, grant-making   25 foundations, NGOs and professionals involved in the field of philanthropy. It has also published resource materials aimed at bolstering the institutional capacity of NGOs. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.cozucare.org/cap/index.htm. 4) Charities Aid Foundation  India: Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) International, of which Delhi-based CAF India is a part, is a network of NGOs dedicated to supporting and strengthening voluntary giving and non-profit enterprise across the world. In 2000, CAF India published an analytical description of the voluntary sector in India, including an information database of 2,350 NGOs. CAF India has pioneered corporate community initiatives with several companies in India. It also is opening up new resources for NGOs by working with chambers of commerce, such as the Confederation of Indian Industry. CAF provides advice to NGOs in the following areas:  Options for setting up an organization in India to promote a charitable cause;  Tax relief;  Legal considerations in giving from overseas;  Contacts and partnership prospects. In addition, it provides funding to Indian NGO partners after they have been subjected to due diligence validation. The organization recently carried out due diligence checks on about 1,500 NGOs in India. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.cafonline.org/cafindia. 5) Credibility Alliance: The Credibility Alliance is a loose network of organizations in India that share a concern to promote good governance and practices that will enhance the credibility of the voluntary sector in India. The goal of the Alliance is to establish from within the sector norms that will strengthen and enhance the credibility of the voluntary sector to outsiders. Specifically, the Alliance is aimed at helping NGOs improve their vision statements, operations, governance, transparency and accountability. Compliance with the norms is voluntary because the principle is one of self-regulation. A central goal of the Alliance is the establishment of an accreditation agency that would certify an organization as having complied with the minimum norms. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.credibilityalliance.org. 6) The Development Marketplace: Run out of the World Bank in Washington DC, Development Marketplace (DM) is a program that promotes innovative development ideas through early stage seed funding. The organization links social entrepreneurs with poverty fighting ideas to partners with resources to help implement their vision. Every 18-24 months, it hosts a global competition for innovative development ideas. The proposals compete for financial support and/or technical assistance provided by DM's sponsors. The competition is open to individuals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic organizations, faith-based groups, local government, local government, private sector companies, official aid agencies, and grass roots organizations. In addition, DM hosts Country Innovation Days (CIDs) that allow very small, locallybased projects to compete for support. Held at the national or regional level, CIDs are dedicated to identifying and supporting innovative development ideas and building synergies among local and regional social entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs compete at the local level for start-up funds for ideas that bring people and institutions together, and have the greatest scale-up potential. In addition, DM hosts knowledge forums for various   26 leaders in the development community that provides a platform for them to share their experiences and information around pre-selected themes that are of local and global interest in development. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.developmentmarketplace.org. 7) Give Foundation: The Give Foundation, set up in collaboration with ICICI, offers a variety of capacity building services to nonprofit organizations including assistance with donor reporting requirements, transparency and accountability-related areas, particularly accounting in management information systems. The Foundation offers project / NGO identification, appraisal, monitoring, evaluation and Charity Portfolio Management services to corporates, institutional donors and grant-making institutions. Specific services offered to NGOs include:  Needs assessments, accounting and MIS system design;  System implementation, including design of documents and internal control systems;  Cash flow planning and funds management. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.givefoundation.org. 8) Government of India: In the context of the formulation of the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007), the GOI set up a steering committee for the active involvement of the voluntary sector in the development process. The committee is comprised of 40 members from the government and voluntary sector. Its terms of reference are:  To review the policies, procedures, and guidelines of the government and other organizations for involving voluntary organizations in different programs and to recommend alternative policies and simplified procedures for involvement of the voluntary sector;  To review the existing programs for capacity building of the voluntary sector and suggest measures to make NGOs more effective for good governance, service delivery and managing development resources;  To examine the existing partnership arrangements between the voluntary sector and the private sector and municipalities and recommend appropriate steps to facilitate and enhance such partnerships. No recommendations have as yet emerged from the Planning Commission undertaking. 9) Indev is the British Council's initiative to address problems faced by development managers in accessing development information on India. Indev holds and disseminates information for decision-makers, researchers, academics and development managers, and serves to act as a gateway to development information on India. Indev has links to over 2500 leading development organizations in India. Indev's partners that include bilateral agencies, government departments and leading NGOs, make the web site a 'One-stop shop' for development information on India. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.indev.nic.in. 10) IndianNGOs.com: This site, comprising some 25,000 pages of text, is dedicated to building the capacities of NGOs, the donor community, corporates, development professionals and interested individuals in through providing an expansive databank of information, program information, profiles, news, statistics and development related research. The organization's website can be viewed at: IndianNGOs.com. 11) Sampradaan Indian Centre for Philanthropy (SICP): Founded in 1996, SICP is a Delhi-based non-profit organization that aims to promote and strengthen philanthropy in   27 India. The need for the organization was first articulated at a workshop held in New Delhi in 1995 which noted that despite a long tradition of philanthropy in India, there was a disproportionately low contribution to organized charity due to a lack of public awareness and information, professional advice and support, and the absence of a national forum for interaction between those engaged in philanthropic activities. The organization was formed to respond to this need, and works to create an enabling environment conducive to philanthropy by increasing awareness and appreciation of its role by people, corporations and the state. Its goal is to promote a professional approach to giving that is focused on the efficient utilization of charitable resources. SICP achieves these objectives through research, information dissemination, workshops and conferences, advocacy, public education, and promotional campaigns. SICP has published a series of useful information sheets on ""Law and Non-Profit Organizations"" in response to requests for advice from the development sector for information on setting up a trust, a society, or a non-profit company, reporting requirements of NGOs, and rules and regulations applicable to NGOs. SICP has also published the first-ever national directory of Indian Donor Organizations. The directory is the only database of Indian donor organizations, and enables fund seekers to find matching donor organizations. 'Sampradaan', SICP's bimonthly newsletter, keeps readers updated on happenings in the philanthropy movement in India and abroad. By increasing public knowledge of Indian philanthropy and its strengths, limitations and potential, the program motivates individuals, organizations and corporations to contribute to philanthropic initiatives. It also provides a forum to readers to share experiences and raise concerns. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.sampradaan.org. 12) Society for Participatory Research in Asia (PRIA): PRIA is a Delhi-based organization that describes itself as ""an international center for learning and promotion of participation and democratic governance."" Its core activities include:  Capacity building services to civil society organizations;  Policy advocacy through promotion of policies that create an enabling environment for the development sector;  Knowledge-building aimed at conducting research on issues and institutions which enable or disable citizen participation in democratic processes. Recognizing the paucity of good information that documented the scale and size of the nonprofit sector in India, in 1998, PRIA undertook a survey in conjunction with USbased John Hopkins University that as published in 2003. The survey, entitled Invisible Yet Widespread: The Nonprofit Sector in India, covers the five states of Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya and provides data on Indian nonprofit sector scale in terms of number of organizations, regional differences, extent and sources of funding, number of employees, and government policy impact. The organization's website can be viewed at: www.pria.org. 13) The Association for Third Sector Research in India (ATRI) is an association of researchers and individuals interested in research on the voluntary sector in general and the Indian voluntary sector in particular. Launched in January 2000, this association emerged out of the felt need to systematically document various types of research on the voluntary sector. It aims to serve as an information gateway and a forum for effective   28 linkages with regard to all aspects of Third Sector research. The organization provides a forum for researchers from various institutions and universities to share research on the voluntary sector, and makes its research available on its website: www.ngoresearch.org.  Identify steps that could be taken to ameliorate these principal constraints and identify those that may be appropriate for USAID: There is tremendous opportunity for USAID to engage itself in ameliorating the constraints identified in this analysis. These include the following: 1) Constraint: Perception that US policy government involvement will undermine the credibility of the proposed Facility through the inevitable implication of a ""hidden agenda."" Possible USAID Action: USAID should maintain a low profile in terms of its association with the Facility. The Facility should develop an autonomous and independent identity. Furthermore, in order to gain credibility and acceptability in the eyes of Indian stakeholders, the entity should be registered as an Indian organization that has its headquarters in India, and whose board is majority Indian. 2) Constraint: Belief in the US that many Indian organizations, especially NGOs, lack capacity to implement partnership programs and adequately account for funds. Possible USAID Action: Help US organizations identify Indian partners that have been screened for due diligence and provide capacity building assistance to partner agencies to overcome identified deficiencies. 3) Constraint: Inadequate databases of information on organizations in the US and India for use in identifying potential partners. Possible USAID Action: Build institutional data bases and disseminate information through the internet and workshops that bring partners together. Conduct studies and analyses to identify areas of potential collaboration and high payoff. 4) Constraint: Perception in the US that the complex network of Indian regulatory requirements makes doing business in India costly and time consuming. Possible USAID Action: Provide information and guidance to US organizations on how to deal with Indian rules and regulations governing financial relationships between Indian and foreign entities. 5) Constraint: Perception in some quarters in the US that corruption in India is pervasive and unchecked. Possible USAID Action: Help educate potential US partners on the realities of doing business in India, including providing educational tools and guidance on how to get things done in India. 6) Constraint: Lack of availability of resources, especially among smaller NGOs, for partnership exploration costs ( face-to-face interviews and interpersonal information exchange).   29  Possible USAID Action: Provide small facilitative grants aimed at helping small and fledgling organizations in India and the US overcome the initial financial hurdles of making contacts and building relationships. 7) Constraint: Perception in India and the US that FCRA procedures are designed to control and make difficult the funding of Indian development programs by foreign organizations. Possible USAID Action: Help entities in India and the US that are exploring partnership collaboration to understand what the FCRA rules are and how to comply with them. Provide a short list of accountancy firms that specialize in helping NGOs complete the necessary paperwork and provide guidance in working with the government entities involved in providing FCRA approval. 8) Constraint: Concern among many in the Indian NGO community over inequality in the power balance of a partnership relationship with a US institution. Possible USAID Action: Conduct outreach programs, prepare pamphlets and hold workshops aimed at building a better understanding of what constitutes a partnership, what sustains a partnership, and what benefits a partner entity can expect from the relationship. The goal will be to get participating entities to recognize that successful partnerships can be built between unequal organizations as long as each party receives back from the partnership more than it contributed. 9) Constraint: New US federal government regulations aimed at thwarting the laundering of money through charities for terrorist organizations will have a negative on US giving for foreign - including Indian - NGOs. Possible USAID Action: USAID should ensure wide distribution of the US Treasury Department Anti-Terrorist Financing Guidelines Voluntary Best Practices for U.S. Based Charities.

Distrust of US funding institutions by Indian NGOs and a consequent hesitance to partner with them; 2. Limited (Indian) NGO capacity and associated problems of credibility emanating from a lack of organizational transparency and accountability; 3. Lack of information and institutional knowledge on partnership opportunities; 4. Perceptions of India as an overregulated, large, diverse, corrupt and complex environment that is difficult to fully comprehend and operate in; 5. Inadequate resources, especially among smaller NGOs, for partnership exploration costs; 6. Perception of FCRA procedures as being designed to control and make difficult the funding of Indian development programs by foreign organizations; 7. USAID rules and regulations and associated reporting requirements that have the potential to create a heavy-handed environment that impedes the natural formation of alliances; 8. New US federal government regulations aimed at thwarting the laundering of money through charities for terrorist organizations that could have a negative impact on US giving for foreign, including Indian, NGOs. Noteworthy organizations that are currently working to address these constraints include AccountAid India, Catalyst Social Change Development Consultants Private Limited, Center for Advancement of Philanthropy, Charities Aid Foundation  India, Credibility Alliance, The Development Marketplace, Give Foundation, Government of India, Indev, IndianNGOs.com, Sampradaan Indian Center for Philanthropy, Society for Participatory Research in Asia, The Association for Third Sector Research in India. Descriptions of each have been provided in the main report. USAID can take several steps to engage itself in addressing these constraints. Specifically, it should:        Maintain a low profile in terms of its association with the Facility; Facilitate the provision of capacity building assistance to Indian NGOs; Facilitate the building of a database and conduct studies and analyses to identify areas of potential collaboration and high payoff; Provide guidance to US organizations on how deal with Indian rules and regulations; Provide facilitative grants aimed at helping small and fledgling organizations in India and the US to overcome the initial financial hurdles of building relationships; Conduct outreach programs and hold workshops aimed at building a better understanding of what constitutes a partnership; and Ensure wide distribution of the US Treasury Department Anti Terrorist Financing Guidelines: Voluntary Practices for US-based charities.   31 -- Chapter 3 -- PARTICIPATION ANALYSIS  Analyze which types of institutions would be most interested in assisting in designing or participating in Facility's activities, and which sort of services they would like to see the Facility undertake and why. There are two broad categories of entities that will be interested in the work of the Facility:  Funding organizations (and individuals) that are interested in providing resources for development work in India and that have a particular interest in fostering cross-border collaboration. This category will include US and Indian foundations, US and Indian companies, some of the larger American nonprofit social purpose organizations and individuals from the Indian American community. Prospective partner organizations that will constitute the client base for the work of the Facility. This category includes a long list of different types of groups, many currently involved in development work together with some with a predominantly domestic focus that have a skill or technology that has potential relevance for India's development. This category will include: educational institutions, professional associations, advocacy groups, policy research organizations, scientific research organizations, community based organizations, private voluntary development organizations and international humanitarian groups. For analytical purposes it is possible to divide this large category into several sub-categories of partnerships types: New partnerships vs. existing partnerships. Partnerships with a US entity that has prior Indian experience versus partnerships with an entity with no prior experience. Partnerships between two organizations that work in the broad area of economic and social development versus partnerships between organizations that do not traditionally work in this area e.g. scientific groups or trade associations. Partnerships that involve cross-sectoral relationship versus partnerships within the same sector. Partnerships that involve cross-organizational relationship versus partnerships within the same organizational domain e.g. professional associations working together on the one hand and a scientific group partnering with an advocacy group on the other. The durability and success of a partnership will depend on a long term mutual consensus that institutional benefits exceed institutional costs. A number of studies indicate that the likelihood that this will happen depends on the following key factors:     32  Similarity of organizational function. For example, the possibility of a strong relationship between two educational institutions is stronger than between an educational institution and a professional association. Complementarity of organizational purpose. For example, the work of a policy research group may be quite different than the work of a rural development group but a unity of purpose such as more rational agricultural pricing can bring them together. Overlap of program priorities. For example, private foundations that establish program priorities may be eager to work closely with policy research groups that can help them formulate and promote these strategies. A perception of synergy. For example, a scientific research organization may be interested in working with an advocacy organization that can translate and mainstream research findings into a practical program of action. Achievement of a specific objective. For example, a corporation may want to partner with a scientific organization because of interest in a particular line of research that the organization is carrying out. Growth in size. Organizations may have an incentive to partner simply in order to increase their size and influence. For example, an American professional association may wish to partner with another professional association in order to increase the overall size of a global entity.            In addition, partnership formation will be heavily influenced by the nature and degree of the constraints identified in Chapter 2. The most important of these include the cost of partnership identification and establishment and the existence of information regarding the existence and interest of prospective collaborators. Thus, while market forces may tend to promote certain types of partnerships because the information is available and the transaction cost is modest, the existence of an entity like the Facility can offset this incentive structure and promote relations of a unique and unusual nature that might not otherwise occur. On the basis of these observations and from anecdotal feedback from interviews and focus group sessions, the following types of partnership relations are most likely to develop as a consequence of Facility work:  Partnerships between American private voluntary development organizations (PVOs) and Indian NGOs. Although a baseline study has not been conducted, the level of American PVO activity in India appears to be relatively low in comparison to need and potential for the reasons identified in the Constraints Analysis. These groups tend to have similar purposes, functions and program priorities and face constraints of cost and access to reliable information regarding partnership opportunities. Partnerships between American advocacy groups and Indian NGOs and advocacy groups. Particularly in the area of environment, education and health, there are strong opportunities to build bridges between advocacy groups where the issue cuts across national boundaries. In particular, there will be opportunities to help Indian NGOs develop their capacity to advocate for policy change or reform.     33    Partnerships between American firms operating in India and Indian development and/or humanitarian NGOs or Indian scientific research or advocacy organizations. A considerable amount of work has been done by the Global Development Alliance on the potential for collaboration between the commercial and nonprofit sectors. While these relationships are difficult to construct and may not constitute a working partnership in the traditional sense, there may be real opportunities to nurture relationships that are mutually beneficial. One area for example involves the application and/or testing of a technology or product innovation that has positive social implications with a social purpose value. (This subject is discussed at greater length below.) Partnerships between policy research groups in the United States and development and/or humanitarian NGOs in India. The United States has a vast array of organizations that conduct a variety of forms of policy analysis or research in virtually every conceivable area of public concern. The work of these organizations is focused principally on domestic US issues but there is considerable potential applicability to challenges faced in complex developing societies. One example involves the considerable work done on the effective introduction of bilingual education in schools in the American South-west. Partnerships between scientific research groups in India and/or the United States and advocacy groups in India and/or the United States. While this type of relationship may be difficult to construct, there are significant opportunities to help advocacy groups strengthen the content and effectiveness of their positions by arming them with solid scientific research. Partnerships between Indian educational institutions and American scientific research and/or advocacy groups. Although large universities will have already established international linkages in areas of mutual professional interest, there will be opportunities to establish relations between smaller schools and US groups working in a supporting area. Partnerships between professional associations in India and America.          Partnerships with Funding Organizations Participation by Indian Americans There is a commonly held view that the Indian American community, given its wealth and desire to give back to the motherland, stands ready to open its coffers in support of entities that intend to undertake good work in India. Our feedback sessions in the US indicate that this perception is not entirely accurate. The reality is that the Indian American community looks with a jaundiced eye at giving money to charitable programs unless those programs are clearly linked to solid business plans that offer good prospects for producing visible results. A second commonly held perception is that an impediment to Indian American giving to development activities in India is difficulty on the part of the Indian American community in identifying potential organizations and programs in India to support. Here again, our   34 feed back sessions led us to a different conclusion. In actual fact, Indian Americans in the US are represented by an impressive and growing array of organizations that seek to link the skills and financing of Indians in America with organizations engaged in a wide variety of charitable and development activities in India. It is unlikely, in our judgment, that the Indian American community will become significant consumers of the services offered by the proposed Facility in the near term. Another important point to bear in mind in assessing the potential of Indian American giving is that, while the Indian community in the US is generous in supporting religious and charitable causes to which individuals have personal ties in India, the community is still in the early stages of becoming comfortable with American style philanthropy that is marked by contributing to institutions (foundations, charities, NGOs, etc.) that, in turn, make the decisions on how and where to allocate resources. Participation of US Foundations and International NGOs Existing US Foundations that were interviewed including the Ford Foundation, the United States Educational Foundation of India (USEFI), and the MacArthur Foundation are already engaged in managing programs of their own and therefore will not serve as major consumers of the Facility's services. These institutions have well-established policies and procedures that are tailored to institutional goals and objectives and they did not express any interest in being involved in detailed design relating to the creation of the Facility. However, during our discussions with these institutions useful suggestions were made for the kinds of services the Facility could provide. These included:    The partnership fund should focus on alleviating poverty. Grants should be in the nature of ""topping-up"" grants and matching grants. Most donors seek to maximize their donations and topping up grants is one of the methods that can be utilized to achieve this. Information on the proposed Facility should be easily accessible so that both donors and recipients may take advantage of its services. Many givers in the US use organizations like the Council of Foundations in New York or www.guidestar.org to obtain information on NGOs and donors. The Facility could seek to become a provider of information services on NGOs and possible partners that want to collaborate in India. The Facility should concentrate on providing services to small and disadvantaged NGOs that lack the network of connections needed for partnership formation that is available to large, international NGOs. The Facility could conduct due diligence surveys for the partnerships it sponsors, thus providing Indian Americans and other donors with a level of confidence in their giving. In this regard, the Facility would complement the efforts of Indian organizations such as the Credibility Alliance, Give Foundation, and the Charities Aid Foundation.     The following are examples of US non profit organizations that have development experience relevant to Indian problems and that might benefit from the services of the proposed Facility:  Action Aid reported that they frequently receive requests from US groups that are interested in working in India and need contacts, information and seed capital to   35 initiate an exploratory process. They reported recent interest from a group in the United States that believes they have developed a successful approach to working with street children and would like to test and broaden that approach in India. International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX) is a small non-profit in San Francisco that has developed a partnering model that they have used in several countries. The organization is very interested in expanding its work in India. The program director is Indian and several NRIs serve on the board. They would like support to work with an Indian NGO, adapting and testing the model. Save the Children has developed and launched in the United States a very popular website (Youth NOISE) for teenagers that is designed to engage them in social issues and educate young people with regard to challenges they will need to address as they mature. The concept has international potential. Funds are needed to subsidize the cost of finding partners and converting the contents and style to other cultural settings. Support for an alliance between Business for Social Responsibility in San Francisco, and the Chambers of Commerce in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai to present a series of workshops on corporate responsibility and to establish an affiliate in one of these cities to provide advisory services to interested companies. A small grants program to Indian NGOs to identify and establish linkages with an American nonprofit or association. Counseling and access to an extensive date base would be necessary for this purpose.          Participation of For-profit Institutions For profit companies that were interviewed, including PepsiCo, Infrastructure Development Finance Company, and Hindustan Development Finance Corporation, did not see a role for the Facility in a business-to-business context. However, they did foresee a role for the Facility in promoting partnerships with US entities in areas that complement their business operations that required external expertise. For example, PepsiCo described the need for technical advice in watershed management so that its contract farmers could increase yields. For-profit institutions also indicated that the partnership Facility could help them obtain voluntary sector partners for their Corporate Social Responsibility programs. Increasingly, companies in India are adopting policies of corporate social responsibility, although at this point only a few of the most forward thinking companies have integrated their commitment to corporate social responsibility into their business systems. As corporate social responsibility increases, the opportunities for cross-sector collaborations with US NGOs, universities, professional organizations and other non-profit institutions should grow. Interviews with for-profit companies identified the need for enhancing the image of India in the US. The Facility could help do that and indirectly help create an enabling environment to improve for-profit partnering between the two countries. Participation of Research and Academic Institutions Organizations such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Apollo Hospitals, and the Delhi School of Economics reacted positively to the idea of the proposed Facility. Government-affiliated institutions were   36 particularly interested in having the Facility provide advice in how to deal with bureaucratic procedures that often translate into bottlenecks and delays. During US feedback sessions, the following expressions on the part of US universities in collaborations with Indians universities were identified:  The Center for Ageing and Palliative Care at the Northwestern school of Medicine has developed a hospice training program that has been used to train over 50% of the physicians in the United States. The Center believes that this model has potential application in the developing countries if it can be modified to reflect cultural constraints. The Director of the Center has expressed great interest in working in India and is seeking funds to locate and work with an Indian organization. Harvard Medical School has established a subsidiary to identify and build collaborative relations with new and existing medical schools in other countries. Harvard designs the curriculum, provides professors and guarantees academic excellence. Other medical schools are following this example.    In terms of areas of development activity that these partnerships would focus on, the feedback interviews highlighted the following areas that the Facility could concentrate its work. 1. Education, including primary education for girls, and basic computer skills for children in rural areas; 2. Women's empowerment; 3. Primary healthcare; 4. Microenterprise/SME development; 5. Capacity building for grassroots NGOs in the development sector, emphasizing project monitoring and evaluation; 6. Value added knowledge transfer and best practices; 7. Development of community organizations; 8. Promote awareness of India's development problems in the US; and 9. Environment Note: Given the controversial nature of many human rights activities, it was often cited as an area in which it would be inappropriate for the Facility to become engaged.  Describe which divisions within the Government of India and state governments would have an interest in Facility activities and would be willing to assist in the design of the Facility. Government of India participation Upon USAID/India's request, the consulting team did not make direct contact with the GOI at this early stage in the design process. Therefore, the GOI's interest in participating in the design phase of this project is undetermined. Given the strong recommendations received during the stakeholder sessions with regard to keeping GOI involvement to the minimum, we would recommend that the government not be involved in the design phase. GOI involvement in participating in partnership activities once the Facility is up and running, however, is a possibility that should be considered. In this regard, the following list provides names of divisions within the government that might participate. The list has   37 been developed based on matching the functions of the Ministries with the Facility's proposed service areas that emerged in stakeholder sessions. Government Department 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Ministry of External Affairs Ministry of Health and Family Welfare  Department of Family Welfare; National AIDS Control Organization Ministry of Home Affairs Ministry of Human Resource Development  Department of Education; Department of Women and Child Development. Ministry of Rural Development  Council for Advancement of Peoples' Action, National Institute of Rural Development. Ministry of Science and Technology - Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Ministry of Small Scale Industries and Agro and Rural Industries. Areas of potential collaboration Diaspora affairs. HIV/AIDS, reproductive health issues. Disaster management; legal and regulatory issues as they relate to NGOs. Education; women's issues. Rural development, NGO capacity building. Research and development. Micro and small enterprise development.  In terms of state government participation, the following criteria may be helpful in deciding which states to focus the Facility's outreach efforts:     Development need: The Facility could use poverty levels as an indicator of which states are in most need of development assistance and focus its efforts accordingly; Organizations present on the ground: The Facility should examine which organizations exist on the ground that demonstrate strong partnership potential; Expressed interest in cross border relations as manifest in anecdotal feedback and existing policies, laws and regulations; and Receptivity to foreign contributions: The Facility should examine which states in the past have demonstrated greater receptivity to foreign contributions as an indicator of future participation.   Assess alternative approaches that Facility could employ to engage these groups and recommend the approach felt most appropriate. The most important thing that the Facility would need to do to attract attention would be to create innovative, effective and durable partnership relations. In addition, it is important that the Facility engage in an active outreach program in order to publicize the products that it offers and generate interest among potential partnering entities. The organizational design for the Facility envisions a pro-active role for key staff that would encourage them to pursue an entrepreneurial approach to partner identification. The following is an indicative list of the types of activities that the Facility should consider in order to promote its program activities.   38          Employ staff that are trained and capable in pursuing an entrepreneurial approach to partnership formation; Undertake an active outreach effort that involves making presentations to prospective partners, visits to prominent facilitating organizations like the Council of Foundations, Interaction etc; Participate actively in conferences, seminars and workshops on key development issues relevant to India; Establish an interactive website for stakeholders to express their views on Facility design issues as part of the design process; Once the Facility is established, regularly produce a newsletter that is widely circulated across a wide spectrum of organizations; Organize ""trade fairs"" that bring together a wide spectrum of organizational types and provide a forum for them to interact; Make contributions to scholarly journals that highlight best practices in partnership formation and management; Follow-up with institutions which have generally appeared to show interest in the Facility; and Structure a Board of Directors that posses an extensive range of senior-level relationships among the types of entities likely to utilize Facility services.   39 Participation Analysis Summary This analysis analyzed two broad categories of organizations that will be interested in the work of the Facility: 1. Funding organizations (and individuals) that are interested in providing resources for development work in India and that have a particular interest in fostering cross-border collaboration. This category will include US and Indian foundations, US and Indian companies, some of the larger American nonprofit social purpose organizations and individuals from the Indian American community. 15 2. Prospective partner organizations that will constitute the client base for the work of the Facility. This category includes a long list of different types of groups, many currently involved in development work together with some with a predominantly domestic focus that have a skill or technology that has potential relevance for India's development. This category will include: educational institutions, professional associations, advocacy groups, policy research organizations, scientific research organizations, community-based organizations, private voluntary development organizations and international humanitarian groups. The durability and success of a partnership will depend on a long term mutual consensus that institutional benefits exceed institutional costs. A number of studies indicate that the likelihood that this will happen depends on key factors discussed in this report, including similarity of organizational function; complementarity of organizational purpose; overlap of program priorities; a perception of synergy; and a desire to grow in size through forming a partnership. This analysis suggests that the following types of partnership relations are most likely to develop as a consequence of Facility work:     Partnerships between American private voluntary development organizations (PVOs) and Indian NGOs. Partnerships between American advocacy groups and Indian NGOs and advocacy groups. Partnerships between American firms operating in India and Indian development and/or humanitarian NGOs or Indian scientific research or advocacy organizations. Partnerships between policy research groups in the United States and development and/or humanitarian NGOs in India.  15  With respect to the Indian American community, our analysis concluded that it is unlikely, in our judgment, that this constituency will become a significant consumer of the services offered by the proposed Facility in the near term. Indian Americans are represented by an impressive and growing array of Indian American organizations that link their skills and financing to charitable organizations engaged in development activities in India. Another important point to bear in mind is that the community is still in the early stages of becoming comfortable with American style philanthropy and is more comfortable in supporting religious and charitable causes to which they have personal connections in India.   40    Partnerships between scientific research groups in India and/or the United States and advocacy groups in India and/or the United States. Partnerships between Indian educational institutions and American scientific research and/or advocacy groups. Partnerships between professional associations in India and America.  Finally, the analysis provides an indicative list of activities that the Facility should consider in order to promote its program activities and generate interest among potential partnering entities. Specifically, the Facility should:          Employ staff that are trained and capable in pursuing an entrepreneurial approach to partnership formation; Undertake an active outreach effort that involves making presentations to prospective partners, visits to prominent facilitating organizations like the Council of Foundations, Interaction etc; Participate actively in conferences, seminars and workshops on key development issues relevant to India; Establish an interactive website for stakeholders to express their views on Facility design issues as part of the design process; Once the Facility is established, regularly produce a newsletter that is widely circulated across a wide spectrum of organizations; Organize ""trade fairs"" that bring together a wide spectrum of organizational types and provide a forum for them to interact; Make contributions to scholarly journals that highlight best practices in partnership formation and management; Follow-up with institutions which have generally appeared to show interest in the Facility; and Structure a Board of Directors that posses an extensive range of senior-level relationships among the types of entities likely to utilize Facility services.   41  -- Chapter 4 -- LESSONS LEARNED ANALYSIS  Identify relevant lessons learned from a review of USAID's experience in founding undertakings similar to the Facility in other countries. USAID Experience in Establishing Similar Facilities: Lessons Learned The consulting team reviewed the literature associated with USAID's experience in helping to establish independent institutions along the lines of the proposed Facility, especially where USAID was limiting or terminating over time its bilateral programs. The team also interviewed selected USAID officials responsible for managing the USAID relationship with these institutions as well as representatives of several of these organizations that have a Washington presence. The objective of this work was to identify the lessons learned that are relevant to the planning of the Facility in India. Our research revealed a wide array of profiles and experiences with regard to USAID supported partnership organizations/foundations and how they were designed, implemented and monitored. In this regard, we were unable to identify any USAID supported organization that could serve as a precise role model for the proposed Facility in India. This is because the preponderance of USAID-supported activities have had partnership formulation as a step in the process of attaining a specific program goal, rather than as an end in itself. However, there were a number of USAID undertakings aimed at supporting or creating independent development organizations with case histories of relevance to the India proposal. The responsibilities of USAID in terms of monitoring and overseeing these independent entities varied greatly and depended on the ""corporate culture"" of individual USAID missions and the history of the recipient organization itself. Many organizations to which USAID provided assistance for institutional strengthening and/or program support, whether existing or newly created, were part of a larger USAID graduation strategy. Supporting Local Organizations USAID has several modalities available to support capacity building for existing or newly created organizations. They include direct project grants, grants provided under a cooperative agreement, and endowments (either in local currency or USAID provided appropriated dollars). Most of the endowments that have been funded by USAID were intended to strengthen the viability of existing local organizations as opposed to binational organizations with a mandated binational board of directors. An important objective in virtually every case of USAID support for an endowment was enhancing sustainability of the organization. Early local organizations endowed by USAID that have impressive track records today include the Korea Development Institute and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology. The original intent of US support for these organizations was to create two institutions independent of government that would continue contributing to Korean development. Although not   42 explicitly designed to further US-Korean linkages, this did in fact result over time, according to a recent CDIE evaluation. An example of an endowment aimed at strengthening a local institution was the USAID endowment for Profamilia, the Colombian affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Profamilia's business plan calls for increased cost recovery and diversification of services. These measures, along with income from the endowment, are expected to ensure its viability as USAID phases out support for population activities in Colombia. The Case of FUNDECOR A contrasting approach toward local institutional development is found in the example of the Fundacion para el Desarrollo de la Cordillera Volcanica Central (FUNDECOR), a Costa Rican NGO that was established to implement a USAID-supported forestry project. Using resources from this project, USAID funded technical assistance through Price Waterhouse to assist FUNDECOR create and develop its organizational structure as well as its operating and financial control systems. Subsequently, $5.5 million was provided under the project through a cooperative agreement with FUNDECOR for a series of activities in natural forest management. FUNDECOR was incorporated in May, 1989. It is controlled by a five member Board of Directors which maintains administrative and policy control. The USAID Mission and Price Waterhouse were involved in the selection of FUNDECOR's initial professional staff of six including the executive director, financial manager and the chief accountant. The FUNDECOR policy and procedure manuals for procurement, personnel, administration and accounting as well as its business code of ethics were developed by Price Waterhouse and the Foundation staff. The manuals were reviewed by the USAID Controller's office which determined that FUNDECOR's accounting, record keeping and overall financial management systems and internal controls, met the applicable standards set forth in AID regulations. Furthermore, FUNDECOR had access to managerial and technical assistance through the USAID contract with Price Waterhouse for the life of the cooperative agreement. Along with the USAID Controller's certification, the USAID reviewed FUNDECOR's technical capacity. It concluded assistance provided under the cooperative agreement, adequate technical skills at its disposal to plan and carry envisioned in the project statement. Rural Development Office that, with the technical FUNDECOR would have out the forestry activities  Based on FUNDECOR's successful implementation of its cooperative agreement with USAID, USAID and the CostaRican Government on February 8, 1996 agreed to set up an endowment that would help fund FUNDECOR after the USAID supported forestry project ended. The endowment was funded with local currency generated by US foreign assistance provided to Costa Rica under a series of Economic Stabilization and Recovery Agreements. The equivalent of $7.5 million in local currency was irrevocably transferred FUNDECOR Trust Fund. The trust fund is managed by a Costa Rican Bank. The is invested in Costa Rica's national capital market. The trust agreement between and the Costa Rican Government states that the purpose of the trust is to to the corpus USAID provide   43 financial support to FUNDECOR primarily to cover management costs and to attract additional funds for the trust, including soliciting contributions from public and private sources. In accordance with the terms of the trust agreement, a Trust Technical Committee of five members was created. All members, who serve for staggered five-year terms, are appointed on a consensus basis by USAID (two nominations), the Government of Costa Rica (one nomination), and FUNDECOR (two nominations). The Trust Committee is responsible for, inter alia, overseeing the trust fund's investments, approving the annual budget of expenses to be financed with funds from the trust, and for contracting an annual external technical evaluation of FUNDECOR's accomplishments. Owing to sound investment decisions by the financial institution that manages the Trust's investments, and successful outside fundraising, the value of the FUNDECOR Trust has doubled since its creation. Binational Organizations Binational organizations (mostly foundations) display a binational character in the structure of their management, although their programs may be focused exclusively in one country. USAID's funding of binational foundations has been primarily through the creation of an endowment, typically as part of a USAID transition or graduation strategy. The CDIE report entitled ""USAID Graduation: Recent Experience and Outstanding Issues"" dated May 1999 is USAID's most recent effort to evaluate USAID support for binational foundations. The report contains four mini case studies -- Costa Rica - USA Foundation for Mutual Cooperation (CRUSA); Portugal - Luso-American Development Foundation (LADF); Thailand - US-Thailand Development Partnership (USTDP); and Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe-American Development Foundation (ZADF) that are useful to review in thinking about the Facility. The lessons learned from the USAID experience in creating the above organizations may be summarized as follows. 1. A clear objective(s) for the organization should be established at the outset. 2. Broad but clearly defined areas of programmatic activity should be identified at the outset. 3. Careful attention should be given to how the board is selected and who is chosen for it. The stature and quality of the founding board members sets the tone for high quality operations. 4. The number of US and cooperating country board members should be equal. 5. A date should be established by which time all USAID monitoring and oversight responsibilities will cease. (In this regard, it should be noted that USAID Policy Determination No. 21 requires a 5 to 10-year oversight period for endowments financed with USAID appropriated dollars.)   44 6. The best and most sustainable programs funded by binational organizations are partnerships with strong backing by the individual partners. 7. Partnerships must be anchored in a NGO or university with an established track record. 8. The design process must pay special attention to the tax structures of the partner country and the United States. 9. No USAID-supported foundation was able to attract private corporate funding for its basic endowment. 10. Generating a given annual level of program and administrative funds requires an endowment fund 15 to 20 times as large. The Case of the Baltic American Partnership Fund The Baltic American Partnership Fund (BAPF) has been suggested as a possible model for the proposed Facility in India. BAPF was established in 1998 by USAID and the Open Society Foundation (the Soros Foundation) as a public-private partnership. Each founder has provided $ 7.5 million to the BAPF to be spent over the next ten years. The BAPF is a New York-based public charity, directed by an independent board of directors. The board is composed of prominent individuals who are committed to the democratic and civil society mission of the organization, and to the objectives of the BAPF in all three Baltic nations. However, because the BAPF is engaged primarily in making grants to local NGO for civil society activities, rather than fostering cross-national partnerships, and because the BAPF is on a path to self destruct following ten years of grant making, rather than seeking to become financially self-sustaining over the long-term, it does not serve as a replicable model for the India proposal. Endowments It is unlikely that the proposal for a joint Facility will have as a prominent feature an accompanying endowment, at least at the outset. However, because the issue of financial sustainability for the Facility will need to be addressed in the design process, and because the longer-term vision for the Facility includes the possibility of evolving into a USAID legacy institution, the consulting team reviewed the available literature on USAID funded endowments with USAID appropriated funds. An endowment, at times called a trust, is a sum of money set-aside for a specific purpose and invested to generate a stream of income over time. USAID's policy regarding endowments is set forth in USAID Policy Determination 21 -- Guidelines: Endowments Financed with Appropriated Funds. This document delineates the major aspects of the endowment process and structure, and offers general guidelines concerning the roles and responsibilities of those responsible for managing an endowment. PD-21 was issued in July, 1994. It has not been revised since then. Importantly, we were told by the senior policy official at USAID responsible for endowments that USAID at this time has no plans to review and/or alter PD-21. Thus, PD-21 remains the operative policy guidance for USAID endowments.   45 PD-21 outlines some of the possible ""objectives"" that may justify use of the endowment mechanism. Those relevant to the possible application of an endowment for the proposed Facility are set forth below: 1. Broaden and enhance the funding base of an NGO; 2. Encourage the establishment of philanthropic principles in countries where such principles are less well-established; 3. Institutionalize an activity allowing it to continue beyond USAID funding; 4. Continue development strategies through international or indigenous groups upon termination of USAID presence. In November 2001, USAID contracted with Deloitte Touche for an evaluation of USAID dollar appropriated endowments. The evaluation carried out by Deloitte Touche and entitled Funding for the Future? Lessons from the Past, noted that more than 30 USAIDfunded endowments have been implemented under PD-21. In broad sweep, the Deloitte Touche evaluation team reported that most of the endowments are considered useful and successful. Some of the relevant conclusions of this report were: 1. A rigorous screening process for potential recipient organizations is needed to ensure that those that receive an endowment can manage and implement it properly. 2. Holding recipient organizations accountable for financial reporting and spending is vital to maintaining support for the endowment mechanism. 3. USAID and recipient organizations must have a clear understanding of the administrative costs of establishing and maintaining an endowment. 4. USAID and the recipient organization must properly calculate the size of the endowment needed to generate a desired stream of income. The report notes that a methodology has been developed for this purpose. The report also recommends that USAID improve its capacity to monitor endowments once established to ensure compliance with the grant agreement and reporting requirements. We note here that PD-21 offers specific guidance regarding potential recipients of USAID dollar appropriated endowments, including that they meet pre-survey award requirements, and have a specified use for the endowment in line with programs and activities of the organization. PD-21 does not dictate the age or profile of a recipient organization but does observe that new and weak institutions tend to require higher degrees of monitoring and oversight, which in some cases indicates that an endowment is not an appropriate mechanism. In such cases, PD-21 recommends that a mission consider traditional forms of funding, such as a grant through a cooperative agreement, until the institutional development of the selected organization has taken place and USAID is sure that an endowment is an appropriate mechanism.   46 With regard to the monitoring and oversight of an endowment, PD-21 guidelines note that the grant agreement between USAID and the endowed institution should establish a set period of oversight and recommends a minimum of five and a maximum of ten years. PD-21 does specify a few areas where USAID oversight might be appropriate, though it does not mandate the use of any or all of them. They are: 1. USAID participation on the Board of Directors or as part of the governance structure, though in a non-voting or ex-officio capacity; 2. USAID approval of the first roster of the Board but not subsequent rosters; 3. USAID receipt and review of select annual reports and/or annual plans related to the use of endowment resources. Global Development Alliance Public-private alliances, as promoted by USAID's new Global Development Alliance (GDA), represent an important business model for USAID, and are applicable to many of the Agency's programs. GDA builds on many successful alliances around the world and seeks to take the best of those experiences and significantly expand this approach to meeting development objectives. GDA brings a mix of new partners, including NGOs, private voluntary organizations, cooperatives, foundations, corporations, higher education institutions and even individuals to the development business. USAID has considerable experience with the development of strategic partnerships. The following are but a few of the many successful alliances currently in place: 1. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization is a partnership between the Gates Foundation (which provided a $750 million financial commitment), USAID, international institutions, including the World Bank, United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, the pharmaceutical industry and others to address the 30 million children every year who do not receive vaccinations. 2. Conservation International has partnered with Starbucks Coffee in a USAID program to promote more remunerative and environmentally sound coffee production in the buffer zone surrounding the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in Mexico. 3. The Parks in Peril program, which has mobilized more than USAID funding, is a partnership among USAID, the Nature NGOs, and local government agencies to ensure the protection threatened Latin American and Caribbean national parks and significance. $70 million of nonConservancy, local of up to 37 critically reserves of global  The formation of the GDA expresses USAID's strong commitment to developing future alliances and partnerships. In this regard, it provides a positive policy framework and is entirely consistent with the goals and objectives of the proposed Facility.   47   Identify lessons learned from the experience of other institutions attempting similar undertakings in India. Indian Experience in Establishing Similar Facilities: Lessons Learned In this section, we seek to highlight the case of an important experience in the Indian context initiated in the mid 1990s by Winrock International (US) to create an independent entity in India. The initial plan was to create in India an organization that would support collaborative work between Indian and American scientists engaged in applied agricultural research relevant to Indian agricultural development. Winrock International carried out a study in the US to assess interest among the Indian American community in supporting this effort, both financially and as volunteer scientists. The idea of creating a sinking-fund endowment with USAID support also was explored. Notwithstanding some positive indications from the Indian American community and USAID, this initiative faltered and eventually withered. Subsequently, Winrock International decided to set up an independent entity in India that would be named Winrock International - India. This entity was created in the late 90s as a Society under Indian law. The Society option (as opposed to a Trust or a nonprofit company under the Companies Act) was chosen because Winrock International wanted the Indian entity to qualify as a NGO, thereby making it attractive for NGO funding from the international donor community. Winrock International engaged counsel in New Delhi to sheppard the paperwork through the Indian system for the creation of Winrock International - India as a society. The process was time consuming and arduous, but once set up the entity has not encountered any fall-out problems related to the Indian laws governing the functioning of a society. The board of directors is comprised entirely of Indian nationals although there is a member from Winrock International in the US who serves as an ex-officio member. Winrock International financed all the substantial startup costs associated with the creation and initial operations of Winrock International  India. An important element of the agreement between Winrock International and Winrock International - India was that the CEO for the first two years would be from Winrock International in the US and that the two organizations would evenly split the costs of this CEO. As of this writing, the Winrock International CEO will complete her term in June 2003, and will be replaced at that time by an Indian national. With regard to the FCRA process, Winrock International reported that the process was time consuming and included a visit to Winrock International  India offices to validate its bona fides. Since the FCRA system has been in place, however, Winrock International  India has not encountered any problems or protracted delays in receiving funds from its American counterpart. At the beginning of the relationship between Winrock International and Winrock International - India, the US entity was actively engaged in managing the operations of Winrock International  India. Friction between the two entities, culminating in a reaction from the Indian side, was eventually resolved by the devolution of full operating authority from Winrock International to the CEO of Winrock International  India. Today, Winrock International - India has about 47 employees (two thirds are professionals and the costs of most are charged against projects) and about $1 million in annual revenues that are derived from project activity financed by the Ford Foundation,   48 USAID, the Danish and Dutch aid agencies, the World Bank and the Government of India. Winrock International-India now covers all of its expenses from revenues, including a one percent franchise fee paid to Winrock International in the US. The lessons learned, based on the Winrock International and other experience in India in trying to create institutions and foster partnerships, are as follows: 1. A foreign entity should avoid micro-managing its Indian partner and instead respect its independent nature. After Winrock International adopted a hands-off attitude toward the management of Winrock International India, the latter came into its own, becoming financially and programmatically self sufficient (except for the CEO arrangement which by prior agreement will pass to an Indian national in June, 2003). 2. A good understanding of Indian rules and regulations concerning the establishment of an entity under Indian law and governing the transfer and accounting of funds from abroad is essential. Winrock's experience was that once the set up period was completed, everything has functioned without a problem. 3. Engaging respected legal counsel and an established accounting firm in India to provide guidance in dealing with Indian policies and regulations, as well as the Indian bureaucracy, is money well spent. 4. Indian NGOs need to expand fund raising programs that are required for financial sustainability.  Synthesize these lessons learned into a set of recommended parameters to be used in structuring USAID/India's role and relationship to the Facility. The recommended parameters for structuring USAID's role in the Facility are as follows: 1. Ensure that the new entity is legally and structurally independent from USAID and that it is viewed as master of its own destiny. USAID should intrude as little as possible into the internal affairs of the new entity, consistent with ensuring that it has adequate internal control and financial accountability systems in place. 2. USAID should provide grant financing to cover institutional start-up costs. Following this, when the new institution's financial and technical capabilities are certified by USAID financial and technical experts, USAID should enter into a cooperative agreement with the institution to finance program activity for a limited number of years. Once the institution has a track record of program achievement and success, it may be considered an attractive entity for a USAID endowment and/or private donor financing. 3. Careful attention should be given by USAID to how the board is selected and who is chosen for it. The stature and quality of the founding board members set the tone for high quality operations. USAID should ensure that the number of US and cooperating country board members is equal. 4. USAID should have a representative on the Board of Directors, though in a nonvoting capacity. It should also enter into negotiations with the Government of India to have a similar representation from the Indian government side.   49  5. USAID should approve of the first roster of the Board but not subsequent rosters. 6. A date should be established by which time all USAID monitoring and oversight responsibilities will cease. In this regard, it should be noted that USAID Policy Determination No. 21 requires a 5 to 10-year oversight period for endowments financed with USAID appropriated dollars. However, if the Facility is to attract eminent persons from key institutions in India and the US then, it will have to agree to keep a notional oversight from the beginning. 7. USAID should ensure that the design process pay special attention to the tax structures of the partner country and the United States. 8. Since no USAID created organization has been able to attract private corporate funding for its basic endowment, specific efforts will need to be made to ensure that funding sources for the entity's operating costs are covered from other than corporate sources. Indian corporate financial support to cover operating and program costs should be initiated at the earliest. 9. Generating a given annual level of program and administrative funds requires an endowment fund 15 to 20 times as large. This ratio should be born in mind when considering the evolution of the partnership. It may be worthwhile to consider building a revenue stream in the Facility for providing services to for profit and financial institutions. 10. The partnership process managed by the new Facility will need to give special recognition to inadequate capacity on the part of many potential Indian partners to manage programs and account for resources.   50 Lessons Learned Summary Our research revealed a wide array of profiles and experiences with regard to USAIDsupported partnership organizations/foundations and how they were designed, implemented and monitored.

Specifically, this analysis:  Builds upon the findings of the broader gender analysis prepared by USAID/India during its recent strategy development exercise; and  Has been prepared in keeping with guidance provided in USAID's Automated Directive System section 201.3.4.11. The Rationale for Paying Attention to Gender while Planning and Implementing the Facility Gender Analysis and Women's Participation Will Contribute to Achievement of the Facility's Goal of Social and Economic Development Among development specialists and donors, there is now widespread acceptance of the proposition that achieving sustainable development depends on paying attention to women's participation and to gender issues. Some at USAID recognized this as early as the 1970s with issuance of a still relevant women in development (WID) Policy Paper. Two decades later, on the heels of the Fourth World Conference on Women, USAID articulated its commitment to gender equity, and to gender and development (GAD), through the 1996 Gender Action Plan. USAID institutionalized that policy by establishing both required and recommended procedures in the Automated Directives Service (ADS).16 Thus apart from the fact that the ADS requires some analysis of gender-related barriers and opportunities in new project design, such an analysis is a way to strengthen the design and implementation of the proposed Facility. It should be noted at the outset that this gender analysis references three related but different concepts: (1) WID and specific attention to women's participation, (2) gender analysis, and (3) gender equity. We reference WID because it focuses on women's particular needs, roles, access to capital, legal rights and capacity-building. While it does not analyze the reasons behind differences in access to resources, services, and opportunities between men and women in a given society or group, it typically calls for projects or project components to compensate for such differences. In contrast, gender analysis (a component of GAD) focuses on the participation of and benefits to each gender in development programs, while promoting women's leadership There are three key sources of USAID policy related to WID and GAD: The WID Policy Paper of 1982, (USAID, Office of Women in Development, Washington DC) the Gender Plan of Action of 1996, and the ADS Revisions from 1999 and later. Through the WID Policy paper, USAID stated a commitment to:  Take account of actual and potential roles of women in carrying out development assistance program;  Support women's institutions and programs where special efforts are required to reach women because of cultural conditions; and  Recognize that the productivity of women is important to personal, family and national well-being. 16   53 of and equality in program and organizational structures. Gender analysis enables us to identify (1) the reasons for differences in access, roles, opportunities and power, and (2) their consequences for individuals (men and women), households, communities and economic development in general  and attempts to modify their negative aspects. Gender equity fits within a normative or rights-based discussion. It refers to the goal of fairness, ending sex-based discrimination, removing barriers to equal access and accepting women's legal rights. The central goal of the proposed Facility is to produce outcomes that have a positive result on development. As a matter of equity, ""development"" should mean improved social and economic circumstances for all. Thus in India, as elsewhere, development should benefit the approximately 50% of the population who are women.17 Further, however, as was noted in USAID/India's 2001 Gender Assessment, women's status, poverty, and gender-based exclusion impede effective development in India.18 Lastly, if given the opportunities, women will contribute substantially to development. Three of India's greatest challenges are population growth, poverty and public health.19 In each case, women's education, healthcare and empowerment are key focuses for meeting those challenges. As India is a diverse country, of different cultures and classes, so, too, there is a vast range and variety of Indian women. But from poor and uneducated women who have used micro-enterprise to generate desperately needed household income, to highly educated Indian women who are among the most experienced gender equality experts and advocates in the world, they offer determination and expertise that are critical assets for producing outcomes that have a positive result on development. Attention to Gender and to Women's Participation Will Add Value and Enhance Implementation of the Facility Apart from the general goal of the Facility, the project as conceived will benefit from attention to women and gender. One objective of the Facility is to increase the quantity and quality of collaboration between American and Indian organizations that work in the area of social and economic development. It will also work to identify and support innovative ideas, solutions, methodologies and technologies. Purposeful inclusion of women will enrich those efforts, adding diversity to quantity and quality, which in turn generates greater innovation. Further, the Facility will encourage alliances that are ""dissimilar"", in terms of organizational subject matter and organizational type, recognizing that such partnerships may be more difficult to construct and manage, they are likely to have a higher societal impact. Paying attention to women and women's groups, as well as groups whose work focuses on gender-related challenges, may offer valuable opportunities to broker novel partnerships.  17  In ""India ... women face strong cultural and social biases that present major obstacles to their obtaining quality healthcare, secure livelihoods, political enfranchisement and social equality.""

Opportunities to Strengthen the Facility by Institutionalizing Attention to Gender and WID Failure to recognize gender and institutionalize attention to it could result in a facility that inadvertently ignores some of India's key development problems. Just as the Gender Assessment identifies such development challenges, the Facility must be constructed and operated to ensure that it encompasses them. Unfortunately, experience has taught us that even when an institution or organization begins by paying attention to gender and women, they all too often slip from the agenda, lost among other goals and pressures. There are a number of areas where gender and/or women's participation may be forgotten  but if remembered, may strengthen the Facility's operations:  When seeking and engaging partners, in the US and in India, who have resources, commitment, ideas to contribute: Make sure not to forget Indian American women as sources of support. When seeking to identify and address constraints to partnering: Make sure to identify and address constraints that are particular to women's organizations, to women's issues, or to women as partners. When paying attention to the difficulty anjd cost of translating an approach or methodology that is suited to the American context to one that is viable and effective in India: Make sure to think in terms of gender-related roles, power and resources. When contending with the difficulty that many organizations (particularly social purpose not for profit) have in contemplating a diminution of institutional sovereignty as a consequence of an alliance relationship: Pay attention to sensitivities of women's organizations, fearful of losing control to larger, more sophisticated and possibly male-directed partners. For example, imagine a relationship with great substantive potential  but an American man accustomed to making decisions and a strong self-made Indian woman as leaders of their respective groups. It would be important to manage their collaboration, so they can learn to work together effectively. When laying the groundwork for the possible establishment of a US/Indian Legacy Foundation: Be aware of the danger of creating or perpetuating distorted legacies, See Gender Assessment, p. 5.          20   55 e.g. some of earlier, colonial development that introduced European biases by focusing on men  and thereby reducing the roles or status of women. If building partnerships is increasingly central to development, and motivations include access to additional donor resources, sharing of information, sharing of technology and best practices, chances for joint project implementation  then it is crucial that new concepts and approaches build attention to women's needs, status and contributions from the outset.  When seeking to counter a possible conservative cultural bias: Make a point of listening to and working with women. They may be an example of where there may not be a scarcity of creative insights but a capacity to move those good ideas to fruition. Careful involvement of women may assist the search for tipping points' that will multiply the impact of limited resources. When seeking the advantages of dissimilar alliances: Find opportunities where, rather than matching women's groups with women's groups, it may be possible to match women's groups with universities, hospitals or marketing experts. This may also be a good source of cross-sectoral and cross institutional relationships. When building on the expectation that the role of the independent voluntary sector will be pivotal: Note that women are typically a large part of the third sector. Yet women's NGOs and women in the third sector, may be among those whose absorptive capacity is limited  and with strengthening could be ready to accept and utilize resources. It will be important to ensure that they benefit from voluntary sector capacity-building, experience and resources. When looking for ways to attract US corporate support: A focus on the workforce, e.g. regarding child labor, women's labor rights or corporate codes of conduct, may generate corporate interest. When concerned with the difficulty in understanding the importance and in overcoming the inequality in the power balance of the relationship: While well intentioned, many alliances founder on tensions rooted in a perception of inequality. Paying attention to gender may improve sensitivity to similar issues, e.g. understanding disparities of power and resources between men and women helps to anticipate similar disparities between partners in the US and India. Being on the lookout for and understanding the power and resource aspects of gender-based barriers might strengthen the capacity of the Facility's staff and board members to overcome other barriers, thereby improving the capacity to nurture successful alliances.          Strategic Points for Ensuring Attention to Gender One interesting aspect of the Facility is that it involves not only the substance of its work, but also the establishment of an institution. There are a number of aspects of the institution-building, where it will be important to pay attention to gender and to women. Definition and Values of the Facility   56 As pointed out in Chapter 3, it is important to ensure that the Facility is perceived as an indigenous organization with Indian affiliation and roots, reflecting Indian values and priorities. Yet India is a diverse country, with values and priorities that may differ according to such factors as class, religion, location and gender. Though it may not be easy, it will be important to ensure that there is diverse participation and influence in defining those values and priorities. The Facility's guiding norms and rules will emerge from drafting a charter and by-laws pursuant to the principles and guidelines set forth by the institution. Ensuring that gender equality as a norm and objective, and gender analysis and women's participation as ways of achieving the Facility's goal, will depend on memorializing such commitments in the charter and by-laws. Gender concerns play an important role in the strategic planning process aimed at identifying sectoral and/or organizational priorities. The selection of these priorities will be based on an analysis of the potential for establishing strong and/or partnership relationships that are likely to have significant impact on India's development. Failure to incorporate attention to gender into strategic planning and the identifying priorities may result in missed needs and opportunities.21 Facility Capabilities With regard to institutional capabilities, the Facility will need the capability to identify, assess and address issues of women in development and gender equity. That capability will be important at several levels internally, as well as externally.  Board of Directors: The Board composition will reflect ""gender balance"" as one factor. In addition, however, attention must be paid to gender expertise being both US and Indian. (Might there be a risk if all the women were from India, and the men from the US?) It will also be important that the Chair of Board be open to, and supportive of, women and gender-focused development. Otherwise, there is a risk of internal tensions, clashes, and limited impact of women or gender supporters on the Board. When ensuring access to key leaders and influential thinkers in the development community, include women and experts on gender. The capacity to monitor and evaluate (M&E) a portfolio of diverse relationships with partnering groups including the capacity to identify relevant measures of progress and success. This M&E capacity should include the capacity to assess gender impacts.     Core Functions A number of ""nuts and bolts"", basic functions, will ensure that the Facility benefits from women's contributions and contributes to their development needs:  21  But note that the sub-sectors that have been discussed are each tied to women: education and literacy, HIV/AIDS, micro and medium enterprise, energy issues (see Gender Assessment, p.15-16) and population and family planning (see Gender Assessment, p. 11-14).   57  Database: It should include information about the key topics raised in the Gender Assessment, including violence against women, trafficking in women and girls, information technology and gender, training of women elected officials, child labor and girls' education (Gender Assessment, p. 17-19). In addition, however, the database should include a wide spectrum of information about development organizations that might work with or for women, and provide basic gender expertise. Studies and analysis: When such studies are undertaken to identify areas of potential collaboration, their terms of reference should include the expectation that they will look at women's needs, ideas and potential collaboration. Marketing and outreach: Madison Avenue advertisers learned long ago the importance of demographics for marketing. Generalized outreach, conferences, fairs and articles, among other mechanisms, will not necessarily reach the women or organizations who focus on gender equality, work with women, or might bring new skills, approaches and resources to women's needs. Information exchange: As with marketing, when establishing mechanisms such as a website, newsletter, or conferences, each should incorporate a strategy regarding women. There may also be a need for information exchange focuses particularly on women or gender expertise. Grant support: Ideally, with all of the other provisions regarding capacity, data, management, etc. it will not be necessary to establish set-asides or quotas for grants for women. Yet, the Facility should have the capacity to monitor the number of women grantees and projects about women or gender equity. If monitoring turns up deficiencies, the Facility should be prepared to take corrective action.          Seven Key Institutional Recommendations The discussion in the previous section identified strategic entry points for ensuring that the Facility benefits from women and gender analysis. Though that discussion suggests various opportunities to strengthen the Facility through attention to gender, the following are seven key recommendations to institutionalize that attention. 1) The Board: Ensure that the Board includes women and gender supporters from both India and the U.S.  Include questions regarding gender and women in Board surveys or interviews.  Include gender balance as criteria for overall diversity. 2) Staffing: Ensure that either the Executive or Deputy Director has gender expertise, along with one grants officer and one sectoral specialist.  Draft job descriptions to include expected expertise regarding gender or WID. 3) Charter and By-Laws: Make sure that the approved NAD, and then the charter and by-laws, incorporate the Facility's commitment to gender equality, women's participation and women as key assets for achieving the Facility's objective of outcomes having a positive impact on development. (This is essential, because   58 leadership and staff change, and because this is what sets the overall culture and expectations.) 4) Principles to Guide Sectoral and/or Organizational Priorities: In determining programmatic priorities, include as a guiding principle sensitivity to gender and/or incorporation of women as one factor. 5) External Advisors: In establishing expert advisory panels, have one on women in development and gender analysis. Anticipate and budget for 1-2 management consultancies relating to gender and development, women, etc. 6) Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E should include monitoring and reporting related to gender equality, women's participation, and gender-related lessons learned. After year 2, require a focused evaluation of the Facility's capacity and accomplishments relating to gender. In the Year IV and Year V Program and Impact Evaluations, include expected attention to women and gender within the terms of reference.   59 Gender Analysis Summary The central goal of the proposed Facility is to produce outcomes that have a positive result on development. As a matter of equity, ""development"" should mean improved social and economic circumstances for all. Thus in India, as elsewhere, development should benefit the approximately 50% of the population that are women. One objective of the Facility is to increase the quantity and quality of collaboration between American and Indian organizations that work in the area of social and economic development. It will also work to identify and support innovative ideas, solutions, methodologies and technologies. Purposeful inclusion of women will enrich those efforts, adding diversity to quantity and quality, which in turn generates greater innovation. Further, the Facility will encourage alliances that are ""dissimilar"", in terms of organizational subject matter and organizational type, recognizing that such partnerships may be more difficult to construct and manage, they are likely to have a higher societal impact. Paying attention to women and women's groups, as well as groups whose work focuses on gender-related challenges, may offer valuable opportunities to broker novel partnerships. Key recommendations for addressing gender described in this analysis include: The Board: Ensure that the Board includes women and gender supporters from both India and the U.S. Include questions regarding gender and women in Board surveys or interviews. Include gender balance as criteria for overall diversity. Staffing: Ensure that either the Executive or Deputy Director has gender expertise, along with one grants officer and one sector specialist. Draft job descriptions to include expected expertise regarding gender or WID. Charter and By-Laws: Ensure that the approved NAD, and then the charter and bylaws, incorporate the Facility's commitment to gender equality, women's participation and women as key assets for achieving the Facility's objective of outcomes having a positive impact on development. (This is essential, because leadership and staff change, and because this is what sets the overall culture and expectations). Principles to Guide Sectoral and/or Organizational Priorities: In determining programmatic priorities, include as a guiding principle sensitivity to gender and/or incorporation of women as one factor. External Advisors: In establishing expert advisory panels, have one on women in development and gender analysis. Anticipate and budget for 1-2 management consultancies relating to gender and development, women, etc. Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E should include monitoring and reporting related to gender equality, women's participation, and gender-related lessons learned. After year 2, require a focused evaluation of the Facility's capacity and accomplishments relating to gender. In the Year IV and Year V Program and Impact Evaluations, include expected attention to women and gender within the terms of reference.   60  - Chapter 6 LEGAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS  Examine the advantages and disadvantages of alternate legal and organizational structures available under US and Indian law through which the Facility could be incorporated, and recommend and justify that deemed most appropriate. We present below the analysis and recommendations prepared by the legal analysts. Background and Assumptions Stage 1  USAID partners with a credible Indian entity to set up the Facility in India and provides initial funding.  The Facility will be managed and operated by Indians.  The Facility will endeavor to build partnerships between US and Indian entities in a variety of socio-economic sectors and will identify good and credible non-government organizations and projects to fund and help develop.  A part of the activity of the Facility will be to make grants to specific projects in India. Stage 2  Facility receives donations from various Indian, US entities (including corporates) and non resident Indians (""NRIs"").  USAID funding is minimised as private funding increases.  Facility may set up an entity in the US or may partner with an existing entity in the US. Stage 3  Facility may need the flexibility to look at generating revenues to support its activity on a non-profit basis.  USAID exits. Key USAID objectives are:    Fund utilization  basic objectives. The Facility will be Indian managed and administered. At a later stage, USAID can, after having established and firmly operationalized the Facility, have the flexibility to eliminate its involvement in the Facility. 22  We have examined the following possible options that may be considered for setting up the Facility in India:  The legal briefs were prepared by Trilegal, a Delhi-based law firm. To the extent possible, the legal analysis has been presented in its verbatim state. (The term NRI used by the lawyers, for example, has been purposefully left in this section). This has been done deliberately, so as to preserve the sanctity of the legal counsel received.  22   61    Company set up under Section 25 of the (Indian) Companies Act, 1956 (""Companies Act""). Regular private limited company. Trust. Society.    In addition, we have also examined the implications of setting up the entity in the US as a non profit corporation. Company set up under Section 25 of the Companies Act (""Section 25 Company"") General  The Facility may be established in India as a company incorporated under Section 25 of the Companies Act, formed with the objective of promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object.  A license will have to obtained from the Central Government for registering the Facility as a company with limited liability under Section 25 of the Companies Act. Advantages  A Section 25 Company enjoys certain privileges under the Companies Act, which are otherwise not available to associations or unincorporated entities. For example, its officers and members enjoy immunity from personal liability; it also enjoys certain exemptions, granted by the Central Government, from the applicability of certain administrative provisions of the Companies Act.  A Section 25 Company is not required to have a minimum paid up share capital like a regular private limited company.  USAID will be able to nominate its representatives on the board of directors of the company even if these representatives are resident outside India.  It can undertake a wide range of activities and its objects can be modified should the need arise, to provide services on a nonprofit basis.  Such a company would be able to charge a fee for facilitating Indo-American partnerships. However, it must apply its profits in promoting its objects and cannot pay dividends to its shareholders/US legal entity.  Indian entities/individuals contributing to a Section 25 Company (provided the Section 25 Company gets a tax exempt status) will be eligible to get a tax break on donations made under Indian income tax laws. Disadvantages  A license will have to obtained from the Central Government prior to setting up a Section 25 Company.  A Section 25 Company must apply its profits in promoting its objects and cannot pay dividends to its shareholders.  Application has to be made to obtain a tax exempt status to benefit its funders. Regular private limited company General  A private limited company, not being a Section 25 Company, may also be considered.   62  Advantages  A private limited company has greater flexibility in terms of the business activities it can undertake. It can undertake ventures for profit.  USAID would be able to nominate directors on the board of directors of the company. Directors can be resident outside India.  A private limited company would be able to generate revenue and pay dividends to its shareholders out of its profits.  A private limited company can enter into joint ventures with other companies and also invest in other companies. Disadvantages  Donations to a private company do not give a tax exemption to donors, therefore reducing its attractiveness to donors.  A private limited company must have a minimum of two shareholders. USAID, being an agency of the federal government of the US, may not be able to hold shares and will accordingly have to authorize persons resident either in the US or in India to hold shares. Trust General  The Facility may be established as a trust in India for managing/regulating the use of funds received from the US entity.  Trusts may be of two types, charitable trusts and private trusts.  Charitable trusts must be established for a charitable purpose of general public utility, such as poverty alleviation, education, medical relief, etc. A charitable trust enjoys certain tax benefits under Indian tax laws and donors are entitled to tax exemptions.  A private trust is, to the contrary, usually set up for specific beneficiaries such as relatives or friends and not for society at large and does not usually enjoy tax benefits.  The management of a trust is vested with the board of trustees who can remain so for life and need not stand for election. Foreign nationals can be appointed as trustees, subject to their obtaining necessary clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Advantages  Under Indian law, certain tax exemptions are available for income derived from property held under trust for religious and charitable purposes, including income in the form of voluntary contributions made with a specific direction that they shall form part of the corpus of the trust. Disadvantages  A trust offers less flexibility in responding to changing requirements and in modifying the objects as laid down in the trust deed. Only the settlor of the trust can modify the objects of the trust laid down in the trust deed.  At the time of registration of the trust under the Trusts Act, the Registrar will require foreign nationals who are trustees to obtain necessary clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India. Further, if such nationals are absent from   63 India for a continuous period of six months, they will not be eligible to remain trustees. Tax exemptions may not be available to private trusts. The liability of trustees is not limited.     Society General  The Facility in India may be set up as a society, with at least seven members and will need to be administered by its governing council or board, appointed by the general body of members.  For foreign nationals to be members of a society, specific permission of the Registrar of Joint-stock Companies will have to be obtained.  To get tax exempt status for donors, the society has to obtain an exemption from Indian income tax authorities. Advantages  A society can undertake a wider range of activities than a trust, which must be set up for a specific purpose. The objects of a society can be modified more easily than those of a trust.  Unlike in the case of a trust, a society has a distinct legal entity, independent of its members.  It has limited liability and its members or executives are not personally liable to settle the society's dues.  Indian tax laws provide for exemptions from taxation of society incomes (subject to certain conditions) provided incomes are applied to the society's objectives and procedural formalities.  Members will be eligible to get a tax exemption on contributions made, provided the society obtains a tax exempt status. Disadvantages  A society cannot charge fees for services unless it is clearly shown that such activities will promote another object which is charitable or public.  A society cannot distribute gains/profits.  It is more difficult to amend the by laws of a society to change its objectives than it is to amend the by laws of a company. Entity in the US  Under Section 501 (c) 3 of the US Internal Revenue Code (""IRS Code""), a non profit corporation that is organised and operates exclusively for charitable, educational, or religious purposes is eligible for a tax exempt status and contributions are tax deductible for the donor. - A nonprofit corporation however, cannot issue shares and cannot pay dividends to its members. In addition, under the IRS Code, a tax-exempt corporation (such as a non profit corporation) cannot pay dividends and, upon dissolution, must distribute its remaining assets to another nonprofit group. - The ability of donors to get tax exemption for donations made to a Section 501 (c) 3 company, where the funds are ultimately used to fund activities of the Facility in India must be specifically reviewed by US legal counsel.   64   Provide sufficient detail to ensure that the recommended financial operations of the Facility (e.g. fund raising, grant making, facilitating international transfers etc.) will be appropriate, reflect international lending practices and are in congruence with US and Indian law. The financial operations of the Facility must comply with both US and Indian laws as well as internationally accepted accounting practices. Funding 1. From USAID to Facility in India  The Facility may receive funding from USAID for undertaking any social, economic or charitable project subject to obtaining necessary permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 (""FCRA""). 2. From US corporate entities and NRIs to Facility in India   As mentioned above, specific permission under FCRA will have to be obtained by the Facility from the Ministry of Home Affairs for receiving funding in the form of grants from US corporate entities and NRIs. Tax exemptions to donors may not be available. Needs examination by US legal counsel. 3. From Indian entities to Facility in India  Indian entities, including corporates will be able to provide funds to the Facility without requiring any prior permission from the Government of India. 4. From Facility to entity set up in the US  The Facility will be able to fund an entity set up in the US subject to prevailing Indian exchange control laws and US C-Corp and S-Corp restrictions.  Grant making  The Indian beneficiaries of grants made by the Facility from funds received from US entities (which will qualify as foreign contribution under the FCRA), including USAID, corporates and NRIs will have to comply with the provisions of the FCRA, including furnishing reports regarding the use of the funds. To ensure proper end use, adequate documentation should be executed between the Indian company and the Indian beneficiaries.    Transfers  Transfer of funds from the Facility in India to the US for purposes of setting up the US entity will be subject to the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (""FEMA"") provisions.   65   Examine alternate ways of structuring the relationship between the Facility and USAID, and recommend and justify that deemed most appropriate. In light of our discussion above on the various possible options for structuring the Facility in India, and given the objectives of USAID in setting up the Facility in India, we recommend that the Facility be incorporated as a Section 25 Company under the Companies Act. Such a company would have the following advantages over all the other structures discussed above: Regular private limited company  A Section 25 Company does not require share capital.  It can seek a tax exempt status under Indian income tax laws.  Donors may be able to get a tax break on contributions made to it under Indian income tax laws. Trust  A Section 25 Company can easily change its business objectives from time to time, unlike a trust, which is less flexible in adapting to changing business needs.  A Section 25 Company may have non resident foreign nationals as directors on its board, unlike a trust where foreign nationals appointed to the board of trustees of a trust who are absent from India for a continuous period of six months, are not eligible to remain trustees.  Liability of the promoters of a Section 25 Company is limited. Society  A Section cannot do  A Section subject to 25 Company can charge fees for services rendered unlike a society, which so. 25 Company is easier to manage and administer than a society, which is more regulatory supervision.  The disadvantage that a Section 25 Company may suffer from is that it will not be able to distribute dividends to its members, unlike a private limited company. Any profits will have to be put back into meeting its objectives. Further to discussions held between the legal team and USAID on February 2, 2003, the following response to clarification questions was prepared. To facilitate a comparative analysis of some of the key aspects relating to the setting up of the Facility as a company as against a society, please see a summary of responses in the table below. As mentioned earlier, the comments contained in this memorandum are not exhaustive and all the observations in respect of US law issues must be reconfirmed with a US licensed attorney.  Table: Comparative analysis between a Company and a Society   66 S. No. 1. ISSUES ADDRESSED Permitted objects FACILITY SET UP AS A COMPANY Can have a broad set of objects including promotion of commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object. Objects could be framed/amended so as to enable making of profit for distribution to members. However, in such a case: FACILITY SET UP AS A SOCIETY Can have only those objects specified in the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (""Societies Act"") which include associating for literary, scientific, charitable purposes; for instruction, diffusion of useful knowledge, the diffusion of political education, foundation or maintenance of libraries, public museums, galleries for art and paintings, collections of natural history, mechanical and philosophical inventions, instruments or designs. The objects cannot include promotion of commerce or other unspecified useful objects (which are permitted to a company licensed under Section 25 of the Companies Act). USAID cannot, even if it is willing to lose tax benefits, widen the objects and enable a dynamic set of objects which are not permitted by the Societies Act.  +  +  the words ""Private Limited"" or ""Limited"" from the name cannot be dropped, i.e. benefit of section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 (""Companies Act"") cannot be availed; and tax exemption as discussed below will not be available.  USAID would have the flexibility to widen objects and enable a dynamic set of objects (though this may result in a loss of the benefits discussed above).  2.  Tax benefits under section 12 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (""IT Act"")  Both company and society have to make an application to obtain such tax benefit and the Commissioner of Income Tax has to be satisfied on the genuineness of the objects and activities. Available provided the company is established wholly for charitable or religious purposes. Charitable purpose is defined to include relief for the poor, education, medical relief and advancement of any other objects of general public utility. Available provided the society is established wholly for charitable or religious purposes. Though the term 'charitable purpose' as defined in the IT Act enables a wider set of activities (by use of 'any other objects of general public utility'), a society cannot undertake the same due to limitations in the Societies Act. A minimum of seven members (each founding member is required to have a proper residential address in India) are required to set up a society. By laws of the society, at the time of registration, can have provisions to restrict transfer of membership rights by the members, i.e. provide for prior consent of USAID to any transfer. The bylaws can further provide that such provision providing for the above restriction cannot be modified or deleted without prior permission of USAID. Therefore, a society can provide for better control over members than a company.  3.  Setting up the Facility  4.  Control of members (shareholders)  A minimum of two shareholders (they could be resident in India or outside India) are required to set up the company. USAID may be required to ensure that the members nominated by it to hold shares in the company do not transfer the same. This can be achieved by: getting the members to execute adequate undertakings and documentation against transfers; and + making adequate provisions  +   67 S.

Both companies and societies may receive donations from outside India, subject to the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 (""FCRA""), which includes a registration process by the recipient Facility. Both companies and societies may disburse grants to other Indian beneficiaries from donations received from outside India. However in accordance with the FCRA, the Facility will have to file reports of such onward grants with the Central Government. However, if the grant is made from a donation received from within India, provisions of the FCRA will not apply. 9.

Ability to receive grants from outside India Disbursement of grants by the Facility to entities in India  8.  10.  Ability to set up a subsidiary company in the US  Excess assets cannot be distributed amongst the members but have to be given to some other society (three fifth's majority of members can identify such other society). A company/ society can set up a company in the US provided it pays for the shares of the US company from its Resident Foreign Currency (""RFC"") account. A company/society may open an RFC account out of foreign exchange received or acquired as gift (would include grants and donations) or inheritance from a person resident outside India, which would include USAID and corporates/NRI's based in the US. The US subsidiary company cannot be set up with funds received as donations from Indian donors. Funds from the RFC account can be used by a company/society to fund the activities of the subsidiary in the US. A company may open a branch A society may also open a branch office in the US with the prior office in the US with prior permission of the RBI. permission of the Reserve Bank of India (""RBI""). However, in certain cases there is a possibility that the license issued to the company under section 25 of the Companies Act, may impose a restriction on the  11. 12.

In such a restriction is imposed in the section 25 license, the company will lose the benefit of Section 25 should it open a branch in the US. Funds from the RFC account can be used by a company/society to fund the activities of its branch in the US. A subsidiary of an Indian company/society incorporated in the US will be a US corporation and may be entitled to obtain tax exempt status. The status that a branch office of an Indian company/society under US law is not clear and hence its ability to obtain tax exempt status will need to be verified with a US attorney.

Entity in US setting up a branch office/subsidiary in India Setting up the US entity  USAID's ability to set up to set up a company or society or other legal entity in the US will have to be verified with a US attorney. This might include issues under the USAID charter.  Further, the obligations to be met to obtain tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the US IRS Code will need to be verified with a US attorney.  Setting up the Indian entity  Implications/ability of a US Section 501(c)(3) US IRS Code to set up a subsidiary in India will need to be verified with a US attorney.  Indian law implications are dealt with below.  Branch office  The legal entity in the US (could be a US company/society, but not a trust) may set up a branch office in India.   The branch office will not be able to receive any donations from USAID, other US based corporates/NRI's and Indian donors. The branch office cannot disburse grants to beneficiaries in India. This is true even if the donations are received by the parent entity in the US which funds the branch in India.  Subsidiary Indian company  The US entity may set up a wholly owned subsidiary company in India.   69  Such a subsidiary company may be incorporated as a private limited company with a minimum of two shareholders and obtain a license under section 25 of the Companies Act. Funds from the US entity can be brought into the Indian subsidiary either as equity (under the automatic rout) or as a loan subject to External Commercial Borrowing guidelines issued by the Government of India, or as donations subject to FCRA requirements. Such an Indian subsidiary can receive donations from US corporates and NRIs in accordance with the provisions of the FCRA. The Indian subsidiary can disburse grants to beneficiaries in India in accordance with the provisions of the FCRA. There is no restriction on such Indian subsidiary receiving donations from persons in India. The Indian subsidiary will require prior approval of the RBI to fund the activities of the US parent. However, at present, there is lack of clarity at the RBI end in respect of such a permission being granted.         Conclusion In the event flexibility in objects is of greater concern to USAID than absolute foolproof control of the Facility in India, setting up the Facility as a company in India is recommended. Such a company should obtain a license under section 25 of the Companies act. However, if absolute foolproof control of the Facility in India is of greater concern to USAID than flexibility in objects, then setting up the Facility as a society is recommended. As a consequence of further discussions held with USAID on February 11, 2003, the legal team prepared the following response to clarification questions presented by USAID: Question: Is the Facility in India under the obligation to ensure that recipients in India of grants made by it from funds received from outside India have prior approval of the Central Government to receive such funds? Our response:  Under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 (""FCRA""), a person must obtain prior permission from the Central Government before receiving any foreign contribution.  Under section 23 of the FCRA, whoever assists any person in accepting any foreign contribution in contravention of the provisions of the FCRA is liable to be punished with imprisonment upto five years or with fine, or with both.  Therefore, in light of section 23 of the FCRA, the Facility in India should ensure that it takes all necessary steps to verify whether the Indian recipients of its   70 grants have the necessary approvals from the Central Government to receive such funds. Question: Does an Indian subsidiary company have the ability to use funds in a resident Foreign currency (""RFC"") account to finance activities of US parent company? Our response:  An Indian subsidiary would require permission from the Reserve Bank of India (""RBI"") to fund the activities of its US parent company from funds in rupee accounts other than RFC accounts.  Regulation 5 (2) of the Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Currency Accounts By A Person Resident in India) Regulations, 2000 permits the use of funds in an RFC account for investments in any form outside India without any restriction.  Regulation 4 (a) of the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer Or Issue Of Any Foreign Security) Regulations, 2000 permits a person resident in India to purchase foreign securities out of funds held in an RFC account.  Therefore, in our view, a person resident in India, including a company and a society in India, can use funds in an RFC account for any investment outside India.  However, from our discussions with various officials of the RBI, there appears to be a lack of clarity at the RBI end as to whether an Indian subsidiary company can fund the activities of its US parent entity. While some officials are of the view that prior approval of the RBI will not be required, others are of the view that such approval is required.  Given the lack of clarity at the RBI end, a conservative approach may be to make an application to the RBI seeking specific approval for the Facility to fund the activities of its US parent company from funds in an RFC account. Directors' Insurance  Various insurance companies provide different insurance schemes for directors of a company. The usual exclusions to these insurance schemes are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Willful or intentional infringement of law. Criminal behavior. Libel, slander or other defamation. Fraudulent acts. Environmental damage or pollution. Bodily injury and property damage. Fines, penalties and other penal liabilities.  Question: What are the exemptions available under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 1961 (""IT ACT"")? Our response: There is no particular preference, both in law and in practice, accorded to a society over a company licensed under Section 25 of the Companies Act in seeking a registration under Section 12AA or exemptions under Sections 10 (23C) or 35AC of the IT Act.   71 Section 12AA  An institution, including a company licensed under section 25 of the Companies Act or a society, may seek an exemption under the IT Act if it is involved in a ""charitable purpose"" as defined in the IT Act, which includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility.  An application must be made to the Commissioner of Income Tax (within one year from the date of creation of the company) to get it registered under Section 12AA of the IT Act as a body being run for charitable purposes. Upon the Commissioner of Income Tax being satisfied that the institution is being run for charitable purposes, it will be registered and will be granted a tax exempt status.    Section 10 (23C)  There are various institutions/funds that are eligible for exemption from income tax under Section 10 (23C) of the IT Act, such as the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund, the Prime Minister's Fund (Promotion of Folk Art), the Prime Minister's Aid to Students Fund, the National Foundation for Communal Harmony, etc.  In addition to the above, any institution established for charitable purposes (such as the Facility) that is notified by the Central Government (Ministry of Finance) may seek an exemption from income tax under Section 10(23C)(iv) of the IT Act by making an application to the Director General (Income-tax Exemptions), who is the authority empowered to grant such exemption.  Section 35 AC  An association or institution involved in a project or scheme for promoting the social and economic welfare of the public or for general upliftment of the public for three years or less, may seek approval from the National Committee (which is a committee constituted by the Central Government under the IT Act from amongst persons of eminence in public life) for grant of a tax exempt status.  The project or scheme must be related to one or more of the following: 1. construction and maintenance of drinking water projects in rural areas and in urban slums, installation of pump sets, digging of wells. Tubewells and laying of pipes for supply of drinking water 2. construction of dwelling units for the economically weaker sections; 3. construction of school buildings primarily for children belonging to the economically weaker sections of society; 4. establishment and running of non-conventional and renewable sources of energy systems;   72 5. construction and maintenance of bridges, public highways and other roads; 6. any other program for the uplift of the rural poor or the urban slum dwellers, as the National Committee may consider fit to support; 7. promotion of sports; 8. pollution control; 9. establishment and running of educational institutions in rural areas, exclusively for women and children upto twelve years of age; 10. establishment and running of crches and schools for the children of workers employed in factories or at building sites; 11. establishment and running of hospitals and medical facilities in rural areas, exclusively for women and children upto twelve years of age; 12. encouraging the production of bacteria induced fertilizers; 13. any program that promotes road safety, prevention of accidents and traffic awareness; 14. construction of hostel accommodation for women or handicapped individuals or individuals who are at the age of sixty five years or more; 15. establishment and running of institutions for vocational education and training in rural areas and towns which consist of population of less than five lakhs.  Such approval is usually granted for a period not exceeding three years at a time. Subsequent approvals, if required, for a further period, may be granted only if the National Committee is satisfied about the activities of the institution during the preceding period of approval.  Director / Governing Body Liability Company - Liability of Directors Under the Companies Act, the general powers of the management of the company's affairs are vested in the board of directors, except those powers which can be exercised only with the consent of the shareholders in the general meeting of the company. There are various duties and liabilities upon the board of directors. The board of directors has individual liabilities and collective powers. General Directors of a company are liable for offences/defaults committed by the company under various legislations. An indicative list of various legislations that   73 may be applicable to the Facility in India, under which the directors of the Facility may be liable for offences/defaults of the Facility, is provided below:  Employee State Insurance Act, 1948 - The managing director of a company, incharge of the affairs of the company, is liable to be prosecuted for any default committed by the company. Employee Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952  The managing director of a company, if proved to be incharge of the affairs of the company, is liable to be prosecuted for any default committed by the company. Minimum Wages Act, 1948 - The entire board of directors will be liable for prosecution for any default committed by the company. Customs Act, 1962  If a company commits an offence under the Customs Act, 1962 and if it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance of a director or if it is attributable to any negligence on the part of any director, such director shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.       Liability under the Companies Act The Companies Act contains various provisions under which a director of company may be personally held liable for acts and omissions specified in those provisions. An indicative list of such provisions is provided below:  Section 147 (4)  An officer of a company or a person acting on his behalf who does certain acts or signs certain documents like promissory notes and does not mention the name of the company, can be held to be personally liable. Section 542  Any person found guilty of conducting the business of a company fraudulently may be held personally liable for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company. Section 543 - Any director, past or present, of a company or any manager or officer of a company can be held personally liable for all the losses which have been caused to the company due to their fraudulent conduct or any misfeasance or any breach of duty or any breach of trust. Section 538  Any past or present officer of a company can be imprisoned for a term of upto 5 years or fined or fined and imprisoned both for an offence committed in the course of liquidation of the company. Section 539 - Any officer of a company guilty of falsifying the books of account shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.           74  Section 540  Any officer of a company who induces any creditor to contribute to the company and subsequently gets the company wound up shall be liable to be fined and imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years.  In addition to the above, a company must comply with various statutory requirements prescribed under the Companies Act such as filing annual returns with the Registrar of Companies, etc. Failure to comply with this and other requirements under the Companies Act may result in the imposition of a fine on the company and every director or officer responsible for ensuring such compliance. Liability of members of the governing body of a society  The Societies Registration Act, 1860 does not specify the liability of the members of the governing body of a society and as mentioned above, the liability of the members of the governing body of a society may be limited through the by laws of the society. However, the members of the governing body of a society will remain liable for offences committed under other legislations like the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948, the Customs Act, 1962, etc.    Procedure and Timelines for Incorporating A Company Under Section 25 of the Companies Act 1. Application to Registrar of Companies (""ROC"") for name availability  Select, in order of preference, a few suitable names, not less than four (one of them being the main name), each of which bears a close relation to the main objects of the proposed Facility. Apply to the ROC of the state in which the company is proposed to be incorporated in Form No. 1A (along with a fee) to ascertain the availability of names. This application is normally processed within seven working days of receipt of application by the ROC.     2.  Drafting the memorandum and articles of the company   Draft the memorandum and articles of association and have them reviewed by a solicitor/company secretary/chartered accountant. Get the memorandum and articles of association reviewed by US legal counsel, particularly to ensure applicability of Section 501 (c) (3) of the IRS Code and USAID federal charter. The drafting and review of the memorandum and articles of association can be completed before filing the application for name availability with the ROC.     75  3.  Application to Regional Director for issue of license  Immediately upon receipt of ROC approval for the name of the company, file an application to the Regional Director for issue of license under Section 25 of the Companies Act for the company to be incorporated as a company without the addition to its name of the word ""limited"" or ""private limited"" accompanied with the relevant documents.  4.  Forwarding copy of application to the ROC  Simultaneous with filing the application with the Regional Director, forward a copy of the application to the ROC along with the relevant documents. On receipt of such application, the ROC shall scrutinize the documents to ensure that they are in conformity with the provisions of the Companies Act. The ROC, after scrutinizing the documents, shall forward his report to the Regional Director, with any changes or modifications, if any, to the memorandum and articles of association within thirty days of receipt of the application.    5.  Publication of notice  Within a week of making the application to the Regional Director, publish a notice inviting objections from the public in the prescribed form in at least one newspaper in a principal language of the district in which the registered office of the company is to be or is located and at least once in an English newspaper circulating in that district.  6.  Forwarding copy of notice to Regional Director  Immediately on publication of the notice, forward a certified copy of the published notice to the Regional Director.  7.  Issue of License by Regional Director   The Regional Director, on being satisfied, will then issue the license and stipulate certain conditions governing the license. While the Regional Director is required to issue the license within 30 days from the date of filing the application, in practice, the process could take upto six months if additional information/documents are required to be provided.  8.  Certificate of Incorporation by Registrar   File a copy of the license issued by the Regional Director with the ROC accompanied by the necessary registration and filing fees. The certificate of incorporation of the company is then issued by the company usually within seven days.   76  9.  Total time for incorporation  It could take upto seven months to incorporate a company licensed under Section 25 of the Companies Act.  Based on a search of non profit websites in the US, the DAI design team obtained the following information concerning the creation of a non profit corporation in the United States. Under Section 501 (c) 3 of the US Internal Revenue Code (""IRS Code""), a non profit corporation that is organized and operates exclusively for charitable, educational, or religious purposes is eligible for tax exempt status and contributions are tax deductible for the donor. A non profit corporation however, cannot issue shares and cannot pay dividends to its members. In addition, under the IRS Code, a tax-exempt corporation (such as a non profit corporation) cannot pay dividends and, upon dissolution, must distribute its remaining assets to another non profit group. The ability of donors to obtain tax exemption for donations made to a Section 501 (3) (c) company must be specifically reviewed by US legal counsel. A general description of Section 501 (3) (c) follows:  In order to obtain federal tax exempt 501 (3) (c) status in the US, the Facility will have to file an application for exemption of Form 1023 showing that it meets the following tests: 1. It must be organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific or educational purposes; 2. Its net income must not be used, in whole or in part, to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals; 3. It must not as any substantial part of its activities attempt to influence legislation by propaganda or lobbying activities. The US Internal Revenue Service uses two tests to determine whether to grant an organization Federal tax exempt Status: 1. Organizational Test: This test requires that the articles of organization (e.g., corporate charter) contain the following provisions: a. that the organization is being formed for a charitable, scientific, or literary purpose; b. that the organization's assets must be dedicated to the above identified purpose(s); c. that upon dissolution of the organization, its assets will be distributed to another organization that is exempt under Code 501(3)(c) or to the US Government (federal, state, or local) for public purposes. Under no circumstances may the organization's assets be distributed to the shareholders.   77 2. Operational Test: This test requires that a 501(3)(c) organization be operated ""exclusively for"" the prescribed exempt purposes. It will not be regarded as exempt if more than an insubstantial part of its activities is not in furtherance of an exempt purpose. a. Payments necessary to perform exempt functions, such as administrative expenses are exempt unless the amount is unreasonable. b. All salaries paid to individuals of the organization must be reasonable relative to the type of services such individuals provide to the organization. Given the legal and regulatory complexities associated with establishing the Facility as a bi-national entity in both the US and India, the design team recommends that the Facility's documents of incorporation (charter) be subjected to the scrutiny of the following legal reviews: 1. Indian legal counsel with expertise in Indian corporate law; 2. Indian legal counsel with expertise in tax law, especially tax law that pertains to nonprofit corporations and charitable giving; 3. US legal counsel with expertise in setting up Section 501(3)(c) nonprofit corporations to ensure that the charter will qualify the Facility for US tax exempt status; and 4. USAID General Counsel to ensure that the charter will permit the Facility to receive USAID funds through the cooperative agreement mechanism or in the form of an endowment.  Include an organizational chart and a brief description of the most critical positions. The Facility should be structured to plan, manage and carryout the functions described in Chapter 7, Functional Analysis. Since, to our knowledge, the concept of an organization with the specific purpose of fostering partnerships to work on development problems has never been tried before, the organization's mandate, at least in the formative years, should be broad and flexible enough to support experimentation. The Facility should mature and build on both its failures and successes. The Board of Directors: Such a broad-based organization should in principle have a Board that is made up of respected figures representing a broad range of specialties within the development business. The Board members also should represent a range of skills so that it can provide strategic advice and direction to the fledgling organization as it seeks to experiment and explore new areas of partnership building. Linkages with prospective clients and/or donor organizations and individuals will also be important. We recommend a gender balanced board of ten members with approximately equal representation from both India and the US. The Chairperson of the Board should rotate between an Indian and American. With regard to governmental representation, with the exception of USAID participation during the first 3 years, the Board should assiduously avoid ex officio positions. At the same time it would be appropriate and desirable for the   78 Board to include individuals with prior or current government experience. During the first 3 years of operation, it is recommended that a USAID representative sit on the Board in order to insure full and open communication with the Mission and to provide the level of oversight appropriate in a start-up situation of this sort. The design team recommends that the rules of the board include the following precepts: a. The tenure of both the Board members and the Chairperson should be long enough for them to maintain a certain amount of continuity while bringing in change. This period could be for three years. Given the fact that it would be essential that continuity is maintained, half the members of the Board should relinquish office at the end of their term of three years and the remaining half one year later, i.e at the end of four years. The tenure of board members, after completion of the first cycle, should be limited to two terms. b. A team-building retreat should be held for the newly constituted Board early in year two, i.e., as soon as possible following the creation of the Facility and the formation of the Board. Retreats should be held annually in India in conjunction with the semi-annual meeting of the Board. c. The Board should meet once in six months with the period between two meetings not exceeding six months. d. Its role should be approving annual budgets, annual action plans, and giving strategic direction and guidance to the Facility. e. It is anticipated that the Facility will gain gradual autonomy and be independent of USAID oversight beginning in the 4th year of operations. Aside from a gradually declining level of reporting to USAID, the Facility should ultimately operate on the principle of full and complete independence. This is particularly important if the Facility is to transpose into a Legacy entity and if that ultimate initiative is to be adequately tested. Chief Executive Officer: Finding a solid, experienced CEO is extremely important. The CEO should be a senior manager with a minimum of 20 years of development experience. We recommend that priority be given to an individual with a managerial background and advanced training in management and organizational development. Foundation experience, prior working experience with a board of directors and work with an Indian and/or American nonprofit organization would be highly desirable. A background in fund raising and marketing would be a valuable additional asset. It is important that the CEO of the organization have the skills to run and chart a course for the organization without undue interference from the Board. Efficiency and ability to take rapid decisions that lead to measurable outputs should define the management style of the organization, and the CEO. Senior Manager, Partnership Management and Marketing (US): The (US-based) Senior Manager, Partnership Management and Marketing, should have a minimum of 10 years of development experience. Because this individual will be located in the United States and responsible for outreach and marketing to US-based groups, he/she should have a background in marketing and fund-raising. In addition, this individual should have high level presentational skills and a technical background in at least one of the areas of Facility priority.   79 Partnership Management and Capacity Building Specialist: This individual should have a background in organizational development and prior experience in the management of a partnership relation. Additionally, this individual should have demonstrated competence in management training. Publications and studies dealing with organizational relations in the commercial and non profit sector would be valuable indicators of competence. Prior development experience would be a positive additional asset. The organizational chart below provides a description of the structure of the proposed Facility:   80  Chairman US / Indian representative, alternatively  Board Members Indian Representatives (5) from  Financial Institutions  Indian NGOs Corporate   Research  Academic U.S Representatives (5) from  Financial Institutions  US NGOs Corporate   Research  Academic Special Invitee  USAID/USG Representative  GOI Representative  CEO  External Communication & Marketing Specialist  Information Technology Specialist  Research & Development Specialist  Partnership Management & Capacity Building Specialist  Grants Management Specialist  Fundraising Specialist  - Office Manager - Accountant - Secretary   81 Legal and Organizational Analysis Summary This analysis examined Indian and US laws that pertain to the creation and functioning of the Facility and provides a recommendation for alternate legal and organizational structures through which it can be established. The following options were considered for establishing the Facility in India:     Company set up under Section 25 of the (Indian) Companies Act, 1956 (""Companies Act""); Regular private limited company; Trust; Society.  In addition, the implications of setting up the entity in the US as a nonprofit corporation were examined. It is recommended that the Facility be incorporated as a Section 25 Company under the Companies Act. Such a company would have the following advantages over the other structures discussed above: 1. It can seek tax exempt status under Indian income tax laws; 2. Donors may be able to get a tax break on contributions made to it under Indian income tax laws; 3. A Section 25 Company can easily change its business objectives from time to time, unlike a trust, which is less flexible in adapting to changing business needs; 4. A Section 25 Company may have non resident foreign nationals as directors on its board, unlike a trust where foreign nationals appointed to the board of trustees of a trust who are absent from India for a continuous period of six months, are not eligible to remain trustees; 5. Liability of the promoters of a Section 25 Company is limited; 6. A Section 25 Company can charge fees for services rendered unlike a society, which cannot do so; 7. A Section 25 Company is easier to manage and administer than a society, which is subject to more regulatory supervision. The legal analysis explored whether the Facility in India is obliged to ensure that recipients in India of grants made by it from funds received from outside India have prior approval of the central government to receive such funds. It concluded that, in light of Section 23 of the FCRA, the Facility in India should ensure that it takes all necessary steps to verify that the Indian recipients of its grants have the necessary approvals from the central government to receive such funds. The legal analysis also examined whether an Indian subsidiary company could use funds in a resident foreign currency account (RFC account) to finance its activities in the US. It concluded that a person resident in India, including a company and a society in India, can use funds in an RFC account for any investment outside India. However, based on its discussions with various officials of the RBI, the legal team believes there is a lack of clarity at the RBI regarding whether an Indian subsidiary company can fund the activities of its US parent entity. While some officials are of the view that prior approval of the RBI will not be required, others are of the view that such approval is required.   82 Given the lack of clarity at the RBI, a conservative approach is recommended that involves making an application to the RBI seeking specific approval for the Facility to fund the activities of its US parent company from funds in an RFC account. Under Section 501 (c) 3 of the US Internal Revenue Code (""IRS Code""), the Facility could set up a nonprofit corporation in the US. The nonprofit entity in the US, if it is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, educational, or religious purposes, would be eligible for tax exempt status and contributions would be tax deductible for the donor. In order to obtain federal tax exempt 501 (3) (c) status in the US, the Facility will have to file an application for exemption of Form 1023 showing that it meets the following tests: 1. It must be organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific or educational purposes; 2. Its net income must not be used, in whole or in part, to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals; 3. It must not as any substantial part of its activities attempt to influence legislation by propaganda or lobbying activities. Given the legal and regulatory complexities associated with establishing the Facility as a binational entity in both the US and India, the design team recommends that the Facility's documents of incorporation (charter) be subjected to the scrutiny of the following legal reviews: 1. Indian legal counsel with expertise in Indian corporate law; 2. Indian legal counsel with expertise in tax law, especially tax law that pertains to nonprofit corporations and charitable giving; 3. US legal counsel with expertise in setting up Section 501(3)(c) nonprofit corporations to ensure that the charter will qualify the Facility for US tax exempt status; 4. USAID General Counsel to ensure that the charter will permit the Facility to receive USAID funds through the cooperative agreement mechanism or in the form of an endowment. Finally, the analysis presents an organizational chart that illustrates the structure of the organization. It presents guidelines for consideration in electing Board Members. We recommend a gender balanced board of ten members with approximately equal representation from both India and the US. The Chairperson of the Board should rotate between an Indian and American. With regard to governmental representation, with the exception of USAID participation during the first 3 years, the Board should assiduously avoid ex officio positions. At the same time it would be appropriate and desirable for the Board to include individuals with prior or current government experience. During the first 3 years of operation, it is recommended that a USAID representative sit on the Board in order to insure full and open communication with the Mission and to provide the level of oversight appropriate in a start-up situation of this sort.   83  -- Chapter 7 -- FUNCTIONAL, PROGRAM AND FINANCIAL OPERATIONS ANALYSIS  Justify the recommended functions based upon the findings of the sector, constraints, participation, gender and lessons learned analysis. Also, describe the program operations the Facility will undertake to fulfill each of these recommended functions. Based on the sector, constraints, participation, gender and lessons learned analyses, the following principles were identified for application in guiding the identification of functions for the Facility: 1. Cost efficiency, (low overhead to program ratio); 2. Entities both in the US and in India should benefit from program interventions (i.e. benefits should not flow entirely one-way); 3. The Facility should be highly visible in India and the US; 4. Facility-supported partnerships should be focused on developing an innovative approach to an intractable Indian development problem; 5. Program decisions should be independent of the US and Indian Governments; 6. Planning should take place presently for launching private fund raising campaigns starting in year four; 7. Gender equality should be mainstreamed into the Facility's program activities. The assignment of board and staff members for the Facility should be gender balanced to the extent possible. The previous analyses point to the following institutional functions for the proposed Facility. The proposed functions link directly to the constraints identified in the Constraints Analysis and are designed to improve the functioning of the marketplace for partnership formation. 1) Building institutional data bases and information dissemination: An identified constraint to partnership formation and building is the lack of easy access to information on potential partner organizations in the US and India. Thus, a proposed function of the Facility is the building of an institutional data base and the creation of systems for information dissemination. This function would include the following elements:       Construct knowledge data bases; Content creation and content management on American and Indian organizations that are or might prospectively work together in alliance relationships on Indian development problems; Website development including electronic newsletters; Public presentations; Workshops on partnership formation; Information technology support to other operating program units of the Facility.  2) Strategic planning, research and development:   84  The Facility must have the capacity to conduct studies and analyses related to areas of potential collaboration if it is to be at the cutting edge in promoting developmentally relevant partnerships. This function would include the following elements:        Institutional program planning and priority-setting; Conducting studies to identify areas of potential collaboration; Assist the Facility better target scarce resources in high pay-off areas; Identify key institutions both in the US and in India engaged in research in selected focus areas; Match-making between Indian and US institutions in areas of applied research; Foster exchange programs between Indian and US scientists; and Content creation from public domain research databases.  3) Partnership management and capacity building: The Constraints Analysis notes that there is a perception in the US that the complex network of Indian regulatory requirements makes doing business in India costly and time consuming. Thus, a function of the Facility would address this constraint by providing information on how to deal with Indian rules and regulations. This function would include the following tasks:    Provide information and guidance to US organizations on how to work with the official Indian bureaucracy, including information on Indian Government policies and regulations concerning financial relationships between Indian and foreign entities; Serve as counselor to foreign organizations that wish to engage Indian legal and accounting services; Provide technical assistance to potential partnering entities on the formation, management, and sustainability of partnerships, including preparation of partnership formation manuals, pro-forma partnership agreements, and hands-on advisory services; Provide capacity building assistance to partner agencies as needed; Search for and attempt to cultivate partner relations in the Facility's designated areas of priority activity.     4) External communication and marketing: The purpose of this function is to put the Facility on the map, i.e., to publicize and make known the services it offers as well as its program successes. This function will be vital to the successful launch of the Facility as well as its ability over time to raise money from non US Government sources to ensure its financial viability.      Market the Facility's programs and services through Board outreach and event management; Case study documentation and dissemination through conference participation, and publication of articles; Program advertisements; Creative use of an institutional website; Profile partnership success stories;   85    Organize expositions both in India and the US; Conduct press conferences; In year four, launch a program to generate over time non-US Government financial support.  5) Grants program: This function addresses the lack of resources, especially among smaller NGOs, to cover partnership exploration and development costs (e.g., face-to-face interviews and interpersonal information exchanges).        Support a project that will test the viability of a working relationship; Support an experimental approach or new methodology proposed by a new partnership; Help two organizations develop an innovative model, technology or methodology; Assist one prospective member of a partnership work with a counterpart to adapt a technology or approach to the Indian context; Enhance organizational capacity (capacity building) to better manage a partnership relationship; Provide fund raising support to help partnerships identify and obtain additional financial resources; Financial support for partnership matchmaking and building in the form of facilitative grants for travel, conference participation, communications and other partnership development and start up costs.  The analysis will provide sufficient detail to ensure such operations are consonant with US and Indian law as well as internationally accepted accounting practices. The response to this task is contained in Chapter Six - Legal and Organizational Analysis. The analysis will include a cost estimate and financial plan which will provide a reasonably firm estimate of the cost of this activity to the US Government and estimate the amount and function of counterpart financing. We present below a cost estimate for the Facility projected over a ten year period. The budget notes below provide a detailed explanation of the core assumptions underlying the estimate.   86 COST ESTIMATE FOR FACILITY YEAR 1 INDIA OFFICE Contract with management consulting firm for Facility set-up LABOR Position / Classification Professional Staff Chief Executive Officer Partnership Management and Capacity Building Specialist Grants Management Specialist (1) Grants Management Specialist (2) External Communications/Marketing Specialist Research and Development Specialist Information Technology Specialist Fund Raising Specialist Administrative Staff Office Manager Accountant Secretary TOTAL COST -

In year 1, a management consulting firm will be responsible for designing, structuring, and establishment of the Facility. The cost of this contract is estimated to be $1,000,000, assuming the employment of a firm/consortium of firms that provides 3 professional staff (1 US, 2 Indian) members for one year. A core principle underlying the budget relates to the fact that the Facility needs to be structured as an efficient organization with low administrative costs. Therefore, to the extent possible, functions will be outsourced to specialist firms in the areas of information technology/database development, partnership management and capacity building, grants management, and external communications/marketing. Outsourcing costs in each of these programmatic areas have been disaggregated. Further, Facility costs have been disaggregated for India and US operations. Professional and administrative staff salaries have been increased each year assuming a 5% increase in salary. Inflation costs have been factored in, assuming a 4% rate of increase each year. 1) CEO Salary: We have budgeted the CEO's salary at $125,000, which, in our opinion, represents a competitive salary that will serve to attract and retain a senior-level candidate (i.e. with more than 20 years of experience). This salary includes the following components: Base salary; Fringe benefits, including:  House rent allowance;  Superannuation / gratuity;  Provident fund;  Leave travel allowance (Annual leave);  Health insurance;  Local travel allowance;  Economic value added (i.e. bonus). 2) Salaries for TA and Partnership Management Specialist, Grants Specialist, External Communications Specialist, Research and Development Specialist, Office Manager, Accountant and Secretary have also been estimated at competitive rates in an effort to attract and retain the highest quality personnel who remain committed to the organization for a length of time. Each of the stated figures represent a consolidated salary, including base and fringe benefits, the elements of which are described in 1). Finally, a salary for the fundraiser has been estimated at $60,000 starting in year 4, after the organization has established a track record.   88 3) Board Meeting: A board meeting will take place twice every year in India. Each meeting has been estimated to cost $46,000. This figure includes the following components: US Board Members: 5 round trip airline tickets (US-India-US, business class) @ $6,000 per ticket, per diem for 5 days each (2 days retreat, 3 days travel) @ $260, and other miscellaneous costs, including visas, inoculations, local transportation for board members, retreat facility costs, etc. Indian Board Members: 5 round trip airline tickets (domestic, within India, business class) @ $300 per ticket, per diem for 4 days each (2 days retreat, 2 days travel) @ $260, and other miscellaneous costs including local transportation. 4) A. International Travel Costs for Facility Staff in India: International travel has been estimated at $33,000 / year. The assumptions underlying this are as follows: CEO: 4 trips / year (India  US  India) * $3,000 = $12,000 Partnership Management Specialist: 1 trip / year (India-US-India)*3000=$3000 External Communications Specialist: 2 trips/year (IndiaUSIndia)* $3000 = $6000 In addition, local transportation in the US, visa charges, as well as per diem has been factored in for these trips, assuming each trip is for approximately 7 days (including travel time) at an average per diem (in the US) of $200. B. Domestic Travel Costs for Facility Staff in India: Travel for Indian staff has been estimated at $137,200 / year. The assumptions underlying this are as follows: CEO: 20 trips / year * $300 = $6,000 Partnership Management Specialist: 20 trips / year * $300 = $6,000 Grants Management Specialist (1): 12 trips / year * $300 = $3,600 External Communications Specialist: 12 trips / year * $300 = $3,600 Research and Development Specialist:12 trips / year *$300 = $3,600 Information Technology Specialist: 6 trips / year * $300 = $1,800 Total domestic travel costs= $24,600 Local transportation costs while on travel have been estimated at $500 per month. Perdiem has been estimated at 82 trips @ 5 days/trip = 410 days * $260/day perdiem = $106,600. As the grant program increases in scale, the budget allows for the recruitment of a second grants management specialist. Travel costs for the Grants Management Specialist (2) have been budgeted as follows: Grants Management Specialist (2): 12 trips / year * $300 = $3,600  Perdiem has been estimated at 12 trips @ 5 days/trip= 60 days* $260/day perdiem = $15,600.   89 Therefore, from year 4 onwards, total domestic travel costs for Facility staff in India has been budgeted at: $152,800. 5) Office Operational Costs A. Office rent: This has been estimated at $37,500 / year, which is the advertised price for a premium office rental space in Delhi. B.

The total projected cost over a ten year time frame is $39,035,902 million.   93  Functional, Program, and Financial Operations Analysis Summary This analysis recommends that the Facility should focus on the following functions: 1. Build institutional data bases and information dissemination: One constraint to partnership formation and building is the lack of easy access to information on potential partner organizations in the US and India. Thus, a proposed function of the Facility is to facilitate the building of an institutional data base and the creation of systems for information dissemination. This function would include the following elements:       Construct knowledge data bases; Content creation and content management on American and Indian organizations that are or might prospectively work together in alliance relationships on Indian development problems; Website development including electronic newsletters; Public presentations; Workshops on partnership formation; and Information technology support to other operating program units of the Facility.  2. Strategic planning, research and development: The Facility must have the capacity to conduct studies and analyses related to areas of potential collaboration if it is to be at cutting edge in promoting developmentally relevant partnerships. This function would include the following elements:        Institutional program planning and priority-setting; Conducting studies to identify areas of potential collaboration; Assist the Facility better target scarce resources in high pay-off areas; Identify key Institutions both in the US and in India engaged in research in selected focus areas; Match-making between Indian and US institutions in areas of applied research; Foster exchange programs between Indian and US scientists; Content creation from public domain research databases.  3. Partnership management and capacity building: The Constraints Analysis notes that there is a perception in the US that the complex network of Indian regulatory requirements makes doing business in India costly and time consuming. Thus, a function of the Facility would address this constraint by providing information on how to deal with Indian rules and regulations. This function would include the following tasks:  Provide information and guidance to US organizations on how to deal with the official Indian bureaucracy, including information on Indian Government policies and regulations concerning financial relationships between Indian and foreign entities;   94   Serve as counselor to foreign organizations that wish to engage Indian legal and accounting services; Provide technical assistance to potential partnering entities on the formation, management, and sustainability of partnerships, including preparation of partnership formation manuals, pro-forma partnership agreements, and hands-on advisory services; Provide capacity building assistance to partner agencies as needed; Search for and attempt to cultivate partner relations in the Facility's designated areas of priority activity.     4. External communication and marketing: The purpose of this function is to put the Facility on the map, i.e., to publicize and make known the services it offers as well as its program successes. This function will be vital to the successful launch of the Facility as well as its ability over time to raise money from non US Government sources to ensure its financial viability.         Market the Facility's programs and services through Board outreach and event management; Case study documentation and dissemination through conference participation and publication of articles; Program advertisements; Creative use of an institutional website; Profile partnership success stories; Organize expositions both in India and the US; Conduct press conferences; In year four, launch a program to generate over time non-US Government financial support.  5. Grants program: This function addresses the lack of resources, especially among smaller NGOs, to cover partnership exploration and development costs (e.g., face-to-face interviews and interpersonal information exchanges). The grants program will support the following functions:        Support a project that will test the viability of a working relationship; Support an experimental approach or new methodology proposed by a new partnership; Help two organizations develop an innovative model, technology or methodology; Assist one prospective member of a partnership work with a counterpart to adapt a technology or approach to the Indian context; Enhance organizational capacity to better manage a partnership relationship; Provide fund-raising support to help partnerships identify and obtain additional financial resources; Provide financial support for partnership matchmaking and building in the form of facilitative grants for travel, conference participation, communications and other partnership development and start-up costs.  In addition, this analysis provides a cost estimate for establishing the Facility. The accompanying budget narrative provides a detailed discussion of the core elements of the budget, and provides an explanation of the assumptions underlying the budget.   95  To summarize, in year 1, a management consulting firm will be responsible for the designing, structuring, and establishment of the Facility. The cost of this contract is estimated to be $1,000,000, assuming the employment of a firm/consortium of firms that provides 3 professional staff (1 US, 2 Indian) members for one year. A core principle underlying the budget relates to the fact that the Facility needs to be structured as an efficient organization with low administrative costs. Therefore, to the extent possible, functions will be outsourced to specialist firms in the areas of information technology/database development, partnership management and capacity building, grants management, and external communications/marketing. Outsourcing costs in each of these programmatic areas have been disaggregated. The total cost estimates for the Facility on an annual basis for years 1 through 10 are as follows: Year Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7 Year 8 Year 9 Year 10 Cost (in $ millions) $1 $2,589,575 $2,139,696 $3,331,983 $4,414,372 $5,038,523 $5,041,282 $5,098,779 $5,159,151 $5,222,541  The total projected cost over a ten year time frame is approximately $39 million.   96  - Chapter 8 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN  Recommend procedures and a schedule for recruiting and convening a governing board, incorporating the Facility, developing an initial strategy document, recruiting and initial directo"

I am speaking on behalf of the 1.3 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees including over a half million who work for our New York affiliates, New York City District Council #37 and the New York State Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA). The work of this commission has important consequences for all American workers, whether they work in the private or the public sector, as well as for workers in other countries. The negative impact of U.S. trade policy on workers in the U.S. and abroad - most forcefully exemplified by the enormous and steadily growing U.S. trade deficit - has consequences that go far beyond the widely acknowledged problems associated with the dramatic erosion of the U.S. manufacturing base. According to recently released U.S. Commerce Department figures, the goods and services trade deficit increased in 1999 by 65 percent to $271 billion - a record high. This massive U.S. trade deficit is not an abstract accounting figure. Proponents of our present trade policy tout the role of increased U.S. exports in created U.S. jobs. But just as exports create jobs. imports destroy jobs. Our $271 billion trade deficit means that far more jobs are lost due to our present trade policy than are created by it. Increased imports hurt not just workers who lose their jobs, but those still employed who must now compete with goods made in Mexico for a dollar an hour or in China for a dollar a day. Unfair competition from low-wage imports and the threat of corporate relocation to low-wage countries makes workers less secure and less able to seek and obtain higher wages. Our trade polic!, goes a long wa!' toward esplaining whl.. despite our marathon economic expansion, workers' wages have yet to catch up to the level of the mid-1970's. What does this mean for the public sector. where most of AFSCME's members are employed? The public sector cannot prosper and grow if key industries are dying as a result of misguided trade policies that place corporate interests above those of workers and communities. As industries shed high-paying jobs, the state and local tax base that supports public services also narrows. Sometimes. the economies of entire communities are undermined. Case in point: the U.S. government has designated over 207 counties across the country as casualties of NAFTA-related job loss and capital flight. To be designated as such requires not only company- or sector-specific job loss. but major damage to the economy of the entire area. This poses an obvious policy question: why does the U.S. continue to pursue trade policies through trade agreements like NAFTA and the WTO that have proved so harmful to workers and communities? Quite simply, our trade policy favors corporate interests, and corporations benefit from the ability to move to where labor costs are lowest and workers are least empowered.   Corporations also benefit when U.S. workers wages are suppressed due to unfair competition with foreign workers earning poverty wages. While workers wages have grown by 0% since 1973, corporate profits have increased by 88%. So much for the ""rising tide lifts all boats""`theory of trade economics. It is significant that this panel is addressing the role the service sector can play in U.S. export growth. This focus reflects the conventional view that the U.S.' economic future lies in the service sector. Along these lines, supporters of corporate-managed trade policy increasingly look to the service sector as a solution to the U.S. trade deficit. They note that the low unemployment rate is largely a result of rapid job creation within the U.S. in the services sector. They also point to the consistent U.S. trade surplus in the service sector and argue that growth in services and continued opening of global service markets can offset the U.S. trade deficit in goods. However. the most recent trade data cast serious doubts on the notion that U.S. trade in services is the solution to what ails us: between 1997 and 1999, the U.S. trade surplus in services shrank by 18%, and now stands at its lowest point since 1994. And services trade has not grown as a share of U.S. exports since the mid- 1990s. remaining at 22% since 1995. Moreover. advances in telecommunications and intemet technology ensure that services can be provided halfway across the world and exported to the U.S. with the mere push of a button. Trade Agreements like NAFTA and the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). which aim to make services just as mobile as goods, are progressively eliminating barriers to service sector mobility. As a result. public and private sector service jobs in the U.S. are increasingly vulnerable to flight to cheap labor markets overseas. A number of hospitals in the U.S. have outsourced data transcription services to workers in Bangalore. India who make $ I .30 per hour - one tenth of what their U.S. counterparts make. Even high-paying jobs - like accounting and computer programming for instance - have been shipped to ""electronic sweatshops"" in the third world. Information technology industry analysts estimate that overseas outsourcing of computer programming has grown by 30% annually since 1993. Indeed. the fastest growing segment of Mexico's maquiladora industry is services. NAFTA's procurement rules ensure that the public sector as well as the private sector can shift jobs there. For instance, the Navy Medical Center in San Diego pays 30 cents a pound for laundry services outsourced to Baja California, Mexico. The eradication of technological and legal barriers to services mobility, therefore, condemns our public as well as private service sector jobs to the same insecurity as those in the manufacturing sector. Corporate beneficiaries of public services outsourced or privatized by state and local governments will not necessarily keep these jobs in the community; rather, our trade and investment agreements give corporations every incentive to shift these jobs to low-wage locales in the third world. Recent trends in services trade delivery reveal another limitation: since 1996, the majority of U.S. service sales have not been made by U.S.-based service providers, but by U.S. corporations that have established a commercial presence overseas by acquiring foreign banks, utilities, 2   hospitals and other facilities. The GATS agreement and proposed investment agreements like the Multilateral Agreement on Investment are designed to increase this direct investment mode of services delivery. However, service sales of U.S. overseas subsidiaries do not generate .. significant income for the U.S. economy, and in fact can destroy U.S. jobs if the overseas affiliates are supplying services to the U.S. market. Simply, foreign investment in services does not lead to appreciable job growth in the U.S. and does not generate enough income in the U.S. to help offset the trade deficit. The only way to reverse the deficit is to pursue a trade policy that emphasizes respect for the rights of workers in the nations with which we trade. As long as we continue to encourage unfair competition. as long as goods and services made with repressed labor continue to flow unimpeded into the U.S., the net effect of our foreign trade will be to destroy good jobs and deepen inequality. At the same time, until workers in the developing world are empowered to demand decent wages and improve their standard of living. markets for U.S. exports will not prosper. If we are serious about eliminating trade deficit then we must get serious about promoting the enforcement of internationally recognized labor rights. This would eliminate unfair competition between workers in the U.S. and abroad. protect good jobs and promote exports. At the same time. the right to organize and bargain collecrively. the right to a safe workplace, and freedom from forced and child labor must be secured for workers in the developing world if they are to enjoy the fruits of full participation in the global economy. While workers' rights figure prominently in the rhetoric of our trade officials, they have yet to become a fixture of our policy. The misguided trade deal with China and the push for permanent normal trade relations are prime examples. Another major problem with our present trade policy is our posture on privatization. Our trade officials advocate a global agenda of indiscriminate privatization of state-run services. including banking, telecommunications. utilities. healthcare. education and other public services - a policy that actually discourages job and income gro*lh in the developing world. Privatization is, however. a good deal for U.S. corporations. wfho gain the right to compete against weaker domestic industries in those sectors. The U.S. promotes this policy through financial institutions like the international Monetary Fund and the World Bank, global commercial rules like the WTO and NAFTA, and proposed trade agreements like the bills now before Congress addressing our trade relations with Africa and the Caribbean basin. All of these agreements and institutions promote privatization and international competition across the services sector. Not a single one promotes strong labor rights enforcement mechanisms. As a member of Public Services International, AFSCME is concerned that all countries have a thriving public sector that ensures that vital services are provided to communities that need them. Privatization has been cloaked in the rhetoric of eliminating ""the bloated public sector"" in favor of more efficient private competition. U.S. experience in recent years, however, reveals a litany of problems related to privatization of the public sector: low quality of service, higher rather than lower costs for consumers, less accountability to the public, and declining wages and working 3   conditions for service providers. The increasing degradation of healthcare delivery in the U.S. is but one glaring example. The privatization pushed by the U.S. on behalf of multinational corporations is even more painful for poor and developing countries that lack the political, regulatory and legal infrastructure to ensure that corporate providers of public services are held accountable to social goals. For example, according to the United Nations, privatization of water countries has had a perverse effect that ensures that only the wealthy to public water systems. Meanwhile the poor - who have the biggest potable water - are forced to purchase water from vendors, paying 83 Pakistan, 60 times more in Indonesia and 20 times more in Peru. in many developing can afford to be hooked up need for public access to times more than the rich in  In eastern European transition economies, privatization of public utilities has led to massive worker displacement and skyrocketing consumer prices: In Poland, with the elimination of subsidies for poor and rural communities, average domestic tariffs were projected to rise by an estimated 600% by 1997. In Lithuania. electricity prices rose by 400% after privatization. In Hungary, the much-ballyhooed purchase of state-run Tungsram lighting company by General Electric led to the lay-off of 25.000 of Tungsram's 35.000 employees. most of whom were forced into early retirement. Despite the demonstrated failures of indiscriminate privatization and the mounting toll in terms of human suffering. the U.S. has explicitly targeted the health and education sectors for further trade liberalization in the WTO. Our international push for service sector agreements - meaning that once they compete in their services privatization has consequences for the U.S. as well. International like the GATS lock in privatization undertaken by our trading partners have committed to privatize services and allow foreign firms to sectors. international trade rules prohibit them from reversing course.  However. these trade agreements also lock in any commitments the U.S. makes to privatize and open our services sector. These commitments become. in effect. a permanent part of U.S. law. The more the U.S. opens its own healthcarc. education or utilities sectors to international competition. the more difficult it is for the C.S. to reverse its own ill-advised privatizations. Another matter of significant concern for AFSCME is the U.S.' stance on the international regulation of e-commerce. E-commerce is an exciting high-growth service that presents lucrative opportunities to U.S. companies who clearly enjoy a competitive advantage vis-a-vis foreign companies. In its zeal to exploit this advantage the U.S. has pressed for international rules that keep e-commerce as open and deregulated as possible, and has indeed called for a global ban on new internet taxes in the WTO e-commerce working group. What does this mean for states and localities. which depend on sales taxes for a significant part of their revenue? At this time, the U.S. has a moratorium on state taxes on intemet sales in effect ,until 2001. If the WTO adopts the U.S.' ""no new tax"" proposal before then, would state governments be foreclosed from treating intemet sales the same as traditional retail sales for tax 4   purposes? U.S. trade policy makers must make sure that their advocacy on behalf of the ecommerce industry does not lead to trade policy that undermines the fiscal health of state and .. local governments. Other questions arise that underscore the necessity of engaging in a serious, inclusive and balanced trade policy discussion on the tax treatment of e-commerce with state and local stakeholders. For instance, goods like music and books are not only sold over the intemet, but can be sold in digitalized versions and downloaded onto computers as ""virtual products."" If the U.S. presses for these digital products to be defined as services rather than goods in WTO rules, state and local sales taxes would be pre-empted by international law. However, the doctrine of tax neutrality demands that international tax regulations on e-commerce not favor the sale of digital goods over their physical equivalents. International trade rules are more visible and invasive than ever, impacting the whole diversity of policies that affect peoples' everyday lives - from environmental protection to food safety to government procurement. It is this last subject - government procurement -that I would close my testimony with today. When federal, state or local government plays a role in the economy by procuring products or contracting work, these government actions should promote decent pay and fair treatment of workers. Purchasing decisions should also take into account the values of the community. These principles underlie long-standing policies like prevailing wage and affirmative action in government contracting. More recently, these principles have inspired efforts across the country to ensure that workers at firms receiving state or local government contracts or subsidies pay their employees a living wage - efforts in which AFSCME has been proud to play a part. And increasingly, state and local governments in the U.S. are taking human rights issues into account in their procurement decisions - for example. denying government contracts to firms that do business with the dictatorship in Burma. Unfortunately. while social and moral concerns are becoming a more important part of the procurement process domestically, our trade offtcials are negotiating international agreements designed to move government procurement policy in the opposite direction. The GATT Agreement on Government Procurement. which binds over 25 U.S. states and cities, says that the only criteria that a government can take into account when making purchasing choices is the bidders' ability to perform the contract for the least amount of money. Governments cannot screen out corporations that invest in dictatorships, that have abused workers in overseas subsidiaries, that outsource with companies that do not respect basic labor rights, or even use child labor. These rules make it more difficult for governments to make enlightened purchasing choices and more difficult for citizens to hold public officials accountable for the use of tax dollars. Already, this agreement has been used to challenge a Massachusetts law designed to use government procurement as a tool to promote human rights and worker rights.  5   As demonstrated by the variety of subjects I've addressed here today, international trade policy has extraordinarily broad implications for policy making on the state and local levels, as well as the federal level; for government regulators as well as corporate CEOs; for public sector -. employees as well as workers in the manufacturing industry. There is one central flaw that underlies all of the primary failures of U.S. trade policy - from the giant U.S. trade deficit to anti-labor, anti-environmental and anti-public interest biases in institutions like NAFTA and the WTO. This flaw is that multinationals corporations, one of society's narrowest stakeholders, continue to wield enormous influence over the shape of our trade policy, substituting the perceived needs of their executives and major shareholders for the concerns? values and interests of ordinary working Americans. There are encouraging signs that things are about to change. The enormous outpouring of grassroots concern in Seattle last year sent a clear message that working people must not and will not be shut out of the economic decisions that affect our lives. The overwhelming public opposition to permanent NTR for China and the global calls for an end to the IMF's mandatory privatization and structural adjustment policies for poor nations are further evidence of an increasingly engaged public. The trade policy debate, long the private preserve of corporate executives and official experts, is being democratized - heralding an end to the kind of trade rules that undermine living standards. destroy jobs and threaten the quality of life for ordinary people in the U.S. and abroad.  6"

As Vietnam continues the process of integration into the global economic community, companies must learn to compete against companies located in other countries in order to raise standards of living at home. In contrast to mature sectors with slower growth rates, the global software sector continues to grow rapidly and presents unique opportunities for Vietnam. However, participants in the industry must take decisive action and make strategic choices to set the stage for Vietnam's competitiveness for generations to come. Private sector participants in the sector must evaluate their options and be conscious of the different challenges associated with development of software products and services and between targeting the domestic and international market. Strategic collaboration between firms to elevate process improvement, through programs such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and through participation in a Software Process Improvement Network (SPIN) Chapter, may raise the competitiveness of the whole sector. Government and policy makers have a role to play in changing macro-economic factors which affect the competitiveness of the sector. Furthermore, the public sector has numerous tools at its disposal to affect the competitiveness of the sector but must be careful to set the correct priorities. Developing the software sector for export could have lasting benefits in the sector. Finally, there are global technology and licensing trends in the sector, such as open source software development and free software, which could be embraced to create profoundly positive benefits for Vietnam  October 2002  3  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  INTRODUCTION Why discuss competitiveness? The scope of this report The headline of a recent news article in Vietnam News (October 3, 2002) read ""Software industry not growing as hoped"" and cited several statistics which indicated that growth has fallen short of expectations in the industry. While industry targets were set at US$8090 million for the domestic industry and US$200 million for exports, only US$21 million was achieved last year.1 The article continues citing the statistic that FPT, Vietnam's most visible development company, received top line revenues of only US$3 million last year. At a time when Vietnam has begun the process of integration into the global economic community, such reports can have the effect of either discouraging participation and development of the sector or in focusing the minds of industry stakeholders on solving challenges which prevent accelerated growth and development of the industry. The bias of this report on the competitiveness of Vietnam's software industry follows that of business theorists who believe that a nation's wealth is principally of its own collective choosing. According to the writings of business strategist Michael Porter, ""Location, natural resources and even military might are no longer decisive. Instead, how a nation and its citizens choose to organize and manage the economy, the institutions they put in place and the types of investments they individually and collectively choose to make will determine national prosperity."" For Vietnam's software industry to compete globally, it will need close collaboration from a number of organizations involved in the ""industry cluster"" including the IT companies, financial agencies, educational institutions, government agencies, and business and professional associations. These organizations will need to work closely together towards a creating common strategic vision and identifying ways to enhance cluster competitiveness. Therefore, a discussion on competitiveness will help industry cluster stakeholder organizations focus attention on key issues and opportunities to overcome challenges inhibiting development of the sector. The scope of this report is to provide an analysis on the Vietnamese software industry, and its position within the global market, and to outline some strategies for increasing competitiveness of the sector. The report is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of every factor affecting competitiveness of the sector but instead to highlight how Vietnam can realistically benefit from the global trends and changes taking place in the  1  Vietnam News, Thursday, October 3, 2002. Page 2. ""Software industry not growing as hoped.""  October 2002  4  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  software industry. There are two major audiences for this competitiveness discussion including: A: Individual firms making decisions on how to position their companies for competitive advantage in the global market. B: Policy makers, government officials, and other stakeholders seeking to create the right environment to increase Vietnam's competitive position. It's important to address both audiences simultaneously to avoid risks associated with poor coordination. For example, if individual firms are pursuing non-competitive strategies, then the amount of government support and resources required to make the sector competitive will be exponentially greater than if firms are pursuing achievable and realistic strategies. Conversely, government policy can distort the competitive landscape and create artificial market signals that isolate the industry from the global trends and the international economic system. The US Agency for International Development (USAID), in partnership with the Kenan Institute Asia, is committing resources to assist the software development clusters in Thailand and Vietnam with the goal of improving their competitiveness. Efforts are underway to improve quality through Capability Maturity Model (CMM) training and establishing a Software Process Improvement Network (SPIN) chapter in Vietnam. This competitiveness paper is to provide a framework for the Vietnamese software developers and the cluster participants from the private sector and the government to consider areas that need to be addressed to enhance competitiveness. PART I: ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY FOR SOFTWARE COMPANIES Analysis for the firm For Vietnamese firms entering the software sector or for existing software companies making decisions on how to position and become competitive in the global market, they are both a consumer of the business environment in which they operate but also play a role in shaping it. Firm level decisions and strategy should be set with a realistic perspective of key issues and challenges. In the software sector, the key issues for individual companies revolve around interrelated questions that each company must answer to determine how they intend to compete. These questions include: 1. Where should the company focus its marketing efforts, in the domestic or international market? 2. How should the company focus its development efforts, in software services or software products?  October 2002  5  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  Defining the market: Domestic Vs. international market demand Where should the company focus its marketing efforts? The first key issue faced by Vietnamese companies is whether to focus on the domestic or international market. The answer to this question is a function of two main variables the opportunity at hand and the resources an individual company has access to for pursuing the opportunity. In terms of the opportunity at hand, consistent statistics are hard to attain but some sources estimate that the Vietnamese market for IT hardware and services was over US$230 million in 2000. Of that total, local firms have about 35% of the software market which reached a total of US$50 million in 2000 (estimated). Contrast this with the global IT services market (not hardware) expected to reach US$400 billion in 2002. Of that total, the only practical segment for companies in countries such as Vietnam to target is offshore software outsourcing  which represents nearly US$8 billion. Therefore, in terms of magnitude, clearly the larger opportunity is in the international arena. However individuals firms must make a careful analysis to determine whether or not they have the resources to pursue such contracts. As prerequisites to entering the international market, firms must have quality control processes in place, a sufficient track record to attract international clients as well as the sales and marketing infrastructure to make their presence known among potential buyers. There are a number of Vietnamese companies that have opportunistically leveraged a close contact, Viet Kieu relatives, or a previous career to win contracts with significant and reputable international customers. However, there are fewer examples of companies that have converted such one-time advantages into sustainable advantages for their companies. Consider the following: Qualified sales and marketing representatives, a single office presence, and expenses may cost $250,000 a year in a target market such as Japan or the United States. While such a marketing presence might be expected to generate USD$1-3 million per year in revenue, there will likely be a time lag of at least one year before revenue starts to materialize, therefore causing the Vietnamese company to incur a loss on their investment. Given the fully loaded billing rates of $10-12/hour in Vietnam and associated operating and overhead expenses, companies with greater than 75-100 employees may be the only ones capable of risking such losses to increase their market presence if they rely solely on internally generated funds and not outside investors. So in addition to client references and proven quality assurance mechanisms, a clear investment threshold exists for companies that might be interested in pursuing international customers. Alternatively, for companies not of sufficient scale to realistically pursue the international market, the domestic market provides an opportunity. However, the challenges associated with the domestic market are of a different nature. Procurement processes are not transparent, payment by clients are often delayed and sometimes not forthcoming at all, and for companies that have developed their own software products - intellectual property infringement is rampant through widespread piracy. Such realities undercut the ability of companies to recoup their investment. While the financial threshold for participation in  October 2002  6  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  the domestic market is lower, the opportunity is smaller and, according to many industry participants, the headaches associated with success in the market are much greater. CASE: Adjusting to global changes: VietSoftware, a small software development company headquartered in Hanoi, was founded at the height of the internet bubble and successfully won outsourcing contracts with several U.S. based companies. When the U.S. technology market contracted, VietSoftware discovered that it did not have the U.S. sales and marketing presence required to continue receiving U.S. contracts and therefore, turned to the Vietnamese market as a stabilizing revenue source. After solidifying its local position, the company has subsequently turned its attention back toward the US market and successfully won contracts with large companies such as IBM. Assessment for the future Despite the challenges that have occurred to date, there are favorable trends which provide reasons for optimism for industry participants. In the domestic market, Vietnam has begun participating in IPR protection treaties and the government is expecting to increase procurement of software and IT services as they implement Master Plans and Egovernment initiatives. Such activities will increase domestic demand. More compelling, but only for companies that can take advantage of the opportunity, is the state of the international market against the backdrop of global trends. The current international market against the backdrop of global trends For many years, offshore software development was considered an experimental or fringe activity by many multinationals. However, it has quickly become considered a more mainstream practice and with cost cutting pressures increasing, the number of companies prepared to use offshore providers is expected to grow by 50% over the next several years. Existing companies utilizing offshore providers are expected to double their budgets allocated to offshore development in the same time frame. How does this trend affect a company sitting in Vietnam? Currently, India is the undisputed leader of offshore services with greater than 80% of the market. However, it is expected that the Indian labor pool will not keep pace with the expected spike in international demand. While estimates range depending on the reported source, the trend is clear. By 2005, the Indian labor pool will approximate 700,000 professionals, but demand for offshore IT professionals will number greater than one million. Therefore, as supply falls short of demand, wage rates in India are expected to rise. Already, Vietnam provides a lower cost alternative to India and as the wage rate differential increases over the next few years, companies will increasingly be seeking alternatives for their offshore outsourcing.  October 2002  7  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  Demand for outsourcing professionals and primary source of supply 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Global Demand India Supply 145 440 360 522 635 850 1,065 582 645 710 (Numbers have been rounded and are in thousands)  Recently the World Bank released a report assessing ICT development in Vietnam and indicated that Vietnam will ""never achieve superpower status"" with regard to software development. Given the magnitude of differences between Vietnam and a country such as India and to a lesser extent China, this point should be obvious. However, in light of the global expansion of the market, there is room for companies from many countries to participate. Although Vietnam may present itself now as an alternative to India, customers indicate that its long run competition given wage rate structures and global visibility will come from countries such as Russia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. To illustrate the importance that buyers place on cost, consider the factors that buyers use in their decision making process for selection of offshore providers. What Criteria Do You Use When You Choose Offshore Software Providers?1 Cost 55% Technical capability 45% Quality 30% Reputation 25% Expertise 20% Speed 15% (Note: Multiple responses accepted from surveyed companies.) We shall take a closer looks at how Vietnam fares in each main category. Cost: With cost considerations figuring so high in the decision making process and underemployment being so prevalent in Vietnam, we can only expect that international contract opportunities for Vietnamese companies will continue to grow into the future. Already, Vietnam is being utilized as an overseas development center (ODC) for many Fortune 500 companies and this trend will increase as these companies expand their offshore outsourcing budgets, look to mitigate global risks (e.g. potential India and Pakistan conflicts), and seek lower cost alternatives to India. Technical capability: Vietnamese software engineers have been rated on par with their counterparts in other countries for technical aptitude. However, Vietnamese engineers are better known application development, maintenance and testing rather than for skills in areas such as design. 1  Forrester Research, 2001 (Multiple responses were accepted from surveyed companies).  October 2002  8  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  Quality: Quality is more often associated with process and managerial measures rather than pure technical output. To date, Vietnamese companies do not have the same reputation for quality as their counterparts in other countries. Certification for CMM and ISO are quality indicators usually sought by foreign customers and will be discussed later in this report. Reputation: In terms of reputation for offshore software development, Vietnam is relatively unheard of in overseas markets. Recently published IT reports by groups like Research Vietnam, increased interest by the Western media, and some mention by investment analysts gave Vietnam some initial visibility during 2002. CASE: Vietnam as an alternative to India. While there is anecdotal evidence of Vietnamese companies receiving increased attention as an alternative supplier to India (UBS Warburg Analyst Report, Aberdeen Global Outsourcing Best Practices report) there are also concrete examples of success. TMA Solutions recently beat two Indian companies in head-head competition for a contract with US technology company Critical Path. Such contracts may foreshadow more to come. Defining the sector: Software Services vs Software Products How should the company focus its development efforts? A second key issues facing every software company is whether or not to develop software products or services. The set of skills required to manage and market software services are far different than those of a software product company. A services company reacts to the customized requirements of a client while a product company must define and defend a niche, package integrated bundles of value points, capabilities, and features, build a brand, develop marketing channels, and provide after sales service. The latter requires a more complex skills set, far more investment, and is beyond the capability of most young companies. For software companies considering entry into the international market, there are very few examples of successful product oriented companies, while there are numerous successful cases of service oriented companies. The software industry in India has followed the services oriented model toward development. Companies entering the software market often begin by competing on a competitive wage structure. This allows them to sell services that focus on low-end life cycle activities such as code writing, testing and maintenance. As the company develops deep domain expertise, it may move up the product lifecycle to design, specification and requirements setting. At this stage, some firms utilize personnel certification, increased organizational capability, and a satisfied customer base to evolve from providing pure software services to rolling out niche products in the domain expertise of the company. If successful, the enterprise will learn to control competitors and to discourage new entrants by setting industry standards in the domain area of expertise, by rolling out products on a product line basis, and by packaging integrated bundles of value points, capabilities, and features.

Although the investment and resources required to sell software products internationally are high, there are some examples of Vietnamese companies accomplishing that goal but on a limited scale. Paragon Solutions Vietnam (PSV), subsidiary to the US company Paragon Solutions, has developed SoftSim, an eLearning simulation tool which has received awards and recognition in the US for technology innovation and excellence. Customers are in the U.S. The Dolsoft Company, a Vietnamese developer of GIS software and database visualization tools, has been successfully selling shrink-wrapped software products into the European market for many years and has recently broken into the US market.

Once assessed, a firm must decide to compete on price or innovation. In other words, by offering similar products or services to their competitors at a lower rate or by offering unique products or services for which there is no competition. In the near term, Vietnamese firms competing in the domestic market must decide upon a price/innovation strategy but Vietnamese firms looking to the international market will be competing primarily on price. For firms attempting to lower the sales and marketing barrier but not willing to make the required investment for an overseas presence, paid marketing ""aggregators"" can serve several clients simultaneously in the target market (thus lowering the cost for each individual firm) and are an option assuming no conflicts of interest between the aggregator's various clients. Other companies in Vietnam have pursued a ""somethingfor-nothing"" approach in which they work with a sales agent in the target country who takes a commission only on successful sales. Such arrangements give the Vietnamese firm less accountability over marketing efforts in the target country. Marketing partnerships and alliances are possible between Vietnamese firms and other offshore software provider firms from higher wage countries (such as India and to a lesser extent Thailand) as companies in those countries may seek their own cost cutting measures or access to talent to maintain client accounts. However, given the prevalent nature of proven on-site/offshore delivery models in software outsourcing, it's unlikely that such alliances can be distributed or formed from afar. Rather, they will require close integration and will likely require project management and team leaders to be resident full time in Vietnam. To look at the trend in regional alliances, consider the following: Five of the top six Indian firms are listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ and control more than half of the Indian outsourcing market. Many of these same firms (TCS, Infosys, Satyam, PCS and NIIT) are in the process of setting up a token presence in China to both tap that market and explore how it can be leveraged as an offshore base for Japanese and North Asian clients. Possibly in recognition of global risk concerns, companies such as Mascot and Satyam, have been asked by major North American clients to outsource 20% of their offshore work outside of India. Therefore, it is likely that these very same companies will come to Vietnam to invest, acquire, or partner with local companies in order to tap local talent as wage rate pressures increase in India. The value of industry clusters Numerous developing countries and regions strive to be the next Bangalore India or Silicon Valley USA. Yet studies reveal that most are falling short of their intended targets. The reason is that IT development initiatives focus on comparative advantages,  October 2002  11  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  such as low labor cost and attractive tax incentives without developing long term sustainable competitive advantage. A region's competitive advantage is largely determined by two interrelated factors: 1) The collaboration between IT companies, financial and insurance institutions, university or vocational educational centers, government policies and regulations, business and professional associations, and oversees marketing efforts towards a common strategic vision. 2) The region's ability to differentiate itself from its competitors. This is best accomplished by a clustering approach with a common strategic vision based on that area's uniqueness. Clusters offer the following advantages.         Increased productivity and innovation Better access to skilled employees and capable suppliers Improved brand imaging Access to specialized information One stop shopping for international customers Access to institutions and public goods Increased leverage over government policy Improved access to global distribution  Building and facilitating cluster development is an option that the Vietnam software cluster can consider to help develop a common strategic objective and to overcome obstacles to competitiveness. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Raising the standard and benchmarking with peers around the world Collectively, firms can improve the competitive landscape and Vietnam's chance to complete globally by jointly embracing and pursuing internationally accepted standards such as ISO and the CMM. Process improvement measures and mechanisms have become an increasingly important part of the software development process to ensure that quality meets global standards and that the industry is recognized for its capabilities and achievements. As international clients make decisions about where to outsource, these global standards are prerequisite to participating in the market. Many clients, especially those with years of experience in offshore outsourcing, have come to view CMM or ISO 9000 as a given, a minimum entry for any prospective supplier. -- Aberdeen Research, September 2002 The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Software was advanced by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) of Carnegie Mellon University, has wide international support and is a publicly sponsored program free to any company that wants to adopt it. The  October 2002  12  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  Capability Maturity Model describes the principles and practices underlying software process maturity and is intended to help software organizations improve the maturity of their software processes in terms of an evolutionary path from ad hoc, chaotic processes to mature, disciplined software processes. By implementing CMM companies reap many tangible benefits, reduce software development risk and increase predictability -- thus becoming a more attractive partner or supplier to customers from around the world. However, CMM does not come cost-free. Considerable company resources must be dedicated to addressing key process areas necessary to climb the CMM certification ladder. CMM outlines a series of levels to indicate achieved ""maturity"" with level 1 as the least mature and level 5 as the most mature. Recently, SEI has forwarded CMMi, a successor model to CMM and companies are beginning to explore use of this model as well.  Figure 1: Capability Maturity Model - Levels for Software Development  CMM further explained Except for Level 1, each maturity level is decomposed into several key process areas that indicate the areas an organization should focus on to improve its software process. The key process areas at Level 2 focus on the software project's concerns related to establishing basic project management controls. They are Requirements Management, Software Project Planning, Software Project Tracking and Oversight, Software Subcontract Management, Software Quality Assurance, and Software Configuration Management. The key process areas at Level 3 address both project and organizational issues, as the organization establishes an infrastructure that institutionalizes effective software engineering and management processes across all projects. They are Organization Process Focus, Organization Process Definition, Training Program, Integrated Software Management, Software Product Engineering, Intergroup Coordination, and Peer Reviews.  October 2002  13  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  The key process areas at Level 4 focus on establishing a quantitative understanding of both the software process and the software work products being built. They are Quantitative Process Management and Software Quality Management. The key process areas at Level 5 cover the issues that both the organization and the projects must address to implement continual, measurable software process improvement. They are Defect Prevention, Technology Change Management, and Process Change Management. Each key process area is described in terms of the key practices that contribute to satisfying its goals. The key practices describe the infrastructure and activities that contribute most to the effective implementation and institutionalization of the key process area. Characteristics of the 5 levels of CMM maturity: 1) Initial. The software process is characterized as ad hoc, and occasionally even chaotic. Few processes are defined, and success depends on individual effort and heroics. 2) Repeatable. Basic project management processes are established to track cost, schedule, and functionality. The necessary process discipline is in place to repeat earlier successes on projects with similar applications. 3) Defined. The software process for both management and engineering activities is documented, standardized, and integrated into a standard software process for the organization. All projects use an approved, tailored version of the organization's standard software process for developing and maintaining software. 4) Managed. Detailed measures of the software process and product quality are collected. Both the software process and products are quantitatively understood and controlled. 5) Optimizing. Continuous process improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback from the process and from piloting innovative ideas and technologies. In many ways, the state of the Vietnamese software industry today parallels the state of the manufacturing industry in Japan following World Ward II. In July of 1950, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) invited Dr. W. Edwards Deming to Japan to provide a series of lectures and seminars during which he taught the basic principles of quality control to executives, managers and engineers of Japanese industries. His teachings made a deep impression on the participants' minds and provided great impetus in implementing quality control in Japan. While in 1950s and 1960s, manufactured products from Japan were initially seen as low quality and inferior, by the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese products were globally competitive and known for high standards of quality.  October 2002  14  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  With a dedication to scholarship unmatched by many of its peer countries in the software industry, Vietnam could also become globally known as a quality producer of software if the same fervor that captured Japanese manufacturing with the teachings of Deming were to capture the Vietnamese software industry with the quality standards of CMM and ISO. Participation in Software Process Improvement Networks (SPIN) Chapters and close collaboration between industry participants to share knowledge on software process improvement best practices are friendly, non-competitive ways in which individual companies can raise the standards both within their companies and for the industry as a whole. Strategy summary for firms    Mechanisms are emerging to help firms overcome the initial investment hurdle of an international sales/marketing presence Collaboration in industry clusters may help firms overcome obstacles to competitiveness Collaboration between firms in process improvement, through programs such as CMM, may raise the competitiveness of the whole sector  PART II: ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY FOR GOVERNMENT AND POLICY MAKERS: Analysis for government and policy makers For government officials, policy makers, and other stakeholders seeking to support development of the sector, it's important that competitiveness promotion strategies are not contradictory to ICT development strategies for the country. Government can have a strong impact on shaping competitiveness of the sector by shaping factor conditions through, for example, training and infrastructure policies. Furthermore, government set regulatory standards, processes and procurement practices can have a great influence on domestic demand. A PEST/STEP analysis for Vietnam in the Software Sector As government officials, policy makers and other stakeholders evaluate how they can contribute to the sector's competitiveness, they must look beyond the challenges and key questions faced by individual firms and instead consider issues that affect all firms. One mechanism for making such an evaluation is through a ""PEST"" analysis. A PEST analysis is a country-specific analysis of quantitative and qualitative external macroenvironment that affects all firms. ""P.E.S.T."" is an acronym for the Political, Economic, Social, and Technological factors. These external factors are usually beyond the firm's control and often times present themselves as threats (hence the appropriate use of the term ""pest."") For optimists, changes in the external environment may create new opportunities so the letters can be  October 2002  15  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  re-arranged as a ""STEP"" analysis. Below is an analysis relevant for the software sector in Vietnam: PEST/STEP Analysis for Vietnam in the Software Sector Political Economic Economic system  pursuing integration Political stability  highly stable (+) with global system, improving (n) Risk of military invasion - low in contrast to countries such as India (+) Government intervention in the free market - moving away from central Legal framework for contract planning, improving (n) enforcement  under development (n) Intellectual property protection  weakest Exchange rate stability  stable (n) Efficiency of financial markets  fledgling in the world (-) stock market, very little venture capital (-) Favored trading partners  ratification of Infrastructure quality  poor and BTA with US puts country in more bandwidth expensive, but improving (n) favorable light with customers (n) Skill level of workforce  technically Taxation - tax incentives favorable for strong, managerially weak (+ and -) software companies (+) Labor costs  low (+) Wage legislation  minimum wage far below the threshold of sector standards (+) Economic growth rate  high (+) Unemployment rate  underemployment Regulations & tariffs  communications high (n) costs are prohibitively expensive but Comparative advantage as host country improving (-) image problem among potential client Work week  standard (n) companies and investors (-) Employee benefits  many left to Interest and inflation rate  stable (+) discretion to employers (n) Political support of the industry  emerging as a favored sector (+) Social Technological Recent technological developments  Demographics  young population, eager Limited installed technology base so to integrate with global economic Vietnam has opportunity to leapfrog other community (e.g. English language skills countries (+) highly popular among young) (+) Rate of technological diffusion  Poor Educational aptitude  literacy high, mechanisms for diffusing technology as education highly valued in culture (+) well as information mean decisions must Educational opportunity  poor, institutions not keeping pace with levels of often be made in ignorance (-) demand nor type of training demanded at tertiary levels (-) Entrepreneurial spirit  high, profitable sectors see many new entrants (+) Information sharing - information guarded, not shared.

In practice, individual firms cannot be expected to change these factors so they must prioritize and monitor those that most influence the industry. For government, policy makers, and other stakeholders, the challenge is to determine which of the factors can be addressed for the benefit of all firms participating in the industry. While changing a (-) negative to a (+) positive in the PEST/STEP analysis might have profoundly positive benefits across many sectors and many industries in the Vietnamese economy, the action required to make the change may entail the participation of diverse decision makers and diverse interests. For example, reducing communication charges to international standards might require the input of VNPT, the Office of Government, the Finance Ministry and others; strengthening IP laws and enforcement, MOSTE and the Ministry of Justice; opening up tertiary education to additional providers, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Planning and Investment. The number of configurations of overlapping authorities required to address individual areas of competitiveness is as diverse as the macro-environmental factors affecting the sector. Ministries, agencies, and other stakeholders that cannot change macro-economic factors alone must first invest effort into consensus building exercises before meaningful change can follow. Vietnam's position Vs. competing countries in the software sector As identified in the earlier section of this report, the most compelling market opportunities are global and in the provision of software services. India is the leader but China is often raised as a potential up-and-coming competitor. In terms of scale, the following chart indicates the quantitative distinctions between these giants and Vietnam. Vietnam compared to global leaders (2001 figures) China India Vietnam Software Exports $850 million $6,200 million $21 million Domestic software sales $4,300 million $2,060 million $50 million * Growth rate - domestic software + 55% + 31% NA sales Current IT Professionals 150,000 522,000 20,000 * Demand for IT Professionals 350,000 400,000 Growing IT Professionals Graduating 50,000 73,218 4,000 Each Year Number of Software Companies 6,000+ 3,000+ 300+ Note: China and India statistics from Far Eastern Economic Review, September 2002 * unofficial and estimated However, the differences in scale do not mean that Vietnam cannot compete in the outsourcing services market or cannot serve as an alternative to the undisputed leader, India. In discussions with multinational companies experienced in both China and India, there is a consistent theme. Although the Chinese talent pool is much larger than that of Vietnam and the Chinese firms are starting to aggressively pursue quality certification such as CMM, most MNCs see the rapid growth rate in domestic demand in the Chinese  October 2002  17  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  market as absorbing most of the available talent and resources. In fact, Indian companies have been stepping up their efforts to place workers on site and set up operations in China to meet demand in the Chinese market. Although Chinese companies and Chinese government officials publicize their desire to become a major offshore software destination, China should not be considered head-head competition for global outsourcing software projects as wage rates in China are already higher than those in Vietnam, as China does not have the inherent advantages over Vietnam as India (e.g. natural fluency in English), and many firms utilizing China cite their stake in the Chinese domestic market as influencing their decision to develop software there. When companies look to offshore software outsourcing alternatives to India or China, the most frequently mentioned countries are Ireland and Russia and to a lesser extent, countries in Eastern Europe, Malaysia, Mexico, and the Philippines. Analysis summary for government/policy makers    The PEST analysis helps identify areas where the Vietnam can make changes to improve its competitiveness Changing macro-economic factors may first require consensus building since overlapping authorities may be required to effect change on key factors Due to scale, Vietnam is not positioned to ""dominate"" the software outsourcing services market but is positioned to participate fully in this market  Strategy for government and policy makers From a strategic perspective, the correct role of the state in the economy can be controversial. There are examples of successful intervention helping to boost economic development, but there are just as many counter-examples of the government interfering, distorting the market, and diverting resources away from where they are best used. The need for governments to ""do something"" must be matched by equivalent constraint not to do ""too much."" Because of lead times involved before the impact of government actions are felt, governments must anticipate and put in place ahead of time the infrastructure, institutions and policies needed for the next level of competition. However, moving too far ahead of firms' strategies and capabilities will not only deprive them of the types of inputs and supporting conditions they really need, but confuse and demoralize them. Therefore, a careful balance must always be sought. State intervention in the software sector Strategically, there are numerous types of state intervention which can affect the competitiveness of firms operating within its borders. Generically, these might include:   Targeted loans Export incentives  October 2002  18  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market           Import restrictions Government procurement Public ownership Tax breaks Investment subsidies R&D subsidies Funneling of international donor resources Human resource development  In the same way that the PEST/STEP analysis reveals that overlapping authority affects a country's ability to make factor changes, overlapping authority may also be responsible for these ""tools"" of state intervention. Therefore, a key challenge for responsible government/policy makers is to find the right match between the factors identified in the PEST/STEP analysis against the generic tools of state intervention. Setting priorities  the big picture strategy In the recently released World Bank ICT assessment for Vietnam, it stated that: ""Developing the ICT sector, especially software assembly and development, is useful in creating jobs, but can have relatively little useful spillover into the general society unless it is part of a larger development strategy."" It later went on to conclude that Vietnam should focus attention on:   Developing the IT industry as an enabler of development in all sectors Developing the IT industry primarily for domestic consumption and secondarily for export  While the first recommendation can be mutually implemented with many other strategies, the second is a strategy of mutual exclusivity and may ignore the larger benefits of a successfully developed software export strategy in Vietnam. One of the most debilitating and competitive disadvantages for Vietnam has been decades of relative isolation from the world economic community. Vietnam will only become competitive if it can increase its integrative capacity with the global economic community and there are few better sectors to lead such integration than software. In software development, response to client requirements are inherent in the work, international interaction is direct, and there is minimal interference by other domestic concerns. Therefore, in contrast to other sectors of the Vietnamese economy, the software export sector is well positioned to become successfully and rapidly integrated into the global economic system. The demonstration effect, as well as the impact of actual integration, could ""pull"" along other sectors as well. If Vietnam implements explicit policy measures to primarily develop the IT and software for domestic consumption, potential negative consequences include: October 2002 19 Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market       The industry will remain globally isolated Opportunity costs will be incurred by ignoring global market trends and drivers Vietnam's integrative capacity through an important sector could be lost (project management skills, quality assurance skills, English language skills, other skills essential to participate in the global economy de-emphasized) Companies successful at domestic procurement will not have the skills required to sell internationally  However, the World Bank report does highlight the fact that the industry can be developed and for government and policy makers seeking to exert influence, strategic use of government procurement may be a tool immediately available. Creating a domestic market that logically connects to global trends Open source and free software as a strategic alternative The software products found in the Vietnamese market mirror those found in many countries in the world. BEA application servers, Oracle databases, and Windows operating systems are found running on servers and PCs throughout the country. The key distinction between the installed software base in Vietnam and that of most other countries in the world is the fact that most software in Vietnam is pirated. In fact, Vietnam has the dubious ""honor"" of winning the world's worst offender award year after year. The 10 countries with the highest piracy rates are (in rank order): 2000 2001 Vietnam 97% 94% China 94% 92% Indonesia 89% 88% Ukraine/Other CIS 89% 87% Russia 88% 87% Pakistan 83% 83% Lebanon 83% 79% Qatar 81% 78% Nicaragua 78% 78% Bolivia 81% 77% Source: Business Software Alliance's (BSA) seventh annual benchmark survey on global software piracy. For a country trying to attract high tech investment, foster a domestic market, and create an image that will attract offshore outsourcing clients, the ""top"" ranking designation is extremely harmful. Such rankings lead to damaging headlines in worldwide news journals and highlight Vietnam's problem (e.g. Headline: ""Pirate's heaven in Vietnam"" Article: Business 2.0, February 18, 2002).  October 2002  20  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  Critics of these reports point out that software companies often fail to offer differentiated pricing structures for lower income countries. Given such wide disparity in GDP income levels and differences in purchasing power, it is understandable  and some argue acceptable  that piracy is so rampant in a country such as Vietnam. Consider the retail purchase price of standard Windows XP operating system and office suite and compare that to per capita GDP for an individual in Vietnam. The cost of Windows XP is 127% per capita GDP! A per capita price equivalent for someone in the US wanting to purchase such software would set the price at US$38,436. Cost equivalent of software based on country GDP* Approximate Cost (Retail May 2002) Windows XP OS+OP Standard Windows XP OS+OP Professional $560 $800 Cost as % of Vietnam GDP p.c.

Such approaches and arguments are counterproductive at a time when Vietnam is trying to integrate with the global economic system. Adopting international norms and standards are necessary to Vietnam's success so it is critical that Vietnam work toward IPR regulations and enforcement. Positive steps have been taken with the drafting of intellectual property laws (with WIPO - World Intellectual Property Organization assistance). However, even after appropriate laws are on the books, enforcement -- which can be costly -- will be required. Therefore, Vietnam should consider creative strategies to achieve its integration goals without losing access to important software technologies. Open source and free software The open source and free software movements are supported by leading multinationals including IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard, are gaining worldwide momentum from developer communities, and could have a profoundly positive impact on Vietnam. By embracing open source and free software and encouraging local adoption through government procurement and other mechanisms, Vietnam could accomplish many objectives:  Remain compliant with intellectual property regulation and international standards  October 2002  21  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market      Reduce the cost of software used in government offices, government companies, and the educational system Create demand for a local industry which connects Vietnam to global trends Create a reputation and ""brand"" for which Vietnam could become recognized  What is open source? ""Open Source"" software can be very complex notion but a simplistic explanation is that the open source embodies the principle where source code is freely distributed and accessible to various types of re-use and modification. Various licensing schemes determine the level of freedom upon which the code can be used. The table below gives a comparison of open source licensing practices: License GPL LGPL BSD NPL MPL Public Domain Can be mixed with non-free software Modifications can be taken private and not returned to you Can be re-licensed by anyone Contains special privileges for the original copyright holder over your modifications  No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  No No Yes Yes Yes Yes  No No No No No Yes  No No No Yes No No  For most core computer applications available on the market today, there is a free or open source equivalent which can meet similar needs. The table below shows proprietary software applications and the open source alternatives.

Source: Adapted from Business 2.0  August 2002  Productivity Software Spreadsheet Web Browser Web Server  Microsoft Office Microsoft Excel Microsoft Internet Explorer Microsoft IIS  OpenOffice Gnumeric Mozilla Apache  Given the plethora of choices, widespread deployment of open source software does not limit capability in the sector but instead provides important benefits for Vietnam. Open source provides costs savings The potential cost savings of deploying open source software are significant as examples illustrate. Consider the following: many email and server functions for an office of 25 people could be supported by a low-end server (Intel Pentium III processor and 128MB of memory) and the cost of the server with associated software looks like this: No operating system ~ about $2,400 With Red Hat Linux ~ about $2,600 With Windows 2000 Advanced Server ~ about $5,600 Consider the cost of Microsoft XP + Office (US$500+) against the cost of OpenOffice (free). Imagine the cost involved if every PC in the Vietnamese educational system had a licensed copy of Windows Office  such costs would be prohibitive. There are alternatives. An initial version of Open Office has been localized by one Vietnamese company and there is a small but growing contingent of programmers that are working on localization of other open source software products. In addition to the raw cost savings on software, open source operating systems and programs can operate on simpler hardware platforms thus reducing the bill for the type of hardware required to run such applications. Acting locally but thinking globally in creation of the domestic market Government and policy makers could encourage the adoption and demand for open source and free software through strategic inclusion as part of government procurement practices. Deployment of open source software moves the costs associated with maintenance and upgrading of software away from procurement of bundled and proprietary releases and toward skill intensive activities likely to come from local input  thus increasing market demand for systems integrations specialists and application developers  but not at the cost of isolating these IT specialists and software developers from their international peers.  October 2002  23  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  Open source software is developed collaboratively and often through de-centralized mechanisms by software engineers all over the world, so participation in this movement will give Vietnamese developers the chance to highlight their skills with peers from around the globe. Finally, as Vietnamese developers become increasingly known for domain level expertise on open source applications, there could be increased interest by MNCs to utilize Vietnam as a source of offshore software development and services contracts for projects with open source components. As noted in the previous section ""technical capability"" ranks highly in the buyer's selection process. Create a positive reputation and ""brand"" for which Vietnam could become recognized Vietnam is currently known among the worldwide software community as the worst IPR offender in terms of software piracy. Vietnam has an opportunity to turn the spotlight of negative attention into positive press. The small country of Peru made international headlines when it announced that all public IT procurements would require free and open source software applications. Although leaders in the open source movement have cautioned against legislating technical specifications, much attention has been focused on Peru for their willingness to pursue such a strategy. A carefully crafted public relations campaign for the Vietnamese software sector combined with widespread adoption of progressive policies on open source could quickly shift the focus of attention on Vietnam away from piracy and onto the positive role that Vietnam might play in the worldwide open source movement. CASE: Peru's bold moves: In November 2001, a Bill (Number 1609) was presented before the Peruvian Congress by Peruvian Congressman Dr. Edgar David Villanueva Nuez. In summary, this Bill states that all areas of the Peruvian government would be required to make use of open source software (with the term strictly defined within the bill) except in cases where a mature enough open source project is not available. The Bill only affects the government's systems and does not restrict commercial entities from participating, as long as the software they offer is open source--or for educational institutions that may require some particular proprietary software for research or other purposes. Strategy summary for government/policy makers    The states has numerous tools at its disposal to affect the competitiveness of firms in the software sector Vietnam must be careful to set the correct priorities and developing the software sector for export could have lasting benefits Widespread adoption of Open source and free software could have profoundly positive benefits for Vietnam  October 2002  24  Kenan Institute Asia   Vietnam's emerging software industry: Competitiveness, positioning, and strategy in a global market  CONCLUSION Modern day business theorists and practitioners advance the concept that a nation's wealth is principally of its own collective choosing. How a nation and its citizens choose to organize and manage the economy, the institutions they put in place and the types of investments they individually and collectively choose to make will determine national prosperity. The software sector is important for Vietnam's prosperity and development and the challenges facing the software sector in Vietnam are similar to those facing the sectors of many industries in Vietnam. As Vietnam continues the process of integration into the global economic community, companies must learn to compete against companies located in other countries. In contrast to mature sectors with slower growth rates, the global software sector continues to grow rapidly and presents unique opportunities for Vietnam. The industry has both competitive and comparative advantages over other countries. Through careful development and positioning of the software sector, the software industry can make strategic choices now which will set the stage for Vietnam's competitiveness for generations to come. Some of the most compelling opportunities for Vietnam will surface in four to five years time so industry stakeholders should anticipate these opportunities and work both individually and collectively, under a common vision, to realize these opportunities for the benefit for all.

Nowhere has that been more evident lately than in the illegal pyramid          schemes that have surfaced in the Commonwealth. Although the specifics          may vary, pyramid schemes have a few things in common that are unlawful.         In          recent months, my Bureau of Consumer Protection has uncovered several          of these illegal scams, which often lure otherwise law-abiding citizens          into illegal activity with the promise of large returns on small investments.          In the past, pyramid scheme promoters often used a product as a tool to          market their plan. In the latest wave of schemes to hit the Commonwealth,          the pyramid schemes are disguised as charitable investments. Called ""gifting          programs,"" they have names like ""World of Giving"" or ""Sharing Equally.""          New members contribute several thousands of dollars to recruiters, claiming          no expectation of a return. However, those members then are responsible          for recruiting new members, thereby profiting from their initial ""gift"".          The fact that many are brought into the pyramid scheme by coworkers, friends          and neighbors makes the program seem even more legitimate. Nothing could          be farther from the truth.         No          matter what they are called, pyramid schemes are illegal in all 50 states.          It is also important to realize that anyone who participates in a pyramid          plan is breaking the law. Because those who recruit consumers to invest          in a pyramid scheme are adamant that their ""investment plan"" or ""gifting          program"" is not a pyramid or illegal multilevel marketing plan, it's important          you know what to look for so that you won't fall victim. Here are some          ""red flags"" that mark a pyramid scheme:                   Money is made by recruiting            distributors or investors.            Your initial investment            buys you the right to recruit others for profit.           You are promised quick,            lucrative rewards for recruiting others.           There is high pressure to            join or ""buy-in"" immediately.           Recruitment meetings rely            heavily on ""testimonials"" from members.           Exchange of money is carried            out in person or by private carrier; use of the US Postal Service is            strictly prohibited.                 By          their very nature, pyramid schemes are doomed to fail. They rely on huge          numbers of people to get involved in the program in order for ""investors""          to get their money, which is virtually impossible. In one such pyramid,          some members would need to recruit more than two million people in order          to see the return they expect.         My          Bureau of Consumer Protection is working hard to shut down all of the          pyramid schemes in Pennsylvania, but your good sense will go a long way          in helping the Office of Attorney General protect you.

GX022-83-12347741	"Statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein on FERC's Findings of Widespread          Fraud and Manipulation in California's Energy Crisis                    March 26, 2003                     ""The          Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today announced that its investigation          of the 2000-2001 Western Energy Crisis found that energy companies had          deliberately manipulated electricity and natural gas markets.                    FERC also          announced that California would likely receive more than $3.3 billion          in refunds, although according to FERC California still owes $3 billion          for unpaid electricity, so the net result might not be so great.                    FERC ordered          more than 30 energy companies and municipal utilities to turn over unjust          profits unless they counter the evidence uncovered in the investigation          and prove that they did not engage in market manipulation. This could          dramatically boost the refund to California.                    Most significantly,          FERC charged four energy companies - Enron Power Marketing, Enron Energy          Services, Reliant Energy Services and BP Energy Company - of engaging          in market manipulation that could now result in loss of their authority          to charge free-market rates.                    FERC is          also considering banning eight Enron connected gas companies from selling          natural gas in California: Bridgeline Gas Marketing, Citrus Trading Corp.,          ENA Upstream Co., Enron and Enron Canada Corp., Enron Compression Services          Co., Enron Energy Services Inc., Enron MW, LLC, and Enron North America          Corp.                   The          regulatory hammer has finally begun to drop. The question now is how hard.          FERC needs to do much more to ensure that the people and businesses of          California are adequately compensated for their financial losses and hardships          during the energy crisis.                              California has requested a total of nearly $9 billion in refunds and provided          significant documentation of the widespread fraud and manipulation to          back up its claim. In view of the inflated profits that energy companies          realized at the expense of California homeowners and businesses - FERC          should right this wrong and honor California's claim.                             FERC is still reviewing California's request to open up to renegotiation          $43 billion in long-term contracts signed at the height of the crisis.          But I have been told that the Commission may be reluctant to take this          step because they fear setting a precedent. I do not believe this would          be a precedent, because the contracts were entered into under extraordinary          circumstances with rates inflated by market manipulation, and I believe          failure to open up the contracts would be a big mistake .                    Based on          the evidence that I have reviewed, which documents a coordinated attempt          by energy companies to manipulate the Western energy market, I am also          urging U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate fraud and anti-trust          violations during the energy crisis. The documents submitted to FERC by          the State of California, the California Attorney General and the State's          largest utilities, provide significant evidence that there was a concerted          effort to boost company profits at the expense of consumers. Let me describe          some of the highlights:                     First, the          documents detail new incidents when energy companies intentionally held          their plants offline to drive prices up.                             For instance,            these documents show that Reliant failed to return its plant near Santa            Barbara to service for two days after repairs were completed on January            26, 2001 -- even though the State was experiencing Stage 3 emergencies.                                          Additionally,            on August 15, 2000, Williams reported that its Alamitos 7 plant in Long            Beach was unavailable due to pollution limitations -- but another company's            logs from that day show the plant was shut down because Williams directed            it to be.                                      Second, we          found pages and pages of transcripts that show energy traders were deliberately          attempting to manipulate the Western market - frequently through strategies          earlier Enron memos termed ""Death Star,"" ""Get Shorty,"" ""Fat Boy,"" and          ""Ricochet,"" among others.                    The transcripts          show these strategies were implemented not just by Enron, but by energy          companies across the board. Here are just a few examples:                             A conversation            between a Mirant trader and a trader from Public Service of Colorado            reveals a joint effort to engage in overscheduling energy, the ""Fat            Boy"" strategy.                                        The trader          from Public Service of Colorado states, ""Why don't we just do something          where we overschedule, overschedule load and share an upside, dude."" The          Mirant trader responds, ""That's fine.""                             Additionally,            Reliant had ""camouflage transactions"" where the company sold power out            of California day-ahead to Arizona and New Mexico utilities, and bought            it back for sale (at a much higher price) in California. This was known            in the Enron memos as the ""Ricochet"" strategy.                                       These were          not isolated incidents. They were widely implemented practices designed          to fleece consumers in the West.                    Third, the          documents lay out new evidence of possible anti-trust violations by energy          companies. The filing shows the largest energy suppliers in California          shared non-public information through a third-party company called Industrial          Information Resources. Traders called this company ""The Mole.""                    Industrial          Information Resources provided sellers detailed, non-public information          on daily plant outages - essentially giving energy companies insider information          on when an unplanned outage could transform an energy shortage into a          Stage 3 energy emergency or blackout.                    Fourth,          the documents provide new evidence of document destruction by energy companies          to cover up details of their actions.          In the documents,          an ex-Mirant employee disclosed that:                   He was            instructed to delete certain files relating to the California markets            from hard drives; and           Key Mirant            executives were instructed to turn in their laptops so that Mirant could            clear their hard drives.                                  According          to this employee, he was ordered to flagrantly destroy documents, which          may have detailed market fraud. This means that we will never know the          true scope of the gaming and manipulation.                    I strongly          believe this type of fraud and manipulation occurred, in part, because          strong federal oversight of the energy trading system was non-existent.                              To help          remedy that, Senators Fitzgerald, Harkin, Lugar, Cantwell, Wyden, Leahy,          Boxer, Durbin, and I have introduced the Energy Market Oversight Act --          to help ensure that the energy crisis in the West will never be repeated.                              The legislation          would provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) full anti-fraud          and anti-manipulation authority over all online and bilateral energy trades.          These trades currently take place with no transparency, no record keeping,          no audit trail, and no federal oversight to guard against fraud and manipulation.          It would also give FERC greater authority to investigate and prevent fraud          and price manipulation.                     Despite          the clear evidence of fraud and manipulation, FERC and CFTC have done          little to punish the energy companies -- frequently letting the companies          off with just a slap on the wrist. This sends the wrong message to the          industry and increases the likelihood of additional manipulation in the          future.          But by passing          this legislation, Congress would send a strong message to the energy industry          that fraud and manipulation will not be tolerated. It has been more than          two years since the energy crisis began in California. It is time to bring          the necessary oversight to the energy market.""         ###"

The objective of the study is to glean possible strategic and tactical concepts and practices that could apply to Bangladesh and its goal to increase its potential in this market. 1.2 Major Findings  The Philippines consistently lags behind its Asian neighbors in development, with long-running problems such as overpopulation, political instability and natural disasters. In recent years, however, due to major reforms in its telecommunications infrastructure, the Information Technology and IT-Enabled Services sectors of the economy have demonstrated noticeable growth. With declining telecommunications costs and the country's inherent strengths in its English-speaking and service-oriented labor force, the country recognized its competitive potential in serving the American and English-speaking market for outsourcing. Based on an articulated strategy by the IT and E-Commerce Council (ITECC), a partnership organization composed of public and private sector representatives, the Philippines began to focus on its unique advantages and to target specific ITES segments in which to compete. While still facing internal risks and threats from other countries vying for market share, the Philippines has demonstrated organization and strategy from which to work towards its goals of creating highervalue jobs and increasing exports.  2  Why the Philippines for ITES Competitiveness Study  As recently stated in the Asian Wall Street Journal, ""It is not often that the Philippines and the notion of competitiveness appear in the same sentence.""1 The article goes on to state that the country has recently caught the attention of major companies around the world as a supplier of IT-Enabled Services (ITES). Competitor countries like India are taking notice as well. As the subject of competitor country research, the Philippines became a logical choice among others because of its recent advances in key areas that foster its emerging ITES industry. While India has held a commanding lead for years, the Philippines is only now showing its capabilities in various areas of ITES  and has been actively promoting 1  Population Literacy GDP per capita % of population below poverty line Labor force Unemployment  Bangladesh 131.3M 56% $1,570 36%  Philippines 82.8M 95% $3,800 41%  64.1M 35%  48.1M 10%  Source: CIA World Factbook 2001  ""The Philippine Advantage: On electronic services, Manila finally is doing something right,"" Michael Alan Hamlin, Asia Wall Street Journal, 20 March 2002. 1  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study its unique competitive advantages to the international market. Its emerging position as a country supplier was deemed to be more relevant to Bangladesh's early efforts in establishing an ITES industry. Lastly, the Philippines shares with Bangladesh a few less favorable factors  including a poor country image, low GDP per capita, population density and unpredictable political shifts. 2.1 Country's Competitive Position in ITES  In NASSCOM/McKinsey's recent ITES study, the Philippines ranked low in both ""Country Attractiveness"" and ""Capability of Workers"": India and Ireland have emerged as particularly attractive locations for IT-Enabled Services  If Bangladesh was included in the country comparison in this report2, it would similarly be positioned in the lower left quadrant of this map, i.e. with low Country Attractiveness and low Capability of Workers.  2  NASSCOM McKinsey, ""The India I.T. Advantage,"" December 1999. The country comparison matrix used here has subjective and arbitrary elements in deciding where countries are positioned along the axes. Additionally, there have been shifts in the country competitive landscape since 1999. It is used here as a guide and starting point for analysis, not as factual basis for considering country competitiveness. However, general conclusions from this matrix, i.e. the relative positions of the Philippines and Bangladesh as country suppliers, are considered relevant for illustrative purposes. 2  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study  3  Key Enabling Factors for ITES  The public and private sectors of the Philippines have made significant advances in creating a more favorable and optimal location for IT and IT-Enabled Services. These positive effects are becoming more evident, in terms of increased employment and foreign investment, although the country is still in the early stages of finding its competitive niche in the market. 3.1 3.1.1 Infrastructure Telecommunications Industry Reform  The telecommunications infrastructure in the Philippines had been controlled by a privately-held monopoly operating as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, founded in 1928. While majority-owned by the powerful Lopez family, PLDT had a small amount of shares traded publicly on the Philippine Stock Exchange, but nonetheless the monopoly over land lines and the international gateway was a tremendous challenge to the access and affordability of telephones in the country. In 1993, then President Fidel Ramos embarked on a campaign to practice more openmarket policies in heavy industries including the power grid, oil and gas, and telecommunications. He is widely recognized as having provided the political will to break the monopoly of the PLDT by issuing two Presidential Orders which greatly increased the availability of telephone lines:   Executive Order 59: mandated interconnection between PLDT and other telecom operators Executive Order 109: increased the number of lines; any company applying for a telecommunications license must construct 300,000 international or 400,000 mobile lines within three years3  The effects of the telecommunications industry reform were seen soon after these mandates from the President. In addition, it is reported that significant foreign investment began to flow into the country after these policies were put into place, although a specific figure was not readily attributable to the reform. 3.1.2 Teledensity and Internet Use  Signs of liberalization of the telecommunications industry began to appear in the midto late 1990's, with increased competition, increased investment, and reduced rates. The following table is from data supplied by the National Telecommunications Commission: 3  Philippine Institute for Developmental Studies, ""Liberalization and Regional Integration: the Philippines' Strategy for Global Competitiveness"" 3  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study  Land Lines Teledensity  fixed lines Wireless Wireless density Internet users  1995 1.4M 2.01 959k ('96) 1.37 100,000 ('97)  2000 6.9M 9.05 6.5M 8.46 2,000,000  % change 393% 350% 578% 517% 1,900%  The significant and rapid increase in teledensity, wireless density and internet use is clear evidence that the open-market policies of the Ramos administration quickly took hold. Once the government liberalized the telecommunications infrastructure, market forces stepped in to meet demand. 3.1.3 Competition and Service  Soon after liberalization reform, penetration and availability of telecommunications service increased in direct relation to the increase from the one provider, PLDT, to many more. Operators Local exchange carriers International Gateway Facilities Public Trunk Line Operators Cellular Mobile Telephone Carriers Satellite Services # in 2000 77 11 10 5 13  Source: National Telecommunications Commission It is important to note, however, that although there are numerous local exchange carriers, PLDT still controls 80% of the market.4 Another effect of increased providers and competition is the decline in prices over the period. In 2000, for example, the average cost of a T1 line5 was reported to be $35,000 to $40,000 per month6. In 2002, this figure was quoted to be as low as $6,000 per month.7 Moreover, service has become more responsive; a company can obtain a T1 line within two days of placing its order. Companies also have their choice of connectivity  whether by T1, microwave or coaxial cable. These increased options significantly assist a typical ITES company, where data operations redundancy could be critical to the business.  4 5 6 7  Japanese Institute for Overseas Investment, ""Telecommunications in Asia"" Capacity of T1 = 64 kbps times 24 Board of Investments publication, ""Asia's IT Services Hub"" Interview with Undersecretary of Board of Investments, Gregorio Domingo, March 2002 4  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study  3.2 3.2.1  Human Capacity Labor Force, Literacy and Skills  The Philippines possesses a large labor force of over 33 million people. The country chronically suffers from high unemployment rate, approximately 11%, and many are underemployed even as a large number of citizens seek work overseas. The country has one of the highest literacy rates in Asia, 94.8%, as well as a high English language proficiency obtained by following an American-style public school system that teaches English in primary through secondary schools. The country produces 350,000 college graduates annually, including a large number of graduates in engineering, accounting and medical-related fields. The number of graduates in IT related programs illustrate an exponential growth, from 4,000 in 1991 to over 21,000 in 1999. 3.2.2 International Benchmarks  The country's educational system, along with IT training institutes that have spawned nationwide, have begun to encourage measurement of IT programs and students against international standards. Specifically, the government, in conjunction with Japanese company partners, has sponsored voluntary testing of Philippine graduates in fields of IT and animation using the standards exercised in Japan. Early results show Filipinos lagging behind their Japanese counterparts, and educators and company managers are at least now aware of this gap in order to intervene. For project management, private companies are encouraging employees to take the Singapore Project Management exam to assess their capabilities. IT training institutes are expected to be certified training vendors by the software or hardware developer (e.g. Oracle, Cisco), and to produce certified graduates as well. The University of the Philippines is also conducting its own study of how the UP curriculum and standards compare with North American counterparts. The country has also been recognized recently by international groups for its skilled labor force. The Hong-Kong based Political & Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) in 1999 ranked the Philippines second in its Skilled Labor Ranking, in terms of quality, cost and availability.8 3.2.3 ""Cultural Affinity"" with the USA  An unquantifiable attribute of the Filipino labor force is what has been termed its ""cultural affinity"" with the United States. As a former protectorate of the U.S. for over forty years, the Filipino culture is permeated with American attributes  such as language (including colloquialism), entertainment, and consumer goods and tastes. With this quality, the Philippine government and private sector has eyed the American 8  As quoted by the Board of Investments; the PERC report was not readily found after a search on the Internet 5  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study market as its primary target for ITES business, and is determined to feature this affinity as a competitive advantage of the Philippines. 3.2.4 Concerns  The Philippines faces the usual challenges of a developing nation in terms of the lack of resources for educational facilities and faculty, and the desire of many graduates to leave the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere. 3.2.5 Assessment  With regards to the ITES industry, the Philippines has the following positive factors in its labor force:     High literacy rate High fluency in English Cultural affinity to North America Large population with good primary education  The country also faces the following constraints or limitations:     Students and highly skilled workers want to leave Difficulty recruiting/retaining qualified faculty University level education under-funded Low supply of higher-level managers, e.g. project or relationship managers, necessary for higher value-added services  In relation to IT-Enabled Services, the most promising segments for the country given its current labor pool are the low- and mid-level segments of the industry. The country's leadership appears to recognize that it must increase the capabilities of IT and computer science graduates in order to participate in the higher end of the market. There are concerted efforts being done by the public and private sectors to bridge the gap identified by the international tests, although these programs are still under discussion at the time of writing. 3.3 Public & Private Sector Partnership: IT E-Commerce Council  During interviews with public and private sector stakeholders, many provided insight into the potential and contributions of the IT E-Commerce Council (ITECC). The organization combines the political muscle of government officials, with the expertise of the private sector. It should be noted, however, that (from interviews with stakeholders) there was wide agreement that the government was slow to react at first in focusing on the potential of IT and ITES. It was due to repeated requests from private sector IT organizations that finally gained the attention of government officials who eventually provided the political determination to get organized and formulate a strategic approach. This section provides detailed discussion on this subject because the organization and early activities of the ITECC appear to demonstrate the committee members'  6  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study understanding of the ITES industry, along with the competitive ""drive"" for the country to achieve its business goals. 3.3.1 ITECC Leadership and Organization  The ITECC falls under the Department of Trade and Industry, and is headed by an Executive Director who holds a Cabinet-level post under the President. The Committee is headed by the President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who has been credited for her focus on the economy (she was an economist and former member of Congress). ITECC members report that she indeed chairs the committee's monthly (now quarterly) meetings, driving the agenda with her political promise to create over 100,000 high-value jobs by the end of 2002.9 The Executive Committee under the President is composed of the Secretaries of the Department of Trade & Industry (DTI) and the Department of Science & Technology (DST), plus the Executive Director. The Executive Committee is tasked with policymaking and planning for the rest of ITECC. There are many working sub-committees, including Infrastructure, Human Resources, Business Development, e-Government, and Marketing and Communications. The sub-committees are each co-chaired with a government official and a volunteer member of the private sector. The Business Development Committee, for example, is co-chaired by the Undersecretary of the DTI and the Chief Information Officer of one of the largest Filipino-owned conglomerates in the country. The Human Resources Committee is co-chaired by the Department Chairman for Computer Science in the University of the Philippines school system and the founder of one of the largest chain of computer training schools. This arrangement, demonstrating a public and private sector partnership, appears to be working well for the ITECC in terms of aligning the goals of the public and private sectors organizationally.

As written on the Board of Investments website, the committee set out to develop focused market plan where Filipinos ""can compete initially and immediately"" in the ITES industry, specifically by maximizing inherent advantages of human resources. In principle, the ITECC believes that the government's role is to provide support in infrastructure, labor, financial, logistical and legal/institutional means. However, development of the sector should be left to the private sector  that technology and markets are ""inherently ungovernable"" and best if ""left to do its thing"". There are plans approved by Congress to create a new Department of Information, Communication & Technology under which the ITECC activities would fall. This move would separate ""Communications"" from the current Department of Transportation & Communications, and demonstrates the government's perspective of ICT as a separate infrastructure backbone for the country. With its own budget and staff, the belief is that there would be an increase in ICT research and program capabilities. The intent is also to align under one department the objectives and activities for infrastructure, labor and policies for business development of ICT. The Committee is admittedly still in its early organizational stages. Future activities for the ITECC are being developed into a written ""management plan"" (complete with objectives, tasks and delivery dates, and funding proposals for donor presentations) with the assistance of the USAID Mission in Manila, which is providing management consulting assistance to the Committee and Executive Director.  4  Selected Market Segments and Competitive Advantages  The ITECC recently developed its plan to concentrate on five specific segments in which it believed the Philippines could claim unique competitive advantages. The general criteria for choosing the segments were:     Market potential Employment potential  job creation Supply of knowledge workers Unique competitive advantages of the country o Education  accounting, medical-related, art o English speaking proficiency o ""Cultural affinity"" with USA In addition to low costs (""Value for Money""  up to 50% savings), time difference    8  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study The selected segments are:      4.1 Customer Contact/Call Centers Medical Transcriptions Animation Software Development Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)  specifically for financial services Selected Segments  The following provides a general overview of what ITECC has published to be the targeted ITES segments in which the Philippines wants to compete and attract overseas customers. Note the unique competitive advantages provided, which appear to be the anchors of the ITECC's strategy. Of these segments, the Gartner Group has assessed the Call Center and Business Processing Outsourcing areas as particularly promising for the Philippines.10 4.1.1    Customer Contact/Call Centers Market size: $6.5 billion worldwide in 1998; projected $33 billion in 2008 o Philippines: $173 million in revenues for 2001 o Projected growth to $864 million by 2004 Employment o 22 call centers with 3,600 agent seats; employed 4800 in 2001 o Projected growth to 24,000 jobs in 2004 Unique competitive advantages o High English proficiency  written and spoken, even with American colloquialism o Culture inclined towards customer service o Familiarity with American customer o Decreasing telecommunications costs Companies: America OnLine, Customer Contact Center (C-Qube) Medical Transcriptions Global market estimated at $10 to $25 billion annually; growth rate of 15% o Market expected to surge as 6,700 U.S. hospitals have yet to convert records as required o $40 million generated by Philippine MT firms in 2001 o Projected revenues to $483 million in 2004 Employment o 16 firms in 2001  4 have majority of market; 1,200 professionals Supply of knowledge workers o Philippines is #1 exporter of nurses o 220 medical schools 11   4.1.2      10  Based on interview with Josie Gonzalez, CITEM Director for IT and Electronics.

Growth is projected to be at 68% annually, to an industry size of $1.65 billion in 2004. This figure amounts to about 18% of what India has projected for its ITES exports of $9 billion in revenues by 2004.16  5 5.1  Role of Government Perceptions of Stakeholders  During interviews, key stakeholders from the public and private sectors were asked what they believed the appropriate role of the government should be in promoting the ITES industry. The following were the most common remarks on what the government could do:  Provide opportunities for local firms for e-government projects o Currently, there is a government ""E-procurement"" project in progress (CIDA funded) that has been sent for bid to local IT development firms o The government has already collaborated with Filipino firms to develop online registration for DMV, passports, visas; these arrangements were made on a cost- and revenue-share basis Market the country and the ITES industry service providers o More about marketing is mentioned below Ensure affordable infrastructure, specifically telecommunications costs o Many of those interviewed responded that the ""most significant contribution"" made by the Philippine government to the industry is to liberalize the telecommunications market. Marketing and Business Incentives Marketing     5.2 5.2.1  The most visible effort of the ITECC and the Board of Investments in promoting the industry is through the BOI's Center for International Trade Expositions and Missions (CITEM; the CITEM director in charge of the IT sector serves on ITECC's Business Development sub-committee). CITEM has already sponsored two trade expositions in Manila, ""e-Services Philippines"", which reportedly was well-attended by Filipino service providers (129 exhibitors) and other Filipino companies but not by 16  NASSCOM McKinsey 11  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study international prospects. Despite the lack of attendance by overseas customers, CITEM believed the expositions served as an effective way to gather data about the industry. The Center is planning a more targeted approach to attract international outsourcing companies to visit Manila during these expositions, such as inviting companies that are planning to visit India for that country's planned ITES trade shows. CITEM has also sponsored several trade missions to the USA, on a cost-share basis with Filipino-owned ITES companies. The agency acts as the marketing coordinator for these missions, working with the country's established export councils overseas to schedule these missions with prospective customers, and providing the appropriate marketing materials for promoting the country. In addition, CITEM facilitated the participation of ITES companies in the Offshore Outsourcing conference held in the United States in October 2001. These missions were considered an effective means to create awareness for the Philippines ITES industry. No contracts were agreed upon during the missions; however, the trip generated sufficient interest as evidenced by follow-up activities of companies inquiring about and scheduling investigative trips to the Philippines (particularly for call center vendors). Future trade missions are already scheduled for 2002, including the conference for the American Medical Transcription Association in Florida. The CITEM budget was not discussed during the interview, but it was often stated by ITECC members that there is limited funding for these marketing programs. The costs of an overseas advertising campaign, for example, are prohibitive at this time. 5.2.2 Public Relations  The Board of Investments in 2002 commissioned the Gartner Group to produce a capabilities study of the ITES industry in the Philippines, at the cost of $60,000. The early results of the study (to be published May 2002) confirm the country's strengths in call centers and BPO. The study's costs were considered an effective investment considering the influence and reach of the Gartner Group, and the resulting positive outlook for two of the Philippines' target sectors. 5.2.3 Government Incentives  There are several notable government incentives that have facilitated the growth of local companies and foreign investment in the ITES industry:   Philippine Export Processing Zones (PEZA)  IT Parks in the country are typically owned and operated by the private sector Other Incentives o Tax Holidays for 4 to 8 years o Tax and duty free importation of machinery, equipment o Simplified flow of goods o Additional deductions for training expenses o Employment of foreign nationals made easier  12  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study  6  SWOT Analysis  As the Philippines determines its competitiveness as a provider of ITES to overseas customers, as well as the segments in which it chooses to compete, elements of its position as a supplier of services can be identified: Strengths         Declining telecommunications costs Skilled, educated labor English proficiency, high level among nations Cultural affinity with USA Professional niches  medical-related fields, accounting, art Political will; partnership between public and private sectors  united message Successful ventures with overseas companies, MNC's  ""Testimonials"" Target countries17 o US and Canada o Japan o Singapore o Malaysia o Australia o Germany o UK Move up the value chain to remain competitive           Weaknesses Country image Survey of executives of foreign MNC's doing business in the Philippines cite concerns Peace and Order: Abu Sayyaf (separatist insurgencies in the south) Corruption: increasing Political winds shift unpredictably Infrastructure (power, traffic conditions) Lack of funding for overseas marketing Export-based enterprises (SME's) not enabled  Opportunities  Threats Other countries also vying for ITES o China, all segments  competing on cost o Vietnam (animation), Pakistan (software), Myanmar (BPO) o India  aggressively pursuing BPO Future supply of skilled labor  recognized need to keep workers competitive on global level Politics: Presidential elections in 2004 Foreign investment overshadows domestic  acknowledged trade-off to create jobs        7  Learnings for Bangladesh  While the Philippines appears to be gaining momentum in determining and strengthening its competitive position as a supplier of IT-Enabled Services, the country is still in the emerging stage of developing this industry sector and its export potential. The following summarizes the actions and results discussed in this report, which serve as possible action items for Bangladesh: Action: Results: Liberalize telecommunications industry Lowered costs, enabled IT industry; increased company competitiveness; increased foreign investment  17  CITEM 13  CARANA CORP O R ATI O N   Philippines Competitiveness Study Action: Results: Action: Results: Action: Results: Focus on unique competitive advantages Differentiation from other competitor countries Government provides institutional support Open market policies encourage foreign investment; marketing the country as government's role Public and private sector partnership Aligned objectives and tactics; united message to market the country  While still behind and lesser-known than India, the Philippines offers several possible best practices to Bangladesh with its efforts to formulate, articulate and implement its strategies for becoming a ""Supplier Country of Choice"".  8 8.1  Exhibits: Case Studies Medical Transcriptions: Transkripsyo  Transkripsyo, Inc. is an example of a Filipino-owned ITES company in its early stages of development.

GX265-84-7041783	"The Coming Job Boom Forget those grim unemployment numbers. Demographic forces are about to put a squeeze on the labor supply that will make it feel like 1999 all over again. By Paul Kaihla, September 2003 Issue Business 2.0 Magazine Judy Reed is a buyer in a buyer's market, and frankly, that has its advantages. The vice president for human resources at Stratus Technologies, a Maynard, Mass., maker of high- reliability servers, Reed never lacks for attention at parties and dinners in this employment- starved economy. When she does post a job, she gets four times the volume of responses she got three years ago, and some job seekers even follow up with Christmas cards. If she wanted to, she could fill every opening at a salary 15 percent below the going rate -- as, in fact, many of her competitors do. But that's one advantage Reed won't take. She recently hired an engineer with more than 10 years' experience for nearly six figures -- the same wage she paid at the height of the bubble. Reed isn't just being kind. She asserts that any other course of action is asking for trouble down the road. ""The buyer's market we're in now is temporary,"" she warns. ""Maybe it'll last another year or two."" And then? ""Companies that haven't taken care to build worker loyalty,"" she says, ""will find themselves in the same predicament as in 1999 and 2000."" At this particular moment in economic history, that is quite a statement. Two million workers have been downsized or displaced since the recession of 2001. At 6.2 percent, the national unemployment rate is the highest it's been in nine years, and the number of new jobless claims has sat above 400,000 for 20 weeks. To base hiring policy today on the prospect of a return to the tight labor market of 1999 seems not just counterintuitive -- it defies the evidence of one's own eyes. But Reed isn't alone. Executives at Cigna (CI), Intel ( INTC), SAS, Sprint (PCS), Whirlpool (WHR ), WPP (WPPGY), and Adecco (the world's largest placement firm) have told Business 2.0 that they, too, worry that the supply of labor is about to fall seriously short of demand. Former treasury secretary and current Harvard University president Larry Summers regards a skilled labor shortage as all but inevitable. Economists like former Deputy Secretary of Labor Edward Montgomery and Sigurd Nilsen, the director of education, workforce, and income security in the General Accounting Office, have issued warnings to the same effect. And in April the country's largest and most influential industrial trade group, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), added its voice to the chorus. The association released a white paper based on research by labor economist Anthony Carnevale, former chairman of President Clinton's National Commission for Employment Policy, that forecast a ""skilled worker gap"" that will start to appear the year after next and grow to 5.3 million workers by 2010 and 14 million 10 years later. (Including unskilled workers, the gaps will be 7 million in 2010 and 21 million in 2020.) ""By comparison, what employers experienced in 1999 and 2000 was a minor irritation,"" Carnevale says. ""The shortage won't just be about having to cut an extra shift. It will be about not being able to fill the first and second shift too."" This will occur, he adds, without any heroic growth rates or bubblelike economic anomalies; all it will take is a return to the economy's long-term growth rate of 3 to 3.5 percent a year. The cause of the labor squeeze is as simple as it is inexorable: During this decade and the next, the baby boom generation will retire. The largest generation in American history now constitutes about 60 percent of what both employers and economists call the prime- age workforce -- that is, workers between the ages of 25 and 54. The cohorts that follow are just too small to take the boomers' place. The shortage will be most acute among two key groups: managers, who tend to be older and closer to retirement, and skilled workers in high- demand, high- tech jobs. 1   To see the demographic time bomb in microcosm, just count the gray heads around your own office. At Sprint, for example, half of the 6,000 field and network technicians are over 50. At Cigna Systems, about a quarter of the 3,400 IT workers will pass 55 this decade. And at Cary, N.C., software maker SAS, more than a quarter of the staff will be eligible to retire by this decade's end. The company's VP for human resources, Jeff Chambers, says this group is filled with veteran designers and engineers, many of them architects of the company's most successful products. ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what's going on,"" he says. ""Existing staff are going to start getting out soon, and the feeder pool just isn't coming up. If you're responsible for the workforce, you'd better ask yourself what you are going to do."" What employers will have to do, of course, is not difficult to predict: bid up wages, raid competitors for employees, seduce older workers to stay on the job, outsource whatever work they can, and lobby the government to jack up the quota for skilled immigrants. What they will not be able to do -- at least not for much longer -- is ignore the problem. ""People think we're going to have plentiful workers forever, but that's not so,"" explains David Ellwood, a Harvard University professor who recently led an Aspen Institute study of the problem. ""If you want to hire somebody who has traditionally been the bread and butter of the labor force, you're soon going to have to hire them away from somebody else."" As the boomers retire, the workforce will stop growing ... The U.S. has always been able to count on an expanding labor force. But as the boomers are replaced by a smalle r generation, the number of workers between the prime working ages of 25 and 54 will stagnate. Prime-age workers (ages 25-54), in millions  and the average worker's education will flatline ...  During the past 20 years, the share of the workforce that had attended college grew from just over 40 percent to almost 60 percent. That figure will barely budge during the next two decades. Prime-age workers (ages 25-54) with more than a high school degree  causing a serious shortage in skilled workers. 2   The static educational level of the workforce, coupled with the retirement of the baby boomers, means that there won't be enough skilled workers to meet continuously rising demand over the next 20 years. Numbers of jobs and workers, in millions (adjusted for multiple job-holding)  Sources: David Ellwood/Aspen Institute's Domestic Strategy Group; Anthony P. Carnevale and Donna M. Desrochers, Educational Testing Service  No sentient adult could have made it through the past decade without developing a healthy distrust of forecasts like these. But the case for the worker gap differs from the usual economic entrail reading in one crucial regard: It's based on demographics , a far more certain discipline. When Carnevale's model, for instance, shows that within seven years 30 million people now in the workforce will be older than 55, that's not a guess. It is virtually a certainty. ""Any kind of demo graphic projection with respect to people who have already been born is notoriously accurate,"" agrees former Treasury Secretary Summers. What the projections reveal is a passing of the workplace torch unlike any other in U.S. history. Up to this point, each generation to enter the workforce has been larger and better- educated than its predecessor. This time, however, neither will be true. The number of workers in the prime- age category -- the years when skilled, educated workers are at their peak productiv ity -- will hardly budge during the next two decades, even assuming that there will be about 1 million legal and illegal immigrants a year. At the same time, the percentage of the prime- age labor force that has been to college will flatline at about 60 percent. In fact, enrollments in the crucial fields of engineering and computer science have actually been declining.  3   The result is an unprecedented mismatch between the workforce and the demands of a growing hightech economy. Projections by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the seven fastest- growing occupations this decade will all be in technology. Demand for applications software engineers and tech support specialists, for example, will double by 2010, according to the BLS. (See ""The 10 Fastest- Growing Occupations ."") Even the seventh- ranked category, database administrators, is projected to grow by a stunning 66 percent. These high- demand tech fields will be the first to feel the labor crunch. By 2005, Carnevale says, ""we'll start to see spot shortages all over the place."" In some fields, he predicts, employers will be reduced to filling desperate job shortages with unqualified workers. By the following decade, when the bulk of the baby boomers bid their cubicles goodbye, a broad swath of corporate America will be scraping the bottom of the barrel for white- collar workers.  Where the Jobs Are Going Americans will find the hottest job growth this decade in Southern and Western metro areas fed by expanding service industries and by a resurgence in the tech and defense sectors.  Metro area Las Vegas  Job growth, 2003- 2013 47.7% 31.9% 28.7% 25.7% 25.6% 25.3% 24.8% 24.4% 24.0% 23.7% 22.9%  Orlando West Palm Beach, FL Ft. Lauderdale, FL Riverside, CA Phoenix Jacksonville, FL Tampa, FL Raleigh- Durham, NC Sacramento, CA Austin  Every economic forecast has its critics, of course -Charlotte, NC 20.4% particularly one so at odds with the prevailing mood Atlanta 19.8% about employment. The projections assume, for San Diego 19.2% instance, that the baby boomers will leave the Washington 18.5% workforce at roughly the same age as their Dallas 17.4% predecessors, but how do we know that they won't 17.3% delay retirement to make up for recent stock market Oakland, CA losses and depressed 401(k)s ? The answer is that Miami 16.5% the trend toward early retirement is a deeply Denver 16.5% entrenched pattern establis hed during the past four Orange County, CA 16.4% decades, and neither bull nor bear markets have made a dent in it. Even the Social Security Sources: Global Insight; Bureau of Labor Administration, which would love nothing more than Statistics to make the case that the retirement age will soon rise dramatically -- the better to prove its own solvency -- has been unable to find any data to support that view. Another loud objection is that the model expects far too much growth in the battered tech sector. John Sargent, a senior policy analyst in the Commerce Department's Office of Technology Policy, says he hears that all the time. ""A lot of people say, 'Are you freaking crazy? Haven't you seen what's happened in the last year and a half?'"" But Sargent, an authority on economic measurement, defends the BLS numbers, calling them the ""closest you get to absolute objectivity."" To assume that the sector's current weakness is permanent makes no more sense than believing in 1999 that the gravy train would never end. Several studies show that where the bureau has erred, it has traditionally underestimated demand for tech. The tech sector usually leads the economy during periods of employment growth, and it's not clear what force would prevent it from doing so during the next bounce. Some skeptics argue that the culprit might be technological progress itself. They point out that a considerable amount of brainpower at software companies is now aimed at automating business data centers and, in effect, putting hordes of gainfully employed IT workers out on the street. IBM (IBM) calls the effort ""on-demand"" or ""utility"" 4   computing. Oracle (ORCL), typically, calls it nothing but boasts that it has developed software that could soon make database administrators as obsolete as typesetters. Not likely. Even if such breakthroughs ever made the leap from PowerPoint presentation to reality -- and they haven't yet -- they probably wouldn't shrink demand for tech overall. That's not how progress works. Whenever new technology eliminates less sophisticated jobs, it tends to create higher- level positions elsewhere. Cathleen Barton, U.S. education manager at Intel, points out that in 21 years of steady improvements in equipment and processes, Intel's workforce has only grown. ""There's always the argument that the more technology you put in, the fewer and less- skilled workers you will need,"" she says. ""But that's just not the case."" In 1982, for example, Intel had about 20,000 U.S. employees, and an entry- level plant operator needed only a highschool education. That worker's skills would be obsolete today, it's true. But in its current 49,000-person U.S. workforce, Intel employs far more plant technicians than it did two decades ago. The difference is that entry- level applicants now need at least a two - year degree in applied science to handle the job. If smarter software and increased automation won't derail a coming surge in demand for skilled American workers, how about competition from cheaper workers abroad? The double- digit growth in outsourcing of service jobs to low- wage countries, particularly India, has spawned more than its share of hand- wringing in the press and protectionist brimstone in state legislatures. Much of the worry seems to have crystallized around an estimate by technology research and consulting firm Forrester Research (FORR) that India and other nations will import some 3.3 million U.S. service jobs during the next 15 years.  The 10 Fastest-Growing Occupations Over the course of this decade, the biggest increase in employee demand will occur in the technology and medical fields. Here's the forecast for the top 10 job categories through 2010. Click here to close Click here to enlarge image  5   For the most part, economists say, this is mere hysteria. India, China, the Philippines , and other newly industrialized countries simply haven't enough capacity to prevent the U.S. labor squeeze, especially in IT. India's IT industry, after all, produces about $14 billion a year, a gnat on the hide of the U.S. sector's $813 billion. Likewise, the subcontinent's 150,000 tech workers represent less than 2 percent of America's domestic IT labor force, barely enough to make a ripple in the looming job shortage. And what of the 3.3 million jobs that Forrester predicts will move offshore by the end of the next decade? Most experts in the field put little faith in that number; they say there's not yet enough data to make any credible projection. (Some, in fact, dismiss Forrester's study as little more than a marketing brochure for Forrester's own offshore outsourcing consultancy.) Martin Kenney, a professor at the University of California at Davis who has just released a study on outsourcing in India, guesses that the true figure will be only half that many and that most of those will fall in to lower- skilled categories like call centers. But even if Forrester's prediction came true -- and even if each of the 3.3 million exported jobs would otherwise have been filled by a U.S. manager or skilled worker -- that still represents only a fraction of the shortage that Carnevale and other economists foresee. In other words, the long-term tragedy of offshoring isn't that it's snatching away skilled American jobs. It's that it can't possibly snatch enough of them. Elementary economics teaches that there can never be more jobs than jobholders. A gap of 5.3 million workers in 2010 doesn't mean that there will be millions of empty cubicles waiting for workers who will never show up. Instead the labor market will ""clear."" Wages in the hottest professions will rise high enough to induce workers to change careers, emigrate to Silicon Valley, or retrain themselves in the desired skills (remember ""Internet or Bust""?). Companies will coddle workers to build loyalty (remember free massages?), lure skilled retirees back from the golf course, or redeploy other workers. Eventually the demand will be met.  6   Anticipating the shortage, some companies have already put the process in motion. For example, Gail Doughtie, a vice president at Cigna Systems, has begun preparing for a shortage of database administrators by training other Cigna IT workers for the job; on big projects she looks for chances to pair veteran database administrators with junior IT workers in their 20s and 30s. For her part, Judy Reed has refused to cut not only starting salaries but also budgets for athletic teams, picnics, and parties. ""If your social life is at work, then it's harder to leave that work behind,"" she reasons. The company also offers over 70 courses a year in technology, management training, and skills like negotiating and writing. ""Loyal workers refer other loyal workers,"" she says. SAS, meanwhile, has used the current downturn to staff up, hiring more than 800 new employees. ""We've been using this downturn to buy loyalty with these people, in the hope that we can ride them through the decade,"" Chambers says. ""If you lost your job at Dotcom Inc. but got hired at SAS and prospered, you're probably not going to move when a competitor comes calling.""  For more information on the impend ing labor shortage check out these links: A new study predicts a shortage of millions of workers starting in 2005. See page 48. One of the first employers to feel the pinch of the skilledlabor shortage will be the federal government. See page 12. The Department of Defense is struggling to cope with its own retirement time bomb. The largest industrial trade association in the United States, whose companies employ about a seventh of the nation's workforce, sounds the alarm over a ""worker gap."" A Harvard economist and the Aspen Institute show how the stagnating supply of skilled workers threatens U.S. economic growth.  Like Reed, Chambers predicts that tech companies will try to offset the shortage of IT help by enticing boomers to work far beyond the standard retirement age. He's been urging senior SAS management to adopt programs to keep the more than 1,000 managers nearing retirement age from leaving. Among his suggestions is one that's almost certain to become more widespread this decade: flexible hours. ""I know I'm not going to want to work every single day when I'm 55,"" Chambers says, ""but I'll still probably want to work. We'll say, 'We'll pay you for an average of 100 hours a month, but if you want to take off June to spend time with your new grandchild, that's OK.'"" As the labor shortage grows more acute during the next decade, the returns on such tactics are likely to diminish. At the margin, there may simply be no cost- effective way to coax one more warhorse out of retirement or equip one more high school dropout for the rigors of a high- tech economy. In that case, the labor market will still clear -- but it will do so not by increasing supply, but by lowering demand. Projects will be abandoned, growth opportunities will lie fallow, and economic output will settle at a new, slower rate of growth. Between now and then, though, there promises to be one ferociously tight labor market. Hard as it may be to picture in the midst of today's employment gloom, the coming squeeze could be as big a bonanza for skilled workers as 1999 was -- and as big a headache for employers. The only difference is, you can see this one coming. Whether you prepare for it or let it catch you by surprise is up to you.  Paul Kaihla is a senior writer for Business 2.0.  7"

GX251-36-4077155	June 2002  KYRGYZSTAN PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW United States Agency for International Development Central Asia Region  ENTERPRISE & TRADE Small & Medium Agribusiness Support: USAID provides business training to assist entrepreneurs, including agribusinesses, with planning, accounting, marketing and other aspects of successful business development. USAID-supported International Fertilizer Development Center is assisting entrepreneurs who provide critical agricultural inputs and works to develop trade associations for seed and other agricultural input production, information systems, and output marketing. As part of our land reform project, USAID training promotes private land ownership, land market development, the elaboration of water law and water user rights, and post-privatization support. In the Osh oblast, located in Kyrgyzstan's part of the Ferghana Valley, rural citizens receive independent and objective legal advice that focuses on the non-violent resolution of land-related disputes. As part of USAID's Cooperation Agreement with MASHAV, Agriculture Consulting Centers deliver a wide range of technical assistance and consulting services devoted to developing agribusiness. Through participation with the government of Kyrgyzstan, USAID is supporting the Osh Agricultural Initiative to support economic reforms in the Ferghana Valley, including increasing the availability of credit, delivering technical and advisory services to agribusinesses, and developing a legal and regulatory environment that fosters greater investment and accelerates SME growth.  Implementing Partners  Pragma, MASHAV, International Fertilizer Development Center, Chemonics, Helvetas  SME Support & Business Education: USAID is supporting the Investor Roundtable, which includes the President of Kyrgyzstan and the U.S. Ambassador, to help remove existing trade barriers, stimulate foreign investment, and foster a more favorable climate for SME growth. Through Enterprise Development Centers (EDC) in Bishkek and Osh, USAID's SME Development project is delivering a comprehensive package of information, technical assistance, and business training and advisory services to entrepreneurs and business managers. Business training and business advisory services draw on donor synergies by focusing on SMEs that receive small business loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Work with accounting reform, advocacy groups, and professional associations continues to improve the SME environment by promoting greater transparency and accountability. In partnership with a Central Asian regional accounting federation, USAID is supporting a training, examination and certification program that complies with international standards of accounting and audit. A new Regional Trade Promotion activity is facilitating regional trade through an internet-based regional trade network. USAID continues to deliver a wide range of volunteer technical assistance, including business consulting and business association development that strengthens business skills and practices and develops greater advocacy for reform. Finally, USAID's Resource Network for Economics and Business Education (EdNet) is offering college students greater access to information and opportunities to succeed in the free market by training professors in economics and business education, as well as making available teaching materials, and providing research opportunities and scholarships.  KIMEP, Pragma, Carana, MBA-EC, MASHAV  Financial Markets: USAID is helping develop a more responsive financial sector, with stronger financial institutions and greater availability of credit. Working with the National Bank, USAID is focusing on improving the regulation of the banking sector and implementing supervisory techniques that meet international standards. Areas of particular importance are off-site surveillance, problem bank identification and resolution. In addition, USAID is providing increased opportunities for agrobusinesses to access credit. The USAID-supported Small Enterprise Assistance fund is providing equity, term-debt, and lease financing that gives entrepreneurs access to investment capital to expand and run their businesses. Through support of FINCA and the Bai Tushum Financial Foundation, USAID is also providing micro-entrepreneurs with microfinancing and technical and advisory services that helps expand their businesses and create jobs. Commercial Law & Trade: USAID is working at both the local and national level to help reduce legal and regulatory constraints to business by improving policy-making and increasing transparency in the regulatory process. USAID is also assisting the government in developing a system of commercial and land legislation that supports private enterprise and land market development. Training aims to strengthen professionals', such as judges, attorneys and tax inspectors, capacity to interpret and apply commercial legislation. USAID also provides training to professionals and farmers to increase awareness and implementation of private land ownership rights and obligations. Critical post-World Trade Organization accession support is aimed at ensuring that WTO obligations and requirements are fulfilled, while assistance to the State Customs Committee is helping modernize customs procedures to meet international standards.  KPMG/Barents Group, FINCA, ACDI/VOCA  Chemonics, ARD/Checchi, Pragma, Helvetas, MBA-EC   Tax & Budget Systems: USAID, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Office of the President, Parliament and the Tax Inspectorate, is working to improve tax policy and administration, budget development and intergovernmental finance. USAID is helping bring about a stable, equitable fiscal sector by working with the government to develop sound, simple tax policy and accurate policy analysis methods. To capitalize on the will for decentralization, USAID is increasingly concentrating its efforts at the oblast and city administration levels to improve their budget and finance processes. This includes helping Osh and Bishkek convert their budget development process to a program based process.  KPMG/Barents Group  DEMOCRATIC CULTURE & INSTITUTIONS Civic Organizations: USAID supports the growth of Kyrgyz NGOs and civic organizations through the establishment of Civil Society Support Centers (CSSCs), grant programs, promotion of NGO advocacy programs and organizational development training. This support reinforces the development of sound programming practices to increase the professionalism, financial sustainability and impact that NGOs have in their communities. In particular, USAID supports the development of regional NGOs serving outside of the major cities of Osh and Bishkek. Grassroots advocacy programs lead to constructive activities and greater citizen participation in local communities. USAID also supports the empowerment of NGOs in targeted areas, such as the legal and environmental sectors. Media & Information: USAID supports independent television and radio stations through seminars, internships, residencies, limited equipment donations and training manuals. Support focuses on providing stations with training in television management, advertising sales, television computer graphics, radio management and radio journalism. USAID/CAR supports the development of the Association of Journalists in Kyrgyzstan. USAID promotes the development of civic education programs through seminars, youth summer camps, law libraries/information centers and civic initiative planning at the local level. USAID is developing a civic education textbook and course for secondary schools. Political Process: USAID provides technical assistance to reform-minded parliamentarians to strengthen the institution and their role as legislators. Assistance helps deputies increase the transparency and openness of Parliament to citizens and NGOs. USAID continues to provide limited assistance to political parties. USAID also promotes the development of an independent judiciary through professional legal associations.  Implementing Partners  ABA/CEELI, Counterpart Consortium, NDI, ISAR  ABA/CEELI, IFES, Internews, IOM  ABA/CEELI, ICNL, NDI Urban Institute, ICMA  Local Government: USAID promotes decentralization and good governance in self-government cities, as well as through policy dialogue with the central government and Parliament. USAID trains locally elected council members and local officials nationwide in promoting public participation, budgetary and financial management, and community property management issues. Condominium associations receive accounting and management training. USAID advises national policy makers and legislators on ways legislation can strengthen local governments' authority and effectiveness and contributes to local government law drafting. As part of the Resource Cities program, USAID organizes exchanges of local government representatives between Naryn and Great Falls, Montana, to improve the quality of Naryn's local administration and to strengthen democracy at the local level.  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE Quality Primary Health Care: In close collaboration with the World Bank, USAID is helping the Ministry of Health implement a comprehensive, cost-effective health care system that currently provides services to more than 40% of the population. Working in six of seven oblasts, USAID works to improve families' access to quality primary health care (PHC) and increase consumer options and satisfaction with PHC. The new family doctor system brings quality health care close to people and offers real incentives for doctors to provide quality, client-centered care. PHC practices now provide maternal and child healthcare services and address infectious diseases. To better finance and promote competition, USAID is designing and implementing incentive-based provider payment methods. New management and health information systems at the oblast and national level developed by USAID are improving financial and management decision-making. USAID is also strengthening health sector NGO capacity through needsbased organizational development assistance, by helping to design new services that NGO members can purchase and by teaching advocacy skills. Health Partnerships: USAID supports a partnership among the University of Nevada School of Medicine (UNSM), the University of South Florida Health Sciences Center and the Kyrgyz State Medical Academy (KSMA). This partnership is enhancing the quality of education in family medicine, nursing and health care administration by creating model curricula and faculty development programs that support the goals of the Kyrgyz Republics's Manas health care reform program.  Implementing Partners  Abt Associates/ Zdrav Plus, Counterpart Consortium  AIHA   Infectious Disease Control: USAID provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Health to implement the WHOrecommended Directly Observed Therapy Short-course (DOTS) strategy nationwide. The program strengthens and standardizes DOTS clinical and laboratory training and monitors program implementation in close collaboration with WHO. To assure quality training and monitoring of the DOTS program, USAID hired a TB educator and TB program manager to reside in Bishkek. USAID continues to support activities to strengthen the Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory and the viral hepatitis sentinel surveillance system in Bishkek, Jalal-Abad and Naryn. A fully functioning Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) diagnostic system has been installed and personnel trained for PCR procedures, enabling the laboratory to confirm ethiological diagnosis of Viral Hepatitis. USAID, in close collaboration with WHO, initiated quarterly Infectious Disease Roundtables to better coordinate the Government of Kyrgyzstan and donors' efforts. HIV/AIDS Control & Prevention: USAID is initiating an extensive program of activities to control and prevent the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central Asia. An important part of USAID's strategy includes a new collaborative effort with Soros Foundation  Kazakhstan to extend programs for those groups most vulnerable to the epidemic: injection drug users, commercial sex workers and prisoners. Research and training in HIV/AIDS surveillance has been initiated. USAID has started activities on HIV/AIDS prevention, which included a study tour for government officials to a model Harm Reduction site in Vilnius, Lithuania; Central Asian Condom Social Marketing Assessment and Workshop; and the Central Asian Initiative Conference on the Prevention of HIV/AIDS/STIs. A document highlighting USAID's strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention in Central Asia has been published. Condom social marketing programs will be initiated in the epicenters of the epidemic: Karaganda city, Kazakhstan, Osh city, Kyrgyzstan, and in Uzbekistan's portion of the Ferghana Valley.  CDC, Project HOPE, RPM  Soros Foundation, PSI, CDC  ENERGY & WATER MANAGEMENT Natural Resource Management: To improve resource efficiency and mitigate the potential for conflict over shared resources, USAID is initiating transboundary activities that will include training, increased policy dialogue, and installation of sustainable energy and water management models. Transboundary water and related energy cooperation activities are centered in Kyrgyzstan, the source of regional water for downstream countries. The regional effort on transboundary and related cooperation promotes best management practices, regional water and energy data storing, and the development of international agreements that meet international standards in order to reduce tensions over shared water resources. USAID is helping improve access to information, knowledge and skills so that energy and water specialists can more effectively manage natural resources, particularly transboundary and local water resources. Strengthened data collection and communication systems are promoting national and regional information sharing necessary to help water managers make more informed decisions on annual forecasting of snowmelt, planning, allocating, and modeling critical water systems. USAID is working closely with the World Bank and other international donors and is providing equipment installation, associated software models and training.  Implementing Partners  PA Consulting, Winrock International, Development Alternatives Inc.  Public Commitment: USAID is building public interest and commitment for reform in the management of water resources and to promote best environmental and natural resources management practices. Public awareness activities are coupled with practical assistance efforts, such as models that demonstrate the viability of management concepts and new technologies, as well as the practicality of proposed policy and regulatory framework reforms. USAID is exploring the use of low-cost means that water user groups can employ on-farm to determine water needs for a given crop. The technique will help empower water user associations as decision-making organizations in water management. In energy, the development of a pilot project of a locally owned small hydroelectricity plant will demonstrate energy privatization. For example, local water user groups, using simple technology, will be able to more accurately assess their on-farm water needs and communicate this information to those who allocate irrigation water. This information will then be integrated into the planning for water allocations on a larger level.  PA Consulting  SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES The Conflict Mitigation Initiative, which includes the Community Action Investment Program (CAIP), promotes public dialogue, improves management of transboundary water resources and public health facilities, and increases education and other opportunities for youth. Focusing on southern Kyrgyzstan and the Ferghana Valley, this initiative will introduce community participatory processes to help identify sources of conflict, prioritize investments in social infrastructure improvements, create several thousand new short-term and sustainable jobs (the majority of which will be for youth), and improve social services through new and repaired infrastructure.  Implementing Partners  Mercy Corps, ACDI/VOCA  Youth & Education: USAID-funded civics education textbook and accompanying teacher training and manuals are in use in secondary schools in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; USAID-supported democracy summer camps, student local government days, and student action committees round out the extracurricular portion of this program. A merit testing program for university admittance is underway in Kyrgyzstan. Business education and training is a key component of USAID's enterprise objective across the region (see section on Business Support & Education above). USAID's Peaceful Communities Initiative (PCI) supports the Ferghana Valley Youth Basketball League. There are four teams of 15-16 year-olds who represent an ethnic mix that includes Uzbeks, Tatars, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Turks and Russians. An Osh condominium association is working with PCI, Urban Institute and a local NGO to construct sport and play areas for a separate city-wide, summer basketball league for boys and girls. Game Days are being implemented in cross-border areas through the Sports and Health Education Project, which aims to use sports as a vehicle to bring neighbors together, promote healthy life styles and advocate against drug use. USAID will address on a more comprehensive basis the deterioration of education in Central Asia and is modifying its crosscutting objective into a new special objective to improve basic education, particularly in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Kyrgyzstan, the program will support the progressive  IFES, Soros Foundation OSI, Mercy Corps, Urban Institute, Carana, Abt Associates   Minister of Education's new education initiative through pilot schools.  Eurasia Foundation makes small grants to support the growth of market and democratic institutions. Grants are focused in three program areas: Civil Society, Public Administration and Private Enterprise Development. Eurasia Foundation makes small grants on an ongoing basis, oriented to support the transition from centrally-planned to market economies. Eurasia operates mostly on an open-door basis, ie local organizations are encouraged to submit proposals at any time for funding. The average grant size is approximately $16,000. Enterprise and Finance has piloted several innovative programs that were later made part of larger donor programs, including the Ferghana Valley Initiative, student legal clinics and business education. Participant Training & Exchanges: Training and exchanges remain a critical element for accomplishing USAID/CAR's overall strategic goals, and participants are carefully selected to support and complement USAID's broader portfolio and objectives. The training program is highly flexible and includes workshops, on-the-job training, observation, study tours and conferences and generates new ideas from participants on improving practices in their own countries. USAID provides short-term training courses in the United States, in-country and in third countries for mid-to-senior level leaders and professionals in areas directly relevant to the transition to democracy and a free-market economy. Training, exchanges and partnerships are fundamental to overall success since participants are carefully selected to support and complement USAID's broader portfolio and objectives. Annually, USAID trains over 9,000 Kyrgyzstanis through various activities. Of this total USAID trained over 1,2000 decision-makers, professionals and active citizens, nearly two-thirds of whom were women. In 2002, a new training and exchanges program called Strategic Technical Assistance for Results through Training (START) began.

GX038-39-12002899	View Header     THE WHITE HOUSE                         Office of the Press Secretary                            (New Delhi, India) ________________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                     March 21, 2000                         TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT                      TO THE MAJORITY AND DEMOCRATIC                          LEADERS OF THE SENATE                                      New Delhi                                 March 21, 2000     Dear Mr. Leader:    I am pleased that the Senate is moving forward with consideration of H.R.  5, a bill that would eliminate the retirement earnings test above the normal retirement age.  On March 1, 2000, with strong Administration support, the House passed H.R. 5 by a vote of 422-0.  I now urge the Senate to follow suit and quickly pass H.R. 5.  This will ensure enactment of a clean, straightforward bill to eliminate the retire-ment earnings test above the normal retirement age, which I will promptly sign into law.    I called for the elimination of the earnings test for seniors in my State of the Union address in 1999.  I believe that the test is confusing and outdated.  As the baby boomers begin to retire, it is more important than ever that older Americans who are willing and able to work should not have their Social Security benefits deferred when they do.    Our work together on eliminating the retirement earnings test can help establish bipartisan momentum toward Social Security reform.  We should build on this foundation to pass legislation that would extend the solvency of Social Security to about 2050 while taking signifi-cant actions to reduce poverty among elderly women.  Last year, I transmitted legislation to Congress that would have used the interest savings earned by paying down the debt to make Social Security stronger.  If we agree to this simple step, we can extend the life of Social Security to the middle of the next century while also modernizing Social Security to reduce poverty among elderly women.    These simple measures would be a substantial down payment on meeting the long-term Social Security challenge.  I hope we can continue to work together on this issue.                                       Sincerely,     WILLIAM J. CLINTON                                      # # #
GX243-29-13604158	"Kyrgyzstan The Development Challenge: Kyrgyzstan has been the most open, progressive, and cooperative of the Central Asian republics even with a tumultous year in 2002. Kyrgyzstan leads the region in health care reform and in actively addressing new health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, in an open and direct manner. However, government supplied social services, critical to maintaining public support for reform, are still inadequate. Widespread poverty, pervasive corruption, and limited prospects for economic growth will continue to negatively affect all social programs and development. The implementation of a transparent national test for all students seeking a government university scholarship is a bright spot in education reform and the reduction of corrupt practices. Civil society in Kyrgyzstan is more developed than in other Central Asian countries, although the Freedom House rating is likely to drop to ""not free"" in 2002 from the 2001 rating of ""partly free,"" and the civil liberties rating is likely to decline from 5 to 6 (with 7 representing the lowest degree of freedom). Nevertheless, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civic organizations, and media are increasingly able to influence government policy and legislation. Parliament is increasingly active and responsive and provides a check on government control. Positive signs of macro-economic stabilization continue with tax collections increasing by 12.8% for the period JanuaryAugust 2002. Inflation dropped from 8% in 2001 to 2% for the period January-September 2002. The latest GOK figures indicate a decline in poverty from 52% to 47.6% in 2001. However, industrial output fell by 13% and GDP declined by 2.6% in 2002 due to an accident in July 2002 at the country's flagship gold venture which affected gold production and exports. Limited access to trade routes, in part brought about by vested interests that threw roadblocks in front of efforts to reduce trade barriers, a heavy burden of external debt ($1.5 billion), a weak bank sector, as well as corrupt courts overturning two bank closures, all threaten economic and political reform and limit growth. Poverty and limited opportunities particularly jeopardize stability in the south where isolation, difficult borders, lack of investment, and ethnic differences are problems. Kyrgyzstan's location at the headwaters of major river systems in Central Asia enable it to affect irrigation, electricity generation, and the environment in the downstream countries of Central Asia. All of these challenges, along with an essentially closed border with Uzbekistan, are potential sources of conflict that could threaten regional stability and U.S. economic and political interests in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan has remained a stalwart friend of the United States and a firm ally in the war on terrorism. Kyrgyzstan's support in the form of the vital coalition airbase in Manas and associated over-flight rights were essential to allied successes in Afghanistan, and Kyrgyzstan continues to be a strong strategic partner to the U.S. and others. Kyrgyzstan's reform agenda directly advances U.S. national interests in ensuring stability by promoting economic and democratic reform. The USAID Program: The U.S. assistance program in Kyrgyzstan aims to strengthen democratic culture, support private sector economic development, promote rational and effective management of water, and increase the availablity of higher quality primary health care. These mutually reinforcing objectives help establish the environment necessary for democracy and markets to flourish, which will thereby promote internal stability and greater prosperity. USAID programs build on Kyrgyzstan's cooperativeness, relatively open civil society, and economic and health reforms to meet the challenges of continuing oligarchy, corruption, debt burden, lack of trade, broad poverty, and weak governance. The Program Data Sheets cover five strategic objectives and two special objectives for which USAID is requesting funds. The five objectives promote reforms that foster the growth of small and medium enterprises, promote civil society and expand access to information, improve primary health care and prevent infectious disease, encourage better use of the region's water and energy resources, and address other cross cutting issues within the region. Two proposed special objectives, made possible through supplemental funding, will support reforms in basic education and prevent conflict. Given the focus on Central Asia since the war on terrorism, the new special objective for conflict prevention will expand and adjust USAID's on-going conflict prevention efforts to better respond to broader U.S. objectives in the region. FY 2003 funds will be used to implement the program as currently planned and previously described in the FY 2002 Congressional Budget Justification, including cross-cutting objectives in youth, gender, anti-corruption, and rule of law. USAID will continue to emphasize conflict prevention   through media, education, agro-enterprise growth and community development, especially in the southern portion of the country. In FY 2003, USAID's local government activities will be combined into the broader democracy objective to streamline management and our activities to increase the soundness of fiscal and budget policies will be integrated into our strategic objective on improving the environment for small and medium enterprises. With additional resources from FY 2002 supplemental appropriations, new initiatives in basic education, malaria control, local government, fiscal and banking reform, and agribusiness will begin in FY 2003. Specific activities to be funded by FY 2003 and FY 2004 appropriations are described in the Program Data Sheets that follow. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS: Supplemental funding enabled expansion by nearly 60% of USAID activities in Kyrgyzstan. USAID expanded programs that support broad-based economic and democratic development, with an overall objective of reducing the potential for conflict and extremism in the region. Our small and medium enterprise program (SME) placed heavier emphasis on developing a sound environment for micro-financial institutions and on providing greater access to credit. Increased support for the Osh Agri-business Initiative will increase competitiveness of firms in the volatile Ferghana Valley by helping products enter regional and international markets. USAID supports citizen participation by bolstering parliamentary and civic advocacy programs, in addition to increased support for a legal reform program. USAID created the Community Action Investment Project, the centerpiece of the USG's conflict prevention efforts in Central Asia, to reduce the threat of extremism and ethnic- or resource-based conflicts. USAID also began a basic education program and supported an endowment for the American University of Central Asia, funded jointly with the Soros Foundation. Supplemental funds will fund a desperately needed malaria control program and extend health reform, especially in the south, through direct support of two national NGOs. Other Program Elements: Partnerships, training and exchanges remain an important component of U.S. assistance. USAID's participant training project trained over 2,000 Kyrgyzstani citizens in SME development, fiscal and tax reform, higher education, NGO development and advocacy and management and technical training for health work in FY 2002. USAID supports a number of U.S.-Kyrgyzstani institutional partnerships that seek to build lasting relationships. The Farmer-to-Farmer Program is active in Kyrgyzstan. The Eurasia Foundation has an active small grants program, which complements the USAID programs in education, small business, local government, and civil society. The Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State also manage programs complementary to USAID field activities in various sectors. Other Donors: Kyrgyzstan's largest donors are the Asian Development Bank (roads, agriculture, education, health, and corporate governance) and the World Bank (irrigation, agriculture, health, and micro-credit). Other bilateral donors besides the United States include the British (DFID), the Swiss and German governments and the European Union (TACIS). DFID and TACIS have increased their programs in response to the events of September 11. TACIS has a major food security program that provides budget support. DFID is supporting land reform, water and sanitation, health, and irrigation. Land reform is also being promoted by the United States, Swiss, and World Bank. The United States, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank are cooperating on banking reform. Nearly all the major donors are involved in small/medium enterprise development. The World Health Organization and the U.S., Swiss, German, British, and Japanese governments jointly support health activities. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Soros, and the EU co-fund civil society support centers, along with USAID. The Swiss and German governments are working in the area of natural resources management.   Kyrgyzstan PROGRAM SUMMARY (in thousands of dollars) Accounts FREEDOM Support Act Emergency Response Fund - FSA/NIS Supplemental - FSA/NIS Total Program Funds FY 2001 Actual 32,594 0 0 32,594 FY 2002 Actual 35,489 3,500 33,000 71,989 FY 2003 Prior Request 36,000 0 0 36,000 FY 2004 Request 40,000 0 0 40,000  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE SUMMARY 116-0120 Tax and Budget Policy FSA 116-0131 Small and Medium Enterprises FSA 116-0161 Energy and Water FSA 116-0211 Democratic Culture and Institutions FSA 116-0230 More Effective and Accountable Local Governance FSA 116-0240 Conflict Prevention FSA 116-0320 Health and Population FSA 116-0340 Strengthened Basic Education Sector FSA 116-0420 Cross-Cutting Programs FSA TRANSFER FSA 8,476 29,886 8,400 7,960 2,300 7,700 1,000 3,350 1,700 0 2,800 0 5,268 850 15,450 1,700 7,025 0 0 4,500 0 12,578 0 11,735 1,700 5,600 0 0 5,458 0 3,107 0 13,640 2,010 6,621 0 668 6,217 492 2,392  SO 116-0131 includes $5,500 of FY 2002 Supplemental - FSA/NIS.

By making government more responsive to public demands while reducing the excess burden of taxation, this SO benefits entrepreneurs, investors, as well as the wider tax-paying public and citizenry. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Fiscal and tax reform ($0 FSA). USAID intends to close out SO 1.2 in FY 2003, and will integrate fiscal/tax reform activities into the increased implementation of laws and regulations program under SO 1.3. FY 2004 Program: Fiscal and tax reform ($0 FSA). None Performance and Results: USAID's fiscal reform program continued to make important contributions to overall economic stability and growth and investment climate improvement. By helping to increase government revenues and the efficiency of public expenditures and by making government more responsive to public demands, USAID's work in fiscal reform helped expand economic opportunities and reduce the potential for conflict. Our strong relationship with Parliament was a major factor in our ability to provide support in key areas such as tax policy and fiscal analysis. That relationship also opened up access for other USAID projects to gain valuable information that helped make more informed decisions. Collaboration with the National Democratic Institute and the United Nations Development Program was crucial in strengthening the capacity of media and NGOs to engage in meaningful participation in the budget process. Improvements in the Tax Code and Tax Administration met our expectations. In January, a new simplified tax regime for small and medium enterprises took effect in Kyrgyzstan. Designed in large part by the USAID advisors, this new system replaces four complex taxes - income, sales, road, and emergency with an optional simple calculation based on gross receipts for small businesses, reducing both record keeping requirements and the taxpayer-tax official contacts that often result in corruption. President Akayev approved an overhaul of the fragmented, duplicative tax and customs administrations that facilitate corruption and widespread tax evasion. To address these issues, our advisors were called upon to work closely with the government to develop a revenue administration restructuring plan, which was finalized at a workshop organized and staffed by our fiscal reform team. The finalized plan is a significant step in ensuring greater transparency and accountability within that function, which has the support of the Prime Minister.   For the second year in a row, the republican budget submission reflects 100% compliance with program budgeting by all agencies, demonstrating both the increased capacity and understanding of the methodology developed among agency staff by our fiscal advisors, as well as the value placed on this information by the Ministry of Finance and Parliament. Like last year, these documents will be placed on the Internet, and parliamentary leaders have committed to hold budget hearings using this information. In addition, success with program budgeting has led directly to extensions such as resource agreements that increase efficiency of allocations. Results of our index measuring improvements in Budget Development and Execution outperformed predicted success. In May, our advisors conducted the first-ever regional budget training, covering the entire country. These sessions were designed to prepare sub-national officials for meeting enhanced responsibilities associated with fiscal decentralization and have directly led to the creation of local budget resource centers and ongoing train-the-trainer programs that will reach out to all 500+ local governments in Kyrgyzstan. Building local budget capacity will greatly further the nation's progress toward a marketbased democracy. Joint efforts of USAID's fiscal and democracy programs continued to bring more transparency to the budget approval process, improving both the quality of budget analysis by parliamentarians and the quality of the budget itself. Thanks in large part to our fiscal reform advisors, the Kyrgyz Parliament assumed an increased role in fiscal policy making during 2002. The parliament enacted a comprehensive annual budget resolution, conducted the first hearing on intergovernmental finance outside of Bishkek, held the first open meetings in the history of the People's Assembly on fiscal issues, and proposed new budget and tax laws and a bold plan for the restructuring of revenue agencies. As a consequence, leadership in fiscal policy has shifted from the executive to the legislative branch in many areas, and discussion of constitutional reform now underway shows the effect of this increase in parliament's role. This SO is scheduled for phase-out this year. USAID's fiscal reform work, formerly implemented under the fiscal reform program, will now be integrated into the improved business environment program, and will strengthen the government's fiscal analysis capacity and local government's fiscal management. USAID will be collaborating with the World Bank on vital issues such as tax administration and computer modernization. Through our tax program, we will make efforts to cooperate closely with the ADB, which is committing $27 million for customs reorganization.   Data Sheet USAID Mission:   Program Title:  Pillar:   Strategic Objective:   Status:   Proposed FY 2003 Obligation:  Prior Year Unobligated:  Proposed FY 2004 Obligation:  Year of Initial Obligation:  Estimated Completion Date:   Kyrgyzstan  Small and Medium Enterprises   Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade  116-0131  Continuing  $11,735,000 FSA  $1,625,000 FSA  $13,640,000 FSA  2000  2005   Summary: USAID's program to improve the environment for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) includes three main components: training in business skills, specialized business advisory services, and business information; providing more access to capital by enhancing lender knowledge, strengthening financial institutions, and creating alternative sources of financing; and advocacy for and training in more transparent, systematic implementation of laws and regulations. A weak government, a banking sector riddled with corruption and excessive political interference, and significant regulatory and administrative barriers continued to discourage investment. Prior year unobligated funds include $300,000 of FY 2002 Supplemental - FSA/NIS. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Business skills and information ($4,740,000 FSA). Business training will target entrepreneurs and business managers. Work in accounting reform, business advisory services, advocacy group development, and professional associations will continue. Supplemental funds will contribute to the expansion of the Regional Trade Promotion (RTP) Activity and, through the EdNet activity, will support additional training, teaching materials, research opportunities, and scholarships. USAID's principal partners include Pragma Corp. (prime), Carana Corp. (prime), and Junior Achievement International (prime). Access to capital ($1,265,000 FSA). With supplemental funds, a new program will start to strengthen onsite and off-site supervision and develop a computerized early warning system to identify problem banks, as well provide technical assistance and some financial support to strengthen the micro-finance sector. Supplemental funds will support technical assistance to European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) partner banks to help facilitate lending, while business training will leverage that assistance by focusing on EBRD client SMEs. USAID will provide technical assistance and some financial support to offer entrepreneurs greater access to alternative sources of capital, including equity, debt, and leasing. USAID's principal partners include BearingPoint (prime), Small Enterprise Assistance Fund (prime), EBRD (prime), and ACDI/VOCA/FINCA (prime). Implementation of laws and regulations ($5,730,000 FSA). With supplemental funds, USAID will increase assistance to streamline the legal and regulatory environment and develop a system of commercial and land legislation to support private enterprise and land market development. Supplemental funds will contribute to additional support in commercial law and private land ownership rights and obligations. Technical assistance will help bring the country's standards and certification regime into compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements. Customs advisors will help reform and modernize the custom regime to meet international standards. Advisors will provide post-WTO accession support and provide guidance on a timeframe for Kyrgyzstan's graduation from WTO assistance. Supplemental funds will support technical assistance to increase the transparency and efficiency of public expenditures by developing local government capacity in budget development and revenue forecasting and collection.   USAID's principal partners include: Pragma Corp. (prime), Bearing Point (prime), Chemonics (prime), ARD/Checchi (prime), and Helvetas (prime). FY 2004 Program: Business skills and information ($5,183,200 FSA). Training, teaching materials, research opportunities, and scholarships will be made available to Kyrgyz universities, businesses, regulators, and entrepreneurs. Business training will target entrepreneurs and business managers. Work in accounting reform, business advisory services, advocacy group development, and professional associations will continue. USAID will continue support its RTP Activity. Access to capital ($2,318,800 FSA). Technical assistance and training will support on-site and off-site supervision, and problem bank identification and resolution of problem banks. Some financial support will be provided to the Small Enterprise Assistance Fund to facilitate financing for SMEs. USAID will continue to help developing stronger micro-finance institutions by building capacity, providing lending capital, and helping improve the legal and regulatory environment for microfinance. USAID will support further technical assistance to EBRD partner banks that facilitates greater lending to SMEs. Implementation of laws and regulations ($6,138,000 FSA). Technical assistance and training will continue to foster development of a legal and regulatory environment that supports private enterprise growth and land market development. Experts will concentrate efforts on customs reform and modernization, land reform, and post-WTO accession assistance. Legal assistance to rural citizens will support resolution of legal disputes and promotion of legal rights and obligations. USAID will continue to identify and help remove administrative barriers to trade and will provide assistance to the Ministry of Industry and Trade in modernizing the country's standards and certification regime and bringing it into compliance with WTO requirements. If funds permit, and based on further assessments, technical assistance will support public sector accounting. Technical assistance will continue to develop local government capacity in budget development and revenue forecasting and collection. Performance and Results: Supplemental funding enabled USAID to expand business development opportunities. USAID partners helped develop a new law on microfinance organizations that defines their status, and creates the legal and organizational prerequisites for microfinance activities. Funds supported greater access to credit through an EBRD lending program and the Small Enterprise Assistance Fund's equity and debt investments. Funds increased support for the Osh Agri-business Initiative, to foster greater competitiveness and increased regional and international trade in the Ferghana Valley. USAID business advisors worked with more than 70 agricultural enterprises in Osh Oblast, introducing business concepts such as quality and linking firms with larger markets. USAID trained over 3,000 businesspeople in marketing, accounting, and other business fields, while land rights training reached over 13,800 farmers. USAID supported a national merit-based testing program for high-school graduates, reducing corruption in the award of scholarships. The USAID-supported, Bai Tushum Financial Foundation disbursed 1,130 new micro-loans exceeding $1.96 million, and is credited with the maintenance or creation of 7,000 jobs. Through the Land Reform Project's urban sales program, six pilot cities sold 55 land parcels, earning nearly $100,000 in revenue that is being used for social services and reconstruction of the municipal governments. By the end of this objective, it is expected that entrepreneurial opportunities will have expanded, providing a basis for broad-based economic growth and reduction of poverty in Kyrgyzstan. By program's end, reforms to the regulatory and legal environment will help foster the development of small and medium enterprises, which are critical to employment and revenue generation. In addition, entrepreneurs will have access to credit and the modern business skills and knowledge to start up and run successful businesses.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0131 Small and Medium Enterprises  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002* Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds** Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

Because Kyrgyzstan has access to few oil and natural gas resources, the country requires significant amounts of water to generate electrical power for heating during the winter. Water resources and energy considerations are closely related in Kyrgyzstan due to the barter agreement where Kyrgyzstan supplies Uzbekistan with water in summer for irrigation in return for gas and electricity in winter. Management of the country's water is key to its own energy development needs and to cooperation with its regional neighbors. USAID advances in this program during the last year have exceeded expectations. Major components of the USAID program are: 1) training for water, energy, and meteorological officials and managers; 2) installation of sustainable, affordable energy efficiency and on-farm water management models that demonstrate new, more efficient technology and management techniques; 3) improving the policy and regulatory framework, especially in the hydropower and transboundary water sectors; and 4) developing public commitment to improve the process of energy efficiency and privatization. A limited amount of supplemental funding will support pilot projects to demonstrate technologies and procedures for distribution and transmission companies to reduce electrical losses. Improving resource management in Central Asia is a task that involves intensive training. USAID will continue to complement and reinforce training through models that demonstrate the viability of new management concepts and technologies. Prior year unobligated funds include $200,000 of FY 2002 Supplemental - FSA/NIS. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Water ($850,000 FSA). USAID's water sector management initiatives will continue on a dual course: a) upgrading weather and water resources data collection and monitoring systems; and, b) training in how to use this data and apply it in transboundary and national water management decisions. These efforts will improve the country's ability to participate effectively in a regional program of improved river flow management for irrigation. USAID will also continue its on-farm water management activities with the design, procurement, manufacture, and installation of water control and measuring structures in Kyrgyzstan. Irrigation water measuring structures designed and constructed for the Sahi-darya Water User Association in Osh Oblast will continue to support water user associations in Kyrgyzstan. These activities will help farmers more effectively manage irrigations flows and increase production. The principal implementing partner for this project is PA Consulting (prime). Energy ($850,000 FSA). Trans-boundary regional water management activities will include training in the use and maintenance of new technologies and procedures to reduce energy use in Kyrgyzstan to bring down the demand for winter water. Pilot heating projects will demonstrate the efficacy of simple, inexpensive technologies in promoting energy conservation and cost savings. Ongoing energy-related activities will continue, including work to extend the benefits of heat loss reduction techniques to additional areas; assist Kyrgyz officials in developing a comprehensive National Energy Strategy with public participation; and to complete the pilot rural level hydro-power plant. Projects will raise public   awareness and participation and be conducted with the full participation of the State Energy Agency. PA Consulting is the chief implementer of the project for water and energy activities. FY 2004 Program: Water ($1,010,000 FSA). Water resource activities will strengthen pilot programs begun in 2003 to develop farm-level irrigation management. We will work closely with other donors to expand locallyadapted irrigation devices that improve river flow management. USAID will also continue to strengthen the government's capacity to forecast river flows to improve irrigation. Energy ($1,000,000 FSA). USAID will continue to work with the State Energy Agency, the independent regulator of the electric sector of Kyrgyzstan, to establish a transparent, equitable tariff structure for energy services, encourage independent local utilities, and hold regular public hearings. In addition, new demonstration projects in heating efficiency will be initiated in schools, a hospital, and other public buildings. Additional specialized training will continue, particularly in connection with demonstration and field activities. Such training will complement assistance in support of minimizing losses in the electric power system, which currently are estimated at 42%. Due to the important role Kyrgyzstan plays as a source for regional water for downstream countries, the USAID Transboundary Water Project is centered in Kyrgyzstan, and FY 2004 activities will continue to emphasize training and demonstrations to more efficiently manage power generation, thus contributing to increased downstream flows for other regional needs. Performance and Results: The principal USAID energy activity in Kyrgyzstan is the implementation of a small community hydropower demonstration model, which began during 2002. This system will provide a more reliable source of electrical power to the community than at present, and will be a self-sustainable system operated at the local level. Its completion will mark the first time that a community will have local control over its energy needs. One of the most notable successes of the activity is its widespread community support, including significant local cash contributions as matching funds support. Corollary successes in job creation (a fruit processing plant, a sewing business, and an irrigation pump all rely on the power generated through this system) and in conflict prevention (in an ethnic Uzbek village) are also notable. A successful heat-loss reduction demonstration model was completed in two public schools in the community of Kara-Balta. The activity, which affects approximately 300 students, successfully demonstrated to community residents and leaders the advantages of automatically adjusting the heating requirements of its school buildings, not only providing cost savings but also creating a more comfortable learning environment for students. In response to this effort, the Kara-Balta city administration has committed to replicating the project; USAID will work with them in FY 2003 to design a program. To better manage on-farm irrigation flows, USAID made substantial progress with the design, procurement, manufacture, and installation of 15 water control and measuring structures in the Sahi-darya Water User Association in Osh Oblast. Designed and manufactured locally to meet Kyrgyz needs, these models were later adopted for use in a World Bank project supporting the development of water user associations in Kyrgyzstan. Such water flow measuring devices, designed and manufactured at the local level in Kyrgyzstan, are new to the irrigation sector, and are expected to increase agricultural yields for about 1,000 farmers. USAID's training activities couple classroom learning with practical application of policies and technologies in the field. A recent example of this is seen in the public's participation in the development of a comprehensive National Energy Strategy. Officials at the local and national levels, as well as community representatives, were trained in conducting, participating in, and influencing public meetings that lead to policy decisions. By the completion date of this objective, water managers will have the necessary tools and training to better collect, communicate, and process water data resulting in improved allocations and overall management of the resource. Also, water and energy agreements will be based more on objective data and standards, thereby mitigating the potential for conflict over these scarce resources. Demonstration projects will have introduced more efficient and effective approaches for managing natural resources.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0161 Energy and Water  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002 Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds** Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

Prior year unobligated funds include $575,000 of FY 2002 Supplemental - FSA/NIS. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Political process and institutions ($2,900,000 FSA). USAID will continue to facilitate involvement of the public in the legislative process, help initiate important procedural reforms in parliament, and assist in the development of key pieces of democratic legislation. Under rule of law, USAID will upgrade legal education, train lawyers in international and domestic laws, disseminate legal information and adopt ethical codes for legal professionals. USAID will expand its judicial training program to include criminal and non-commercial civil judges. In support of local government and decentralization, USAID will develop new city management tools and citizen participation techniques in 22 Kyrgyz cities and nine villages. Support to NGOs, professional associations, and training institutions will build capacity to advocate for decentralization. With USAID support, a constitutional council is reviewing provisions for greater power sharing between the Presidency and Parliament and promotion of more participatory governance approaches. Principal implementing partners are: Urban Institute, the American Bar Association's Central and East European Law Initiative (ABA/CEELI) (prime), ARD/Checchi (prime), and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) (prime). Civil society ($1,520,000 FSA). The next phase of the civil society program will support a network of at least 10 civil society support centers to provide training seminars, technical support, information resources, networking opportunities, and professional services to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and associations. USAID will support a human rights program to provide training, technical, and financial support to Kyrgyz human rights NGOs. As part of its civic advocacy program, a series of advocacy trainings for approximately 140 key advocacy NGO leaders will be held. Principal implementing partners include: Counterpart (prime), the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) (sub), Freedom House (prime), the National Democratic Institute (prime), and others to be determined through competition. Media and information ($1,180,000 FSA). USAID's media initiative will provide training and assistance to improve the use of modern production technology, and increase the quality of journalism in both print and broadcast media. A production fund will encourage local programming. A legal advisor will provide consultation to alternative media outlets. USAID will continue its high school civics program in 170 schools. A second volume of the civic education textbook will be published in Russian, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek and introduced in 85 additional schools. USAID will sponsor extra-curricular civic activities, such as democracy summer camps, student local government days, and student action committees. USAID will launch a new anti-trafficking program, including an information campaign to inform vulnerable groups   about trafficking ploys and traps. Principal implementing partners are: Internews (grantee), the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) (sub), International Foundation for Election System (IFES) (prime), and others to be determined through competition. FY 2004 Program: Political processes and institutions ($3,576,000 FSA). USAID will strengthen the parliamentary program to help Kyrgyzstanis express and reconcile varying viewpoints. USAID's local government program will help with decentralization and promote transparency in local government through citizen participation techniques. USAID's rule of law program will also continue during FY 2004. Funds will train law students how to think critically and advocate effectively, expose lawyers to international standards of ethical behavior, and assist judges in advocating for judicial independence through judicial associations. Civil society ($1,721,000 FSA). USAID intends to put greater emphasis on improving and increasing NGO advocacy. Also, legislative seminars will be expanded to encourage greater NGO and citizen involvement in the local budget process. Support for human rights advocacy and monitoring will continue in FY 2004. Media and information ($1,324,000 FSA). USAID will continue its civic education, media, and antitrafficking programs to increase quality of information available to the public. The civic education textbook will be introduced into additional schools, and extra-curricular activities such as student action committees and student government days will be replicated. USAID's media efforts will focus on disseminating quality programs as well as ensuring that the public's access to information is increased. The anti-trafficking initiative will continue in FY 2004, focusing on trafficking prevention and prosecution of trafficking offenses. Performance and Results: USAID increased its support for civic advocacy, rule of law, independent media, and local government. USAID bolstered its parliamentary and civic advocacy programs. New components were begun to provide a human rights legal specialist to a legal reform activity. USAID's media partner created a more robust production fund and increased its involvement with regional stations in the southern portion of Kyrgyzstan. USAID strengthened the local government program, promoting responsible city management and citizen participation. NGO advocacy skills improved because of USAIDsponsored trainings (e.g. NGOs, together with legal professionals and media outlets, combined advocacy campaigns to repeal a government decree, which would have curtailed publishing - including the use of personal printers and copy machines - and would have dealt a severe blow to the freedom of speech). Over 800 NGOs and other civil society actors participated in the campaign. The number of students participating in the USAID-sponsored civics course last academic year reached 7,515. Additionally, 716 students participated in extra-curricular civic activities such as student local government days, and democracy summer camps. The poor economic situation and financial instability led many media businesses to accept sponsorship that requires them to publish or air stories that are favorable to the sponsor. On a positive note, the media-training program contributed to the improvement of the technical quality of broadcast news in the past year. Due to USAID's work over the last few years, the Kyrgyz government gave self-governing status to all 22 cities; this led to elections in 12 cities. As a result of USAID technical assistance and training, 82%of Kyrgyz cities improved their democratic practices and public participation. By the end of this objective, USAID expects there will be stronger and more sustainable civic organizations, increased availability of information on civic rights and domestic public issues, enhanced opportunities for citizen participation in governance, and more effective, responsive and accountable public institutions.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0211 Democratic Culture and Institutions  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002* Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds** Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

USAID addresses both the root and immediate causes of potential conflict through its conflict prevention objective. Since many conflicts in Central Asia have arisen at the community (rather than international) level and our ability to change structural factors at the national level is limited, our conflict prevention strategy focuses on giving citizens opportunities to participate in decisions that affect their communities, improve living standards, and provide skills and experience that will diminish the potential for conflict. Community action programs, targeted where risks of communal or religious conflicts are greatest, are designed to increase citizen participation in community decision-making and local government, and contribute to mitigating sources of conflict by promoting economic recovery and inter-ethnic cooperation. Conflict prevention activities began in FY 2002 under the Mission's cross cutting program. As the conflict program will become a separate strategic objective in FY 2004, it is being notified separately for FY 2004 funding. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Conflict prevention ($0 FSA). As FY 2003 will be the transition year for the establishment of a separate strategic objective for conflict prevention, funding for the FY 2003 program activities is being requested under the Mission's cross-cutting program, and is reported in the separate program data sheet for crosscutting program. The principal partner in Kyrgyzstan is ACDI/VOCA (prime). FY 2004 Program: Conflict prevention ($668,000 FSA). Conflict prevention activities will continue in 43 Ferghana Valley and Southern Kyrgyzstan communities, and in new communities identified in the FY 2003 expansion. Emphasis will continue to focus on coordination with other partners to fold in issues of unemployment (especially among urban youth), human rights, and cultural awareness. Performance and Results: USAID rapidly obligated supplemental funds to start conflict prevention activities in five communities in Osh and Uzgen, including small-scale projects in school rehabilitation, condominium heating, and public bath houses with an average direct beneficiary population of about 850. The ""Peaceful Communities Initiative,"" a component of our conflict mitigation program, worked actively with 18 Ferghana Valley communities on the Kyrgyz, Uzbek, and Tajik borders. Two Kyrgyz villages, isolated exclaves within Uzbekistan, worked together to install a gas pipeline for heating and a health clinic. In Jeke-Miste, Kyrgyzstan, and Naiman, Uzbekistan, the neighboring village across the border, a cross border drinking water project was started in August 2002 at a cost of $18,300. The communities contributed 20% and were able to leverage funds from the Soros Foundation to contribute an additional 10%. The total number of beneficiaries in the two communities is 2,500 people. Results indicators, which report on infrastructure projects completed; number of beneficiaries; reduced tension and increased community capacity to identify and solve problems, have been developed. Data collection will begin in late 2002. By the end of the program in 2005, we expect to see approximately 50,000 direct beneficiaries of small-scale, community-driven projects in at least 43 communities. More importantly, though, we   expect that the ties developed through the community strengthening component of this activity will build the capacity for communities to deal with local conflicts on their own before they become serious.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0240 Conflict Prevention  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002 Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

Activities focus on retraining of doctors and nurses in family medicine; implementing incentive-based provider payment systems; helping health sector NGOs to strengthen their organizations; developing pre-service and postgraduate education programs in family medicine, nursing and health care administration; and controlling tuberculosis (TB) by providing in-service training to doctors and laboratory specialists, and improving the monitoring system of TB labs and facilities. Modern surveillance methods are being developed, including a computerized surveillance system. Increased preventive programs by NGOS, marketing condoms, mapping high HIV transmission areas, and introducing a surveillance system targets the concentrated HIV epidemic among high risk groups. Health finance issues have recently emerged as a threat to continuation of the reforms. Prior year unobligated funds include $1,500,000 of FY 2002 Supplemental - FSA/NIS. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Increase the quality of primary health care ($2,203,000 FSA). USAID will promote healthy behaviors with campaigns on diarrhea and breastfeeding and improve interpersonal communication with PHC clients by training health staff. USAID will award local NGOs small grants to implement health projects with communities. At the Kyrgyz State Medical Academy, faculty teaching, research, and evaluation of student clinical skills will be strengthened. USAID will continue the national Family Medicine Residency Program, preparation of nurse faculty for oblast-level in-service education, retraining of family doctors and nurses focused on the south, and establish continuing quality improvement approaches in more PHC clinics. USAID will certify trainers in Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses and roll the program out nationally. The National Family Group Practice Association will be directly supported to provide more member services such as training and to develop its community role. The National Hospital Association will expand training on financial management and begin quality initiative activities. USAID will extend the single payer system to three additional oblasts and train oblast-level Health Insurance Fund staff in hospital payment systems. USAID will start a medical education program and award a new contract to continue PHC work. Principal implementing partners are: Abt Associates (prime), American International Health Alliance (AIHA) (prime), and Counterpart Consortium (prime). Control TB and other infectious diseases ($1,597,000 FSA). USAID will continue training of health staff on the Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) approach. TB specialists will be trained in laboratory diagnosis and use of an electronic surveillance system. The monitoring system for laboratories and facilities will be fortified. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will continue to strengthen the National Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory and will establish a regional training program on blood safety. Two Kyrgyzstanis will be selected for the two-year Applied Epidemiology Program at the Kazakhstan School of Public Health. USAID will respond to the malaria outbreak by developing a regional approach to malaria control including activities in Kyrgyzstan. Principal implementing partners are: CDC (prime) and Project Hope (prime).   Prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS ($200,000 FSA). USAID and CDC are establishing two sentinel surveillance sites in Bishkek and Osh. USAID is collecting behavioral information in high HIV-transmission locations, to better focus AIDS prevention programs in sites where the need is greatest. CDC will initiate a large-scale study of behavioral risk factors, and prevalence of HIV, hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Five HIV/AIDS NGOs will offer basic medical care, free condoms, and referrals to social workers, STI clinics, HIV testing sites, and legal services. Condoms will be marketed to vulnerable young adults, and outreach work to high risk groups will begin. Principal implementing partners are: CDC (prime), Population Services International (PSI) (prime), Soros Foundation (prime), and the University of North Carolina (prime). Improve maternal and child health services ($1,458,000 FSA). USAID will train health staff to better manage obstetric and pre-natal care and expand training on management of serious childhood illnesses. USAID's cross-border Sports and Health Education Project will continue. Principal implementing partners are: Abt Associates (prime) and Project Hope (prime). Supplemental funds will finance a malaria control program; design of a logistics system to channel drug donations through the Health Insurance Fund so more PHC clients get essential drugs; extension of health reform, especially to the south; and establish inexpensive energy efficient systems to reduce astronomic utility bills in select hospitals. FY 2004 Program: Increase the quality of primary health care ($3,235,000 FSA). USAID will continue health promotion activities, training of PHC staff, small grant support to health sector NGOs and medical education efforts. Pilot programs and health care financing will be expanded. AIHA's first five-year cooperative agreement is ending. USAID/W has completed a follow-on agreement and USAID/CAR is currently discussing a new partnership for the country. Control TB and other infectious diseases ($1,245,000 FSA). USAID will train family doctors in diagnosing and treating TB, train monitoring teams at the oblast level, and train specialists in electronic surveillance and laboratory diagnostics. Malaria control activities will continue. USAID will maintain funding for the Applied Epidemiology Program. Prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS ($497,000 FSA). USAID will continue establishing HIV/AIDS surveillance of high-risk groups, will integrate this program with other infectious disease surveillance activities, and continue to improve laboratory diagnostic quality. USAID will continue funding HIV/AIDS NGOs and work to improve their preventive programs. USAID will expand condom social marketing to new sites of high HIV prevalence. Improve maternal and child health services ($1,240,000 FSA). USAID will continue training physicians and nurses to better manage obstetric and pre-natal care and to manage serious childhood illnesses. USAID's cross-border Sports and Health Education Project will continue. Performance and Results: USAID's PHC reform program is now a nationwide system. People increasingly rely on PHC practices for outpatient care, with PHC visits comprising 53.3% of total outpatient visits (44% target). PHC is producing a greater share of total health expenditures, 25% compared with 17% last year. TB deaths are not decreasing but people are successfully being cured. Of those who started treatment in 2000 under the DOTS approach, 72.6% were cured. Five grants were awarded to HIV/AIDS NGOs that work on prevention among high-risk groups. By the end of this objective, USAID will have provided the technical assistance to complete comprehensive reforms and institutionalize a high-quality, cost-effective, and efficient health care system in Kyrgyzstan.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0320 Health and Population  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002 Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds** Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

Beginning in FY 2004, the education program will be funded as a separate strategic objective, for which this program data sheet constitutes initial notification as a separate program. The basic education program will improve in-service teacher training; improve the quality and relevancy of curriculum; increase parent and community involvement in schools; strengthen institutional, management and technical capacity at all levels of the educational system; and improve school infrastructure. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Education ($0 FSA). As FY 2003 will be the transition year for the establishment of a separate strategic objective for education, funding for the FY 2003 education program activities is being requested under the Mission's cross-cutting program, and is reported in the separate program data sheet for cross-cutting program. The prime contractor is the Academy for Educational Development. The Basic Education Program is structured to work at all levels of the system with a targeted number of schools and communities selected as pilot sites to measure the impact of the full range of activities. Training of trainer models will be used to provide curriculum and methodological training to the maximum number of teachers. Capacity building at different levels of the system will develop support for the expansion of successful pilot activities to other areas in the future. Whenever possible, ongoing education activities like civic education, Street Law, Junior Achievement, Step by Step, Reading and Writing for Critical Thinking, and the health education component of the Sports and Health Education Program which are conducted under other strategic objectives will be coordinated with the Basic Education pilot schools to ensure that these schools have access to these curriculum and methodology innovations. A component of the core agreement involves data collection on gender issues in schools, which could be used in the development of future activities designed to address gender issues in basic education. FY 2004 Program: Education ($492,000 FSA). In FY 2004, USAID will continue to solidify the activities begun in FY 2003, described in the above summary. Girls' education will be an important part of the program. Small grants may be given to active, competent local education NGOs. An assessment of the program is planned in FY 2004. Funding for individual activities will be identified during the course of FY 2003. Performance and Results: Supplemental funding allowed USAID to begin a program in the education sector. Performance indicators for the education program activities will be developed during the first three months of calendar year 2003, and data collection will begin in the summer of 2003.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0340 Strengthened Basic Education Sector  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002 Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

Supplemental funding was critical for an expansion of conflict prevention activities in southern Kyrgyzstan, as well as for the development of the basic education program. Prior year unobligated funds include $8,230,000 of FY 2002 Supplemental - FSA/NIS. Inputs, Outputs, Activities: FY 2003 Program: Conflict prevention ($400,000 FSA). USAID will expand activities beyond the initial 43 communities in southern Kyrgyzstan and the Ferghana Valley, and will equalize focus between rural and urban settings, especially in Osh and Batken areas and in the border and transit areas. Coordination with other partners will fold in issues of unemployment, human rights, and cultural awareness. Although none of these conflict prevention activities will, in and of themselves, end conflict or extremism in Central Asia, they will serve as a focal point for the USG's efforts to prevent potentially violent discord in the country. ACDI/VOCA is the chief implementer in Kyrgyzstan. Basic education ($600,000 FSA). USAID will support basic education in selected school areas to improve overall quality of primary and secondary education through improved in-service teacher training; improved curriculum quality; increased parent and community involvement in schools; strengthened institutional, management, and technical capacity at all levels of the educational system; and improved school infrastructure. Girls' education will be an important feature of the activity. Implementers will be selected by the beginning of calendar year 2003. American University of Central Asia ($0 FSA). Supplemental funds were used to support an endowment jointly funded by USAID and the Open Society Institute for the American University of Central Asia (AUCA) in Bishkek. This will ensure that AUCA permanently serves as a model of democratic culture, institutional integrity, and international educational standards for undergraduate students throughout Central Asia. Participant training ($650,000 FSA). More than 2,000 participants will be trained during FY 2003. Training will support fiscal and tax reform, small/medium enterprise development, local governance, health-care reform, energy and water resources, conflict resolution, education reform, and crosscutting objectives. The focus will shift to reporting on results and achievements. The principal implementing partner is the Academy for Educational Development.   Eurasia Foundation ($1,350,000 FSA). The Kyrgyz office is the Foundation's first grant-making office with a fully local staff, and is seen as an important step toward the Foundation's long-term goal of establishing local foundations throughout the former Soviet Union. Grants will support three main program directions: the ""Ferghana Valley Initiative"" to forge cross-border connections in this politically sensitive area; legal consultation services; and ""The Local Governance Initiative"" with the Urban Institute to help make local government more effective and transparent. Program support ($107,000 FSA). Funding will provide for a range of support activities to the program. As required, funding will enable USG to support unanticipated opportunities to advance or reinforce USAID objectives. An evaluation of the ten-year participant training program and a region wide gender training program will be conducted. Program personnel essential to the implementation of activities will be supported. FY 2004 Program: Participant training ($1,200,000 NOA). USAID's participant training activity will continue to focus on SME development, democratic reform, local governance, and health-care reform. Cost-effective in-country training programs will be emphasized. Eurasia Foundation ($1,000,000 NOA). Eurasia Foundation will provide grants for private enterprise, civil society, and public administration NGOs in addition to those areas described above. Program support ($192,000 FSA). A wide range of program and personnel support activities will continue. It is anticipated that funding will support various assessments in anticipation of a new strategy for 2005. Performance and Results: USAID rapidly obligated supplemental funds to start conflict prevention activities in five communities in Osh and Uzgen, including small-scale projects in school rehabilitation, condominium heating, and public bath houses with an average direct beneficiary population of about 850 each. The Peaceful Communities Initiative, also a component of our conflict mitigation program, worked actively with 18 Ferghana Valley communities on the Kyrgyz, Uzbek, and Tajik borders. Two Kyrgyz villages, isolated within Uzbekistan, worked together to install a gas pipeline for heating and a health clinic. In Jeke-Miste, Kyrgyzstan, and Naiman, Uzbekistan, the neighboring village across the border, a cross border drinking water project was started. The total number of beneficiaries in the two communities is 2,500 people. Results indicators, which report on infrastructure projects completed; number of beneficiaries; reduced tension and increased community capacity to identify and solve problems, have been developed. Data collection will begin late winter. In FY 2002, USAID trained over 2,000 Kyrgyzstani citizens (50% women). USAID organized the first parliamentary budget hearing, in which NGOs and citizens expressed concerns about the national budget process. The Budget Committee chair held a second public hearing and remains committed to conducting hearings on a quarterly basis. Performance indicators for the education program activities will be developed during the first three months of the activity, and data collection will begin in the summer of 2003. Eurasia's 31 grants to Kyrgyzstani NGOs in FY 2002 ($13,000 average grant size) complement USAID programs in the economic and democracy sectors. Half of these grant funds supported civil society development, with the remainder targeting improvements in the areas of private enterprise, public policy, and administration. With the support of a $17,000 grant from the Eurasia Foundation in FY 2002, the Association for Social Protection, which assists and protects the elderly and infirm and is run by pensioners, has held a series of public hearings that bring Kyrgyzstan's elderly together with officials from both government and public utilities. Meetings have resulted in the setting of subsidies for medication and utilities for most of Kyrgyzstan's elderly. By the end of the conflict program in 2005, approximately 50,000 people will directly benefit from small-scale, community-driven projects in at least 43 communities.   US Financing in Thousands of Dollars Kyrgyzstan  116-0420 Cross-Cutting Programs  ESF  FSA  Through September 30, 2001 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Fiscal Year 2002 Obligations Expenditures Through September 30, 2002 Obligations Expenditures Unliquidated Prior Year Unobligated Funds** Obligations Planned Fiscal Year 2003 NOA Obligations Total Planned Fiscal Year 2003 Obligations Proposed Fiscal Year 2004 NOA Obligations Future Obligations Est.

Training and exchanges cut across all sectors and continue to support USAID's technical assistance programs in areas directly relevant to the transition to democracy and a free-market economy.  Training is provided via short-term training courses in the United States, in-country and in third countries. Support to the Eurasia Foundation provides training and sub-grants for business education and development.  In addition, this objective provides activity development and support for all strategic objectives. Special studies and evaluations are conducted to manage, monitor and measure impact of on-going programs.    Program Categories  include support for participant training, program development support, evaluation and the Eurasia Foundation.    Key Results : USAID carefully selects training participants and training courses that improve the capacity and skills of key individuals that support USAID's six strategic objectives: improved environment for the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, strengthened democratic culture, improved management of critical natural resources, increased access to quality primary health care, increased soundness of tax and budget policies and administration and more effective, responsive and accountable local governance.     Performance and Prospects : USAID continues placing a greater emphasis on more cost-effective in-country training programs and on training trainers rather than simply training individual participants. More than 1,200 decision-makers, professionals and citizen leaders of Kyrgyzstan were trained in FY 2000. Many of the participants return to their home country and make positive changes in their communities as a result of their training.  After exposure to scientific breakthroughs during a training course on epidemiology in Atlanta, the Head of Kyrgyzstan's viral hepatitis laboratory created a new, more accurate method of epidemiological control, which was adopted by the Government in January 2000.  After training in the U.S., another participant shared his newly acquired knowledge by producing a brochure outlining the advantages of establishing a water user association in the countryside. He distributed the first 100 copies of the brochure to water user associations free of charge.     A three-week small and medium enterprise (SME) development program in Israel provided methods and techniques to better enable decision-makers in local and national governments, as well as in businesses and banks, to appropriately allocate their financial and human resources.  This, in turn will stimulate local entrepreneurs to invest in and manage new businesses and industries and to compete in national markets.  The ultimate goal of this is to transform the Central Asian republics into market-and consumer-driven economies responsive to the needs of citizens.  One participant organized a training program on business planning to explain the critical role of small business in the economic growth and development of transition countries.    Regionally, Kyrgystan has benefited from training provided by the Eurasia Foundation in business development and sub-grants to support non-governmental organizations (NGO) training.    In FY 2001,  USAID intends to obligate following amounts per category:  Participant Training, $1,500,000, for training of individuals and groups; Program Development Support, $1,000,000, for special studies and evaluations; and the Eurasia Foundation, $1,250,000, for NGO strengthening and NGO training.    In FY 2001 USAID will expand participant training activities along with additional support to the Eurasia Foundation.    Beneficiaries :  Citizens of Kyrgyzstan    Possible Adjustments to Plans : None anticipated.    Other Donor Programs : Other donors working in the field of training, exchanges and education include European Union-Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States (EU-TACIS), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Asian Development Bank, Soros, the British Council and the World Bank. The training program collaborates with U.S. Embassy Public Diplomacy office and U.S. Foreign Commercial Service to maximize the use of expertise and resources.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies : The Academy for Educational Development is the principal contractor for training and exchanges.  The Eurasia Foundation provides small grants to NGOs for training and development.    Selected Performance Measures:  Due to the cross-cutting nature of these activities, reults are captured and reported on under other strategic objectives.

GX030-57-6952781	Kyrgyzstan          >> Regional Overview    >> Kyrgyzstan Overview          Activity Data Sheet   PROGRAM:   Kyrgyzstan   TITLE & NUMBER:   Improved Environment for the Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises, 116-0131   STATUS:   New   PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $7,200,000 FSA   PROPOSED FY 2002 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $7,000,000 FSA   INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 2001   ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 2005    Summary : This SO includes funds previously reported under SO 1.4.  The goal of this objective is to stimulate growth of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector by improving the business environment.  USAID will pursue this goal by: 1) providing greater opportunities to gain skills and knowledge that enhance SME growth; 2) developing mechanisms to provide for the accumulation and distribution of capital needed to finance SMEs, and increase the opportunity of businesses to gain access to credit; and 3) providing assistance targeted at increasing laws and regulations that support SME growth.    Program Categories  include support for micro, small and medium enterprise technical assistance; banking reform; education and support for rule of law.    Key Results : Key results necessary to achieve this objective are: 1) increased opportunity to acquire business information, knowledge, and skills; 2) more responsive financial institutions, instruments, and markets; and 3) increased implementation of laws and regulations.    Performance and Prospects : The operating environment for SMEs in Kyrgyzstan improved during FY 2000 with the passage of key regulations and laws. With USAID guidance, the GOK passed a decree requiring full compliance with international accounting standards (IAS) and international standards of auditing (ISA).  In addition, the government passed a law that decreased by 65% the number of licenses required by businesses.    USAID continued to focus attention on training, again far exceeding established benchmarks.  A total of 5,048 accounting practitioners and 10,500 students are now trained in financial accounting, managerial accounting, and audit. Two hundred civil servants are now trained in tax inspection, and approximately 2,000 farmers now understand their land rights.    At the end of 2000, with USAID support, the Kyrgyz Government signed a new land law allowing the free sale of land.  USAID had notable successes in other areas of legal reform as well.  USAID launched a program to create a public database of judicial opinions, which will subject the work of courts to public scrutiny and force them to operate with more transparency, consistency, and predictability.    In 2000 USAID provided significant assistance in the passage of key World Trade Organization (WTO)-compliant regulations and laws, including a Customs regulation regarding intellectual property rights and a regulation on trademarks. USAID assistance resulted in the development of a Customs Reform and Modernization Plan, approved by the Kyrgyz government in August 2000, and the formation of an External Control Department (Audit Team).  USAID worked to ensure the sustainability of these efforts through training of civil servants on WTO and Customs issues, the establishment of the WTO and Trade Information Center at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry, and the creation of a Ministry of Foreign Trade internet site.    During FY 2000, USAID completed its Kyrgyz bank accounting reform.  All Kyrgyz banks have now been converted to international accounting standards. In response to a request from the National Bank, USAID began providing banking supervision assistance during 2000.  USAID helped the National Bank to improve the on-site inspection process, complete an inspection manual, and train inspectors to conduct risk-based evaluations of commercial banks. Moreover, USAID helped the National Bank to develop and implement an off-site monitoring system.    Activities to strengthen the financial sector and improve access to credit were successful, as USAID's micro-lending programs grew steadily into sustainable institutions that meet the demands of small business. More than $12.5 million in micro-credit was disbursed in FY 2000 to more than 25,333 clients. More stringent capital requirements have helped generate an increase in total bank capital from $14 million to $17 million.    In FY 2001, USAID will undertake a broad expansion into SME training and economic education initiatives.  Currently, business and economics programs in Kyrgyzstan are not teaching future business leaders the knowledge and skills needed to operate in a market economy.  The upcoming Regional Economics and Business Education activity will provide increased opportunities for access to business and economic information through improved resource materials, training, and research opportunities at universities in Kyrgyzstan.    The new SME training activity will develop courses in a wide range of business topics, provide business advisory services and facilitate business association and advocacy development.  Thus far, the project has delivered courses in finance, credit, accounting, and marketing strategy.  This activity also includes a Business Advisory Services component that has already completed assessments of 120 businesses.    For the planned activities, involving technical assistance and training, USAID intends to obligate in FY 2001 the following amounts per category:  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Technical Assistance, $2,420,000; Banking Reform, $500,000; Education $620,000 and Support for Rule of Law, $3,660,000.    In 2002, USAID will continue to work together with private sector and government to create freer markets where micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises can thrive.  This effort to expand business and trade will include removing licensing/regulatory restraints, increasing access to credit, and expanding business skills and knowledge.  USAID will work selectively with the Government to develop the stock market and to strengthen banking by providing off-site technical assistance, previously provided by the IMF.  Also, USAID plans to concentrate on economics and business education, basic business management skills, and consulting services to business through Business Advisory Centers.  USAID will continue to provide critical post-World Trade Organization (WTO) accession support to ensure that WTO obligations and requirements are fulfilled and will determine a timeframe for Kyrgyzstan's graduation from WTO assistance.  Further training will be provided to professionals and farmers to increase awareness of private land ownership laws.     Beneficiaries : USAID's customer focus is job creation, economic growth, greater participation, and improved quality of life for the citizens of Kyrgyzstan. As such, the ultimate beneficiaries are entrepreneurs who can increase profitability, and those individuals who secure new employment. Furthermore, by expanding economic opportunity and building a constituency for reform, such a program can mitigate political and economic crises in key parts of the region, such as the Ferghana Valley.    Possible Adjustments to Plans : None anticipated.    Other Donor Programs : The World Bank, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the British Department for International Development are supporting land reform. The Dutch Centre for International Legal Cooperation is supporting judicial reform, civil code commentaries and training in legislative drafting. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is implementing an SME Lending Program, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is implementing a Financial Sector Program.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies : Pragma Corporation implemented the SME training activity. ARD/Checchi and Chemonics implemented the regulatory reform activity. Booz-Allen & Hamilton was responsible for delivering WTO and customs assistance. Barents implemented the banking supervision activity. The Academy for Educational Development provided training for counterparts, and the Eurasia Foundation provided small grants. Central Asian-American Enterprise Fund (CAAEF) and Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) such as Citizens' Democracy Corps (CDC), International Executive Service Corps (IESC), Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), Mercy Corps, and Agricultural Cooperative Development Institute/Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (ACDI/VOCA ) provided financial and technical assistance, respectively.

GX026-25-1505360	"Kyrgyzstan              >> Regional Overview    >> Kyrgyzstan Overview             Program Data Sheet 116-0161       USAID MISSION:   Kyrgyzstan   PROGRAM TITLE AND NUMBER:  Energy and Water (Pillar: Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade)   STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE:  Improved Management of Critical Natural Resources, including Energy; 116-0161   STATUS:  Continuing   PLANNED FY 2002 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:  $1,500,000 FSA    PRIOR YEAR UNOBLIGATED AND FUNDING SOURCE:  $100,000 FSA   PROPOSED FY 2003 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:  $1,700,000 FSA   INITIAL OBLIGATION:  FY 2000      ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:  FY 2005    Summary:  As an important source of water for the CAR region, Kyrgyzstan's management of water is key to its own energy development needs and to transboundary cooperation. Major components of the USAID program are:     training for water, energy and meteorological officials and managers;   installation of sustainable, affordable energy efficiency and on-farm water management models that demonstrate new, more efficient technology and management techniques;   improving the policy and regulatory framework, especially in the hydropower and transboundary water sectors; and   developing public commitment to improve the process of energy privatization.      Inputs, Outputs, and Activities:   FY 2002 Program:  USAID will provide training to natural resources officials to improve resource management.  To complement and reinforce this training, models will be developed and tested to demonstrate the viability of new management concepts and technologies.  Trans-boundary activities focused on regional water management will include training in the use and maintenance of new technologies and procedures for snowmelt forecasting and regional data sharing, which will help regional officials to improve their planning for water allocation.  Specifically, USAID will focus on improving the capability of the Kyrgyz National Hydromet Service (NHS) to better collect, process and transmit critical water data as part of a regional program. Two meteorological stations will be installed in a critical high altitude region for better collection of water and weather data. USAID will also fund an improved communication system that will facilitate the flow of critical water information between water managers. Pilot heating projects will demonstrate the efficacy of simple, inexpensive technologies in promoting energy conservation and cost savings.     SUBMISSION OF THIS PROGRAM DATA SHEET CONSTITUTES FORMAL RENOTIFICATION OF USAID'S INTENT TO OBLIGATE FY 2002 RESOURCES FOR THE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE    Planned FY 2003 Program:   The USAID water program will focus on improving the capability of the Kyrgyz National Hydromet Service (NHS) to better collect, process and transmit critical water data as part of a regional program. Assistance will take the form of improved equipment and training programs for modeling of water runoff from snowmelt in order to facilitate planning and water allocations. In support of this activity, two meteorological stations will be installed in critical high altitude regions and a third in Bishkek, for better collection of water and weather data. USAID will also fund an improved communication system that will facilitate the flow of critical water information between water managers. Complementary training to energy officials will also support this effort. This activity will also provide a stronger, more objective basis for Kyrgyz decision- and policy-makers with regard to sensitive transboundary water and energy agreements in cooperation with counterparts in other Central Asian nations. Due to the important role Kyrgyzstan plays as a source for regional water for downstream countries, the USAID transboundary water and related energy cooperation activity will be centered in Kyrgyzstan.    USAID assistance has increased public participation that has led to  simplified billing procedures that will reduce corruption.   Pilot programs demonstrating efficient water management practices for the on-farm level will also be implemented whereby local water user groups, using simple technology can assess and communicate their water needs more accurately. USAID will continue to work with the State Energy Agency, the independent regulator of the electric sector of Kyrgyzstan, to establish a transparent, equitable tariff structure for energy services, encourage independent local utilities, and hold regular public hearings. In addition, demonstration projects in heating efficiency will be initiated in schools and other public buildings.    Performance and Results:  Due to USAID-brokered agreements and the continued focus on training and study tours, USAID has played a key role in ensuring that water agreements meet international standards, and in providing an objective basis for decision-making. Staff of Kyrgyzstan's NHS are knowledgeable participants in the regional snowmelt runoff committee that meets semi-annually to improve water allocations for Central Asia. They have also begun collecting and processing water data for which USAID provided equipment and training. Several water courses were funded by USAID in cooperation with the Canadian Agency for International Development, through which Kyrgyz water officials and managers could better acquainted themselves with international water law, transboundary water management, and integrated water practices to improve irrigation efficiency.     This year, the Government of Kyrgyzstan took an important step in the privatization of its state-owned energy system by ""unbundling"" the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical services. The resulting new companies all fall under the purview of the State Energy Agency. USAID has assisted energy officials in the privatization process for the past six years, and in a political and economic environment that has been extremely resistant to reform, this is viewed as an important development. Due to USAID assistance, public participation has increased in the government energy sector resulting in simplified procedures in billing and other practices aimed at reducing corruption.     The heating pilot is well underway in Kyrgyzstan, and we expect that data will be collected this winter that will prove its cost-effectiveness for replication.    On-farm water management demonstrations will begin this spring, thus there are no results to date.    By the completion date of the activity, water managers should have the necessary tools and training to better collect, communicate and process water data resulting in improved allocations and overall management of the resource. Also, water and energy agreements will be based more on objective  data and standards, thereby mitigating their potential for conflict.

This law eliminated the Social Security earnings test for recipients between the ""full retirement age"" (currently age 65 and eight months) and age 70.   Unfortunately, individuals who retire at age 62 are still penalized.  This legislation would correct this inequity by repealing the earnings test for all seniors who choose to work.       While this law was a great victory for seniors who chose to work once they reached retirement age, it does not eliminate the earnings test for seniors who choose to retire early at age 62, added Green.   ""It is time to extend fairness to all seniors.""   ###                   Print this page"
GX151-76-8210467	"TRANSCRIPT  of   Congressman Ed Pastor's  ""Special Report from Washington"" Show #3  Taped Feb. 14, 2002  Broadcast on PHXCH11, Phoenix, Arizona  Segment 1 Guest: Congressman Henry Waxman, Representative from California, Ranking Member of the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform; Topic: Enron Investigation     Segment 1            EP: Greetings,  welcome again to our program. This is our report from Washington, D.C.  I hope that the program has been informative and you are learning a lot about the inner workings of Congress in Washington.  Today we are going to be very lucky because you have seen this person on Meet the Press, on CNN, on probably every major talk show there is. He has talked about improving healthcare.  He has talked about the ills of tobacco. He has taken on the tobacco industry and chastised CEOs. And today we are very lucky to have him. He comes from the twenty ninth district in California. Beverly Hills, I believe, or somewhere close to that area. He has been in Congress for a few years. A very respected member of Congress. So, please welcome with a warm Arizona applause, Henry Waxman. Henry welcome to the show.   HW: Thank you ver much. I just feel that warm greeting from the people in Arizona.   EP: And I tell you what;  I think they are going to be very happy to see this show because I have been telling people, giving them a preview, that the big issue the last couple of weeks has been Enron.  Everybody is running away from Enron. You have people saying that they treated their pensioners very badly. The issue of Arthur Anderson and what is the responsibility of an auditing firm. What is going to happen to these guys that are taking the fifth, and probably drinking a fifth before they come to Congress?  And you are right in the middle of it. So from this experience, this bankruptcy, we can think of major issues that we need to look at and maybe come to some resolution.   HW: Ed, you have got to just step back and realize the magnitude of this whole issue. Enron was supposed to have been the seventh largest corporation in the country; bigger than IBM, bigger than AT&T, and then suddenly collapsed and went into bankruptcy. In the process,  the workers and the investors had their financial security just robbed from them. And the insiders who are well connected, walked away with over a billion dollars.   EP: Wow.   HW: So if you look at something like this, you have to say, "" How could something like this happen? Who did it? How did it happen? How can we prevent it from happening in the future? And who enabled it to happen?"".  There have been some hearings on the hill about the Enron debacle and they have gone around in circles. We have had a lot of the executives come in and take the fifth amendment as you mentioned.  Which is probably wise for them because they are going to be facing criminal charges, or may well face criminal charges.  Anything they say in a Congressional hearing is going to be used against them. Of course,  we wouldn't give them immunity....    EP: Let me ask you a question on that one.  The Attorney General, has accused himself,  said, ""I as a senator I received contributions and so therefore,  hands off I have a conflict ."" Do you think the Department of Justice will look at that case and look at it as if it was ‘Joe Sixpack',  who obviously has all the rights?  But do you think we are going to look at it fairly and come up with some conclusions?  And if they need to be punished it will happen?    HW: I hope so, but it makes me nervous. The Attorney General has accused himself, after we wrote him a letter pointing out that his single largest contributor when he ran for re-election for the Senate was Enron.    EP: Ok.   HW: And the other people who are the political ones who are appointed at the Justice Department, appointed by the Bush administration. Well wait a minute, Enron was the largest single contributor to President Bush's political efforts. Number two was Arthur Anderson.  Number three was the law firm that represented Enron. So they had a lot of very strong and intimate ties with this administration. But then we've got to hope that the people in the Justice Department are going to do an honest job. They are professionals. They are going to examine the law and the facts, and if there is wrongdoing we hope they will pursue it and bring people to justice. I want to know if the criminal laws have been violated. But it just can't, in my mind, not be a crime when insiders are able to loot the company and take it from the people who have so little and just take it all away from them, their jobs and their investments.    EP: It is a great loss. I know that we have had a number of the people who worked for Enron have been coming to Washington. Have any of them participated in any of the hearings that you have held, or you've been involved in?   HW: Some have been in the audience, some have been meeting with us privately. There was a hearing,  I know,  in the Senate where they had some of Enron employees testify to what happened to them. They weren't given any notice at all. They were told, ""Pack up, this is it we are closing the company."" And many of them had all their life savings in Enron stock. Within a short period of time before the company cratered, Ken Lay,  who is the CEO of Enron,  was out telling everyone what a great investment this is. ""This stock is going to go up. Buy more. You don't need to put your investment funds into anything else but Enron."" And in fact,  at the very end they locked them out, or locked them in to that stock, so that they couldn't even get out of their Enron stocks if they wanted to. That didn't apply to the executives, but it certainly applied to the workers at Enron and their 401K funds all in the Enron stock.   EP: Well I have heard, in fact the other day at breakfast some members--both Republicans and Democrats--were discussing when an employee gets stock as part of the pension package what control should that employee have over what happens to that stock.  Dana Rohrabacher from California said, ""Well, since it is their money maybe they should have a greater authority in terms of what happens to that stock."" And I found it very interesting because George Miller was sitting at the table and he is saying, . . . well there are some commonalities.  So I think this is an issue that has to be bipartisan. In terms of what a pensioner has in terms of controlling his pension and stock.    HW: I think there are some minimal things that Democrats and Republicans will agree on. One is that the Captain of the ship aught to be treated the same as the employees on the ship. . . .   EP: O.K..   HW: And we shouldn't  let them opt out and sell their stock and then the workers can't. Secondly, employees should be able to control their 401ks'. They ought to be able to get in and out of whatever stock they want. Most financial advisors tell people that they should have a well diversified portfolio. One of the reasons Enron has reverberated around the country--and there are many--but one is the whole trend for workers has been to have the employers provide a certain amount of money to match what they put into a retirement fund. And then the employer says that's it, that is all they are going to do. It used to be that if you worked for a company for twenty years;  and there are still some around,  but most of the time they are not providing those kinds of pensions, you had a guaranteed benefit . Now they have a guaranteed contribution from your employer, but no more than that. And that shifts the burden, all the risks on to the (unclear).  Now if the stock markets do well over a period of the time, which is what they say will generally happen in this country and workers can come out reasonably well off. But it does shift the risk to the workers.  And if the stock market is rigged because you have accounting firms that don't tell you the truth, you have corporations that shift their losses off to other partnerships, which is what Enron did. And we found at one of our hearings that that is not unusual. But somebody else would carry the losses, so it looks like sure stock. It was a great money making enterprise so it makes it look attractive when in fact you could be bankrupt, which is what happened with Enron. Which is what happened with this global, I can't think of the name of it, the company out in my own area in California, Global Crossing. Same kind of thing.  You don't see the downside.  You don't get the full, real, honest picture of what you are investing in when you buy the stock with the company.  And you have all these ways of keeping it from the public and the investors. I worry about what happened to the Enron employees and investors, but I worry about the lack of confidence in our whole markets because it is based on a certain amount of trust, and if you don't trust accountants because they have a conflict of interest you don't trust the corporations because they can play games and after a while you say, ""Well maybe we shouldn't be investing."". And that can have terrible economic consequences for the country.    EP: The little I know about this is that Arthur Anderson not only was the accountant, but also was a consultant . And so maybe by the two roles there might have been a built-in conflict of interest.     HW: Well there was a clear conflict of interest. They could make more money as consultants than they can as auditors and they don't want to say anything as auditors that might jeopardize their role as consultants. This is not a new issue. This issue has been around, and people in the Securities Exchange Commission recommended we change the law to prevent this kind of conflict. I think there is another side of this Enron story. Bills will enable this to happen. A lot of our colleagues  went to bat for the accounting industry which gave a lot of money to politicians and they stopped regulations from going into effect to prevent these kinds of conflicts. Some of the people who stopped those regulations, those consumer protections, now are saying, ""Oh my god what a terrible thing has happened."". Well they should have foreseen it. It is not the first time this sort of thing has happened. It should have been stopped before we got to the situation we now have with Enron.    EP: Well do you think that we here in Congress will re-look at that issue and say we have this example . . .  I tell you what, in Arizona we have the Baptist Foundation, you may be familiar with it, Arthur Anderson happens to be the accountant and again people did not have the entire information on how the stock was doing. I believe in that case that the accountant was also the consultant. Do you think here in Congress we will begin addressing that and go back to some of  the regulations that you've talked about?  Maybe look at it with some seriousness now.    HW: I sure hope so. Arthur Levitt was the head of the Securities Exchange Commission under President Clinton. He made a clear recommendation that we change the law in this regard. His regulations were stopped by congressmen who would not let it go into effect. But when he came to testify before the Senate after the Enron debacle, senators came up to him and said, ""You were right and we were wrong."". Some of who had tried to stop, or in fact watered down, his proposals. So I hope that Congress will change the law on this.    EP: Well I hope so also.   Obviously,  I remember when you looked to an accounting firm and it was basically to deal with your books and if you were not doing it quite right they would give you a management letter. Very rarely were they involved also in another conflict of interest were they had a consultant type interest. Well it is going to be interesting I think. But now with the passage of campaign reform maybe the pull of soft money will . . . and I think Enron caused this bill to pass in the House. I think that was a great emphasis. We have about a minute Henry.   HW: I think you are so right about that connection between campaign reform and what happened with Enron because Enron was such a heavy political player with soft money, mainly to the Republicans, but some to Democrats as well. That it really meant to all of us in Congress, especially those who have never supported the (unclear) like you and I, have been on the forefront of this issue. But some of them didn't want to be voting against reform and that is why the House has passed a bill for that.    EP: Well I know some of my friends are adding some of the contributions to the employee pension fund, or whatever fund that is out there. It is a great tragedy in our lives today that this big corporation that started with a pipe line company, became the seventh largest corporation and just in a matter of weeks, or less than that,  disappeared.   HW: Well they weren't in energy anymore . . .    EP: No, right.    HW: Trading, and they got all sorts of exceptions to the laws so they could trade without any government regulation or oversight. They were free to do what they wanted, and what they did was took a lot of people to the bath.   EP: Yeah. We are going to take a short break. We will be coming back to Henry Waxman to continue talking about Enron. As we get to the latter part of the show maybe we can get him to talk about some of the things the Congress will be looking at as to concerns with health issues.    Segment 2       EP: Welcome again. Today we have Henry Waxman who you have seen on ‘Meet the Press' and today you are seeing him on our program. We are discussing Enron and some of the fallout with the Enron bankruptcy. Henry is right in the middle of the hearings. One of the issues, Henry, that all of know about is that Enron was an active player when this administration, when the Vice President, was developing the energy policy. It is my understanding that the GAO has taken the Vice President to court to get some of the paperwork that resulted from this task force. What are your comments on that particular case?   HW: I think we have to look back and remember that in the year 2001 there was no corporation in America that was better connected politically with this administration, then Enron and Ken Lay, who was the CEO of Enron. Ken Lay was considered by the President and the Vice President as an intimate friend. He was the President's biggest campaign contributor. He was on the phone whenever he wanted to be with the President and the Vice President. When the Vice President organized a task force to develop energy policy, Ken Lay was in there all the time. Whenever he felt like weighing in, telling them what he felt their energy policy ought to be. In fact, when the President had to appoint people to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the commission that regulates the energy industry, Ken Lay was the one who backed the guy who became the chairmen of the FERC. He was from Texas. He was close to Ken Lay and Enron, and he got to be chairman because of that fact. Ken Lay recommended that President Bush appoint him, and he did. So they were very well connected. The Vice President had a task force and he had a lot of different interest groups coming in and urging policies.  This is not so unusual. We asked the General Accounting Office, which is a non-partisan organization, a watchdog agency for the Congress, to find out who all came to that task force. I would like to know what they asked for. It may be special interest groups, lobbyists, campaign contributors. So, the GAO thought that was a worthy thing to do. When President Clinton had a task force on healthcare policy and he appointed his wife some of the Republicans asked the GAO to find out information about that task force. They asked the Clinton administration to give them all the records and the Clinton administration didn't want to at first but they did. Well Vice President Cheney when he had the request from the General Accounting office last spring, said no. He just wouldn't give them any of the information. He just absolutely stonewalled. When Enron collapsed we went back and said to the GAO,  it is even more important that we know now.  Not just about Enron, which is such a significant player in energy policy, but who else was a significant player. And the General Accounting Office agreed with us that this is a matter of principle for the Congress to exercise its oversight over what is happening at the Executive Branch. The public's right to know how government functions. It is inconsistent with our democratic society to have a government agency, or the Vice President of the United States, head up a task force and the public wouldn't even know who came in and made presentations in this task force. Vice President Cheney said, ""Well this is going to mean that I have to give out every person that I ever meet with and they won't give me their honest opinions on things.""  Well no one asked for every person he ever met with. It was only in the capacity  as Chairman of this task force that the General Accounting Office wanted information.  The Vice President stonewalled it. Now the General Accounting Office is going to sue, which is unprecedented,  but they are going to take the Vice President to court in order to try to get this information.  I am astonished that Cheney would do this. It is almost routine that this kind of information has been made available in the past. Republicans had ten separate investigations where they demanded information from the Clinton administration. They were trying to investigate the Clinton administration maybe ties to campaign contributors. They were never able to connect it, but they made the administration give them all the documents. That is legitimate. You hope they do something more worthwhile then go on a fishing expedition. But the Congress is entitled to it and this is not the Democrats or the Republicans, it is the General Accounting Office which is a non partisan agency that is now filing a law suit against the Vice President.    EP: Well, you hear this argument.   I think I am going to use the right words, executive privilege, that in the past the executive prior administrations have eroded the this principle of the executive privilege. Now we are going to test it. I guess the Vice President said that he may want to test that. Now do you think the principal of executive privilege is still greater than the ability of the public to know what happened, especially on energy policy?    HW: Well they have argued as if it were executive privilege, but that is not what they are using as a defense against the request from the General Accounting Office. Executive privilege usually means when the President brings in his staff, when he brings in the Secretary of Defense, when he brings in the Secretary of Health and Human Services;  he wants their guidance and he has talked through with them as his advisors what policy he is going to pursue. That should be protected. That is executive privilege. But we are not talking about information and advice to the Vice President in this case from his staff. We are talking about people who are lobbyists for these special interest groups outside groups completely. And there is no executive privilege that would apply to that. They are not even advancing that argument in court. They are trying to pretend that that is the argument, they cloak it as if it were executive privilege. I respect the idea of executive privilege, but I don't think it applies in this precise instance.   EP: If I remember, this task force was meeting when California was having its problems. And I remember that in Arizona we were talking about an energy crisis, and this nation was talking about an energy crisis. So whatever policy was evolving, it was very important, not only for California,  Arizona, but it was a national policy. So I would think that the public would ask what input was given and what resulted from that input.    HW: Well I sent a letter to Vice President Cheney saying, ""What contacts did you have with Ken Lay and Enron?"". He wrote me a letter back saying, ""I don't have to tell you, but I will tell you that I had six different meetings with Ken Lay."" One of those meetings was around the time California was pleading with the federal government to do something to restrain runaway wholesale energy costs. (Unclear) had the legislature adopt an incredibly stupid law, which Ken Lay went to Sacramento and advocated for deregulation. They call it deregulation. The consumer is going to benefit from deregulating competition. What happened was that the market became so dysfunctional that Enron and Dynegy and other companies could just hold back. They could say, ""Well we have to close some of our plants for repairs."" . And then the shortages would drive up the price and the state had to buy whatever energy they had available at the price, that day's price . . . .   EP: That day's price, right.    HW: So they said deregulation was going to benefit consumers.  It turned out it was for their own benefit.  And they just were able to rip off the rate payers and the tax payers in California.  And hurt all of us in the West because we are all connected.  So, Ken Lay met with the Vice President and urged him to oppose any relief for California.  A couple days later, the Vice President went on the air and announced that he is supporting the Enron policy. He was asked, ""What is the Enron policy?"". He said, ""Well I am against any kind of caps on energy prices."" Now I will grant that he might have been sincere about it, but he came out right after Ken Lay talked to him. Ken Lay had this access that was extraordinary, and this was the guy that who led the Enron debacle; led Enron into this debacle that has hurt so many people. He has walked away pretty comfortably off.   EP: Well Henry I have to tell you, I can't remember the show, but his wife was on the show and said that he no longer had money available for the grand children's education and they were going to be homeless and they were losing their houses. But reports after that say that they have a few million dollars stashed away. So I guess it is all relative, if you had several hundred millions of dollars and you are down to a few million then poverty has begun. Hopefully . . .    HW: Now a  billion and you are down to a couple hundred . . .    EP: a couple hundred, exactly. Well Henry I want to thank you for being on the show and I know that your friends in Phoenix are going to enjoy seeing you. We look forward to seeing you on the committee as we go through the investigations. I know that, as a champion of the people, you will be looking out for our interests.

GX111-26-4356925	"Ferraro on Women in Politics      Sorry, you need a JavaScript capable browser to get the best from this page             All Women Win When a Woman Runs for Political   Office Geraldine Ferraro addresses African Women's   conference    By Charles W. Corey    USIA Staff Writer                 WASHINGTON -- Some progress has been made, but women remain   ""grossly   underrepresented"" in elective office worldwide, says Geraldine   Ferraro, U.S.   ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.      For that reason, she added in a May 9 speech to the   Africa-wide ""Consultation   for Women in Politics,"" held in Gaborone, Botswana, every time a   woman   candidate runs for office, women win worldwide.      Ferraro, a former U.S. Democratic Party vice presidential   nominee, cited a   book written in 1974 by former U.S. Ambassador to the United   Nations Jeane   Kirkpatrick.  She said the book, entitled ""Political Woman,"" could   serve as a   benchmark that can be used to chart the political progress of women   in the   United States.      Quoting Kirkpatrick, Ferraro said, ""'Half a century after the   ratification of   the 19th amendment -- which granted women the right to vote -- no   woman has   been nominated to be president or vice president.  No woman has   served on the   Supreme Court.'""      At that time, Ferraro explained, ""there was no woman in the   Cabinet, no woman   in the United States Senate, no woman serving as governor of a   major state, no   woman mayor of a major city, no woman in the top leadership of   either party.""      ""To be sure, in the 20 years since then, we have made some   progress,"" Ferraro   noted.      ""Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor sits on the Supreme   Court, along with   Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Women have been represented in every Cabinet   since   President Nixon's, and President Clinton has put a significant   number of women   into some of the most powerful Cabinet positions ever.  A woman is   currently   attorney general, budget director, economic adviser, as well as   secretary of   health and human services, head of the Department of Energy,   administrator of   the Environmental Protection Agency, and, of course, U.S.   ambassador to the   United Nations.      ""Eight women now serve in the United States Senate, four times   the number in   1992,"" she stressed.  ""There are currently 47 women serving in the   Congress, a   number that has tripled since 1984, and though we have only one   woman governor,   who's Republican, I think, she's rather impressive and could   possibly be the   next woman in the vice presidential spot on a national ticket.""      How did these women ascend to these positions of power and   importance?   Ferraro rhetorically asked her audience.  Not because they were   women but   because through hard work, they ""built a record of   achievement...distinction...and leadership.""      American women are making their presence known in local   politics as well, she   added.  ""In 1974, only 4 percent of the mayors and members of the   city council   were women.  Today, 20.9 percent are women, and though my hometown   of New York   City has yet to elect a woman as mayor, Carol Bellamy, who now   heads UNICEF   :United Nations Children's Fund:, ran for mayor in 1985, and Ruth   Messenger, a   local public official, is gearing up for the mayoral election in   1997.""      Putting the numbers in context, Ferraro said:  ""Women now hold   84 of the top   statewide elective offices in the country, which comes out to only   25.9   percent.  Although women have climbed onto the lower rungs of the   leadership   ladders in both parties in the House of Representatives, in the top   jobs --   speaker, majority or minority leader, majority and minority whip --   there are   still no women.""      What is most important, Ferraro stressed, is that women put   themselves in the   position to ""make that run"" for high public office.  ""Every time a   woman runs   for an elective office, it's like throwing a stone in a lake: the   ripples   spread far beyond the immediate point of impact.      ""In the lake of U.S. politics, the presidency is no mere   stone, it's a   boulder.  When a woman finally does run for that office, the ripple   effects   will create a wave of change that will be felt everywhere.""      Are political races that are lost worth the run? Ferraro   asked. ""Absolutely,""   she answered.  ""They are just as important -- for every time a   woman runs,   women win.  A greater number of women running means a greater   opportunity for   eventual success in making the process fairer.  A greater number of   women   attaining public office means a greater opportunity for eventual   success in   making the policies of a country fairer.""      Ferraro echoed the call that ""women's voices are essential to   good   government...not necessarily because we are more caring or more   effective, but   because we bring another dimension to the political process.      ""Instead of engaging in confrontation, women are more apt to   negotiate.   Instead of looking at short-term solutions to problems, women are   more apt to   think in terms of generations to come.  Instead of thinking in   win-lose terms,   women are more apt to see the gray area in between.""      The first-ever Africa-wide ""Consultation for Women in   Politics"" was   co-sponsored by Emang Basadi of Botswana, the African-American   Institute (AAI),   the United Nations Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and Women in Law and   Development in   Africa (WILDAF).  Funding was provided by the U.S. Agency for   International   Development (USAID) and UNIFEM.      The event attracted 70 women in politics from 27 African   nations, the United   States, and Norway.

GX119-46-1886770	"Text     only of letters sent from   the Committee on     Energy and Commerce Democrats.             May 22, 2001          Mr. David S. Addington  Counsel to the Vice President  Office of the Vice President  Old Executive Office Building  Washington, D.C. 20501    Dear Mr. Addington:    We are in receipt of a copy of your letter to Anthony Gamboa, General Counsel of the General Accounting Office (GAO) dated May 16, 2001. As you are aware, the GAO has accepted our request for a review of the President’s Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG). The details of that request were provided to you and to Andrew Lundquist, Executive Director of the NEPDG.    We are dismayed by your lack of full cooperation with GAO. Indeed, we are astounded by your questioning the authority of GAO to conduct an investigation. As you are aware, the ability of Congress to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch activities has been long established, and includes the ability to examine all deliberations. The GAO acts as the investigative arm of the Congress. Certainly the Vice President, who served as Secretary of Defense, must be aware of the role of GAO in the investigation of Executive Branch deliberations. You certainly must be aware of investigations of the Clinton Administration, such as the Travel Office, in which members of the President’s senior staff were interviewed by GAO.     In your letter, you state, ""It appears that the GAO may intend to intrude into the heart of Executive deliberations, including deliberations among the President, the Vice President, members of the President’s Cabinet, and the President’s immediate assistants, which the law protects to ensure the candor in Executive deliberations necessary to effective government."" We are not aware of any such law which is applicable to Congressional investigations. Perhaps you are referring to Executive Privilege. As you are aware, in some limited circumstances involving direct communications with the President, the President has invoked Executive Privilege. Since by precedent, this privilege can only be invoked by the President himself, we do not interpret your letter as invoking Executive Privilege. If that is your purpose, we wish to receive such clarification from the President directly.    As matters stand now, we have written to Mr. Lundquist on April 19, 2001. This was followed by a nonresponsive reply in the form of a letter from you to Chairmen Tauzin and Burton, with an attachment from Mr. Lundquist, on May 4, 2001. This was followed by a subsequent letter to Mr. Lundquist on May 15, 2001, renewing our requests contained in the April 19, 2001, letter. We have received no further reply.    It is a shame that the Vice President’s Energy Task Force has begun deliberations on the National Energy Policy with such a determined attitude of secrecy and stonewalling. We in Congress, and the public at large, have the right to know how the energy policy was developed, including what special interests were consulted, what influence they had, and how competing interests were reconciled.    We call on you to immediately provide full cooperation to the GAO investigation.    Sincerely,        JOHN D. DINGELL  RANKING MEMBER  COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE      HENRY A.

The documents also describe falsified power-delivery schedules, the submission of false information to the state, and the effective increasing of costs to all market participants by knowingly increasing the congestion costs,""  the letter stated.    “There is a huge amount of evidence pointing to illegal business practices by Enron and other companies that cheated Californians out of billions of dollars. The time has come to provide some answers.” said Representative George Miller, Ranking Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee. “Since last summer, when families were overcharged as much as $9 billion dollars for power, the California Delegation has been calling for a full investigation into whether Enron manipulated California’s energy market.”    Coined “Death Star” and “Get Shorty,” the internal Enron memos describe plans for elaborate schemes to deliberately manipulate California’s energy market and force consumers to pay exorbitant energy prices. Federal regulators released these documents Monday.    “Enron has proved to be the “death star” - the evil empire that worked up devious plans to defraud California energy consumers last summer, rob thousands of employees of their retirement nest-eggs this year, and spent millions on lobbyists to gain access to this Administration,” said Representative Miller.    Miller and 23 other members of the California Delegation are still waiting for a response to a similar request they made for a full investigation in February to the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “I cannot imagine why the leadership of the Committee has been completely unresponsive to our concerns that energy giants are cheating our constituents,” said Miller.    ###      Return to Miller Home Page           2205 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515   Phone: (202) 225-2095   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT:  Daniel Weiss                                          Privacy and Security Policy       This site is maintained by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Democratic Staff    For technical questions or comments about this Web site e-mail the  Webmaster"

Yet, when Americans pick up their morning newspapers and read about the stalling tactics of the Clinton Administration, they may be reminded of a somewhat different maxim:    ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""     The Clinton White House is refusing to comply with the evidentiary rules that apply to everyone else.  It refuses to turn over information that has been subpoenaed in criminal investigations, and it pleads with the courts for special treatment.  The courts, however,  have not been sympathetic.   The White House has lost every one of its cases:         The Clinton Administration lost the Hillary Clinton case in April 1997 (part of the Whitewater investigation - it also dealt with records from the late Vince Foster's office and records from Mrs. Clinton's former law firm that miraculously appeared in the residence area of the White House).       It lost the Mike Espy case in June 1997  (part of an investigation by Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz into whether former Secretary of Agriculture Espy illegally accepted gifts).        It lost the Secret Service case in May 1998 and again in July  (reportedly part of the investigation into whether any person lied under oath or encouraged another to do so in the Monica Lewinsky matter).       And, it lost the Bruce Lindsay/Sidney Blumenthal case in May 1998  (also reported to be related to the Lewinsky matter).       In denying the pleas of the White House, the courts have issued learned opinions.  However, many powerful arguments appear in other places.  We quote below from two United States Senators, an academic, and the exceptional James Madison.   When the White House pleads for special privileges, it puts itself in opposition to the law and to the kinds of moral, political, jurisprudential, and philosophical views that these gentlemen have expressed.         Senator Ted Kennedy said:      ...Government secrecy breeds Government deceit,...executive privilege nurtures executive arrogance,... national security is frequently the cover for political embarrassment, and...the best antidote to official malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance is the sunshine and fresh air of full public disclosure of official activities...  If [high officials in the government] don't think their activities can withstand public and congressional scrutiny, then maybe there is something wrong with the activities, not the scrutiny.""

(the Senator was speaking, not surprisingly, of Watergate, not Whitewater).]        James Madison said:    A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both.  Knowledge will forever govern ignorance:  And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives."" [Source:  Letter of James Madison to W.T. Barry (Aug. 4, 1822), in Gaillard Hunt (ed.), 9 JAMES MADISON'S WRITINGS 103 (1910) (Mr. Madison was writing on the subject of education).]         Scholar David Frohnmayer said:    A legislative body deprived of information in the conduct of public affairs is impotent to act in the national interest.  The judicial process becomes a mockery unless it has the capacity to determine the truth in controversies between parties.  Any legal doctrine that denies information to legislatures or courts threatens the essence and independence of these institutions and must therefore be justified, if it can be justified at all, only by the most compelling considerations of law and policy.  The stakes in the long-standing debate on...executive privilege could not be higher.""  [Source:  David B. Frohnmayer, ""An Essay on Executive Privilege"" in  Essays on Executive Privilege  1 (1974) (a pamphlet of the American Bar Foundation).]       Senator Sam Ervin said:    [E]xecutive privilege permits the President to keep secret confidential communications between him and his aides and even confidential communications among his aides which are had for the purpose of aiding the President to perform in a lawful manner his official duties. Further than this, executive privilege does not go.  Since the official duties of the President as defined by the Constitution and the laws do not encompass illegal or unethical or political activities, executive privilege does not confer upon the President the arbitrary power to withhold information, papers, or taped recordings, which are relevant to alleged crimes being investigated by a grand jury or undergoing trial before court, or which are relevant to illegal, unethical, or political activities being investigated by an authorized congressional committee.""

GX234-93-6407183	"TESTIMONY OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY INTERNATIONAL Given by: Thomas L. Jones Habitat for Humanity International United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs June 12, 2003 Thank you, Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes and members of the Committee for this opportunity to discuss expanding affordable homeownership in our country. I am Tom Jones, Vice President of Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI) and Managing Director of its Washington Office for the past eleven years. The Washington Office is a branch of the executive offices of Habitat for Humanity International, located in Americus, Georgia. The Washington Office serves as Habitat for Humanity International's presence in the nation's capital. We are privileged to represent Habitat for Humanity International with Congress and Administration, professional and industry groups, NGO's, international groups, embassies, other non-profits, labor unions, business corporations, and others. On behalf of Habitat for Humanity International, I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to testify before the Committee. The Members of this Committee continue to demonstrate their commitment to expanding housing opportunities for all persons by passing meaningful legislation and by holding hearings, such as this one--during  1   National Homeownership Month--to highlight affordable homeownership as one of the single most important tools that a family can use to improve their quality of life and build wealth. Just last week, Habitat for Humanity was honored to be joined by Secretary Martinez and many of you and your colleagues to kick-off National Homeownership Month by announcing our new, national initiative designed to offer members of Congress an opportunity to have hands-on experiences with families around the country seeking to build their dreams through the ""self-help"" model of homeownership. The ""Congress Building America"" program is a partnership between Habitat for Humanity, HUD, the U.S. Congress, and national corporate and nonprofit sponsors who will join forces with local Habitat affiliates to construct hundreds of affordable single-family homes. This initiative--modeled on the highly successful ""The Houses That Congress Built"" and ""The Houses The Senate Built"" in which many of you recently participated--is supported by congressional resolutions, already passed in the Senate and soon to be passed by the House. These resolutions express the sense of Congress in support of ""Congress Building America"" and increased access to affordable homeownership opportunities. Members of Congress are encouraged to participate in ""Congress Building America"" events with Habitat homeowner families and local Habitat affiliates in their districts or states during the 108th and the 109thsessions of Congress. We are confident that this partnership with Congress will strengthen the network of housing supporters, place the issue of affordable housing at the forefront of the nation's social  2   agenda, highlight the importance of volunteerism, and raise public awareness that access to affordable, decent and safe housing is an opportunity every person and family should have. Habitat for Humanity has spent the past twenty-seven years building affordable homes for homeownership with families who cannot qualify for mortgages in the conventional market. Home construction is supported by private donations, government partnerships for seed monies for land and infrastructure development, volunteer labor and homeowner's ""sweat equity."" Habitat homes are sold for no-profit and financed by zero-interest, long-term mortgages that each family can afford. The average Habitat house selling price in the U.S. was $51,219 in 2002. We have now built nearly 150,000 homes worldwide, and are working to complete another 50,000 homes by 2005, using 1,671 affiliates in all fifty states and over 500 international affiliates in 87 countries worldwide. Our homeowner families are typically first-time homebuyers who earn wages below 50 percent of the area median. Just over 71% of Habitat homeowners are minority and almost half are single parents raising school-aged children. Homeowners contribute 250--500 hours of their own labor as ""sweat-equity"" in the building of their house and other Habitat homes. By partnering with Habitat, families are able to move from substandard, deteriorating, overcrowded, and unsafe housing, sometimes even homelessness, into their very own homes which they purchase with an affordable mortgage and build with their own hands.  3   The success of Habitat for Humanity in creating homeownership opportunities for thousands of Americans who would otherwise never have the chance to own their own home is, in part, due to the generous support of Congress and the Administration. Since 1996, Congress has appropriated funding for the Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, part of the Section 4 Capacity Building funds that benefit other housing and community development organizations, and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, commonly known as SHOP. CAPACITY BUILDING FOR COMMUNITY-BASED HOUSING GROUPS Capacity Building assistance is the key to increasing the organizational strength of community-based nonprofits. The Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, as part of Section 4 funds which benefit the notable groups of LISC and the Enterprise Foundation, enables Habitat affiliates to improve communities on an even more significant scale by jumpstarting house production. Habitat affiliates essentially operate as local Community Development Corporations, with their own locally elected board and individual 501-c-3 nonprofit statuses. Many affiliates have no paid staff and must rely on the good will and hard work of volunteers. Thus the challenge for Habitat for Humanity is to provide affiliates with technical assistance, training, information, and access to new technology. The Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, in its sixth year of funding, increases the capacity of our affiliates to leverage outside funding sources, assists in the development and implementation of comprehensive training, brings  4   technical assistance closer to affiliates, and creates new, innovative programs. More specifically, our Capacity Building funds have been used to:  Provide local volunteers with the skills, training, and knowledge for developing resources through fundraising and securing gifts-in-kind from the private sector-- including faith-based organizations, businesses, foundations, civic clubs, labor unions, individuals, and others;  Foster new local, regional, and state official partnerships with organizations and groups such as college and university campus chapters, faith-based groups, civic clubs, prisons, professional groups, including realtors, bankers, home builders, local government, and labor unions to enhance the productivity of local affiliates;  Recruit and train local volunteers in communication skills and in ways to use media opportunities to raise public awareness to eliminate substandard housing and to provide opportunities for every American to achieve the dream of homeownership;  Recruit and provide development opportunities to persons for local board membership who have the leadership skills and the diversity needed to pursue the mission of increasing affordable homeownership at the local level;  Provide funding on a diminishing basis for affiliates to hire first time staff or staff for new positions that contribute to the affiliate's growth, so that more people are working at the local level to make housing happen;  5     Provide training opportunities via electronic, web-based communication targeted at securing resources, understanding new methods of construction, discovering sources for training and technical advancement, etc;    Focus efforts on the special housing needs and challenges in rural areas, Native American Indian communities, the Colonias, and other populations traditionally underserved by current housing programs and resources.  Within the context of regulations established for Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity funds, HFHI also conducts training and development of affiliates at the local level, working with groups of 30-40 affiliates through its affiliate support system; at the state level in all fifty states; through its seven regional offices; and nationally. The program includes conferences, training events, specialized technical assistance instruction, and provision of leadership at every possible level. Because many Habitat affiliates are located in rural locations, a major focus is on the unique rural needs for training and technical assistance. Likewise, special focus is made on training and assistance for crucial urban areas where housing needs are so great and which present unique challenges, calling for specialized training and technical assistance. The success of the Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program is measured by the increase in numbers of families housed. In the first two rounds of the Capacity Building grant program, 118 Habitat affiliates built 3,336 homes over the course of the three-year grants--52% more houses than they built in the three years  6   prior to receiving the grant. In addition, affiliates must match every Capacity Building dollar with three dollars of private, non-governmental funds and increase their building capacity by a minimum of 15%. This requirement has also been far surpassed. It is our hope that Congress will appropriate $15 million for the Capacity Building for Habitat for Humanity program, as it is crucial to increasing the building efforts of our local affiliates. SELF-HELP HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM (SHOP) The Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) was created by Congress in 1996 for the purpose of alleviating one of the largest obstacles faced by self-help housing developers in the production of affordable housing--the high cost of acquiring land and developing infrastructure before house construction even begins. SHOP funds are used exclusively for this purpose and have proven to be instrumental in jumpstarting affordable home building programs among self-help housing developers. The success and impact of the SHOP program is measured by numbers of homes produced: with the inclusion of the FY02 awards, SHOP funds will result in more than 9,000 new Habitat homes, changing the lives of over 34,000 Americans. This is an extraordinary accomplishment when one consider that for every $10,000 SHOP grant, on average, one home must be constructed, requiring additional resources of 4 to 10 times the amount of the initial investment to be raised in the private sector. HUD's SHOP grants are competitively awarded based upon an organization's experience in managing a sweat-equity program, a grantee's community needs, the capacity to generate other sources of funding and the soundness of its program design.  7   Groups compete annually for SHOP funds, designated solely for expenses related to acquiring and developing land for building homes that sell at costs below the prevailing market rates. SHOP funds can be used for land and infrastructure expenses such as streets, utilities, water and sewer connections, and for environmental clean up. SHOP families invest 300+ hours in sweat equity--although some families invest hundreds of additional hours--and must earn below 80% of the area median income. SHOP funds have been used to support the work of self-help housing organizations in every state, resulting in the development of thousands of affordable homes. The labor of volunteers and partner families, efficient building methods, modest house sizes and a zero or low-interest loan makes it affordable for low-income families to purchase a home of their own. The SHOP program is an important element of the Administration's national homeownership strategy, as it not only expands the ranks of low-income and minority homeowners, it requires the personal contribution of its recipients, increases volunteerism and community participation, and efficiently utilizes federal dollars by requiring the amount of the initial investment to be significantly leveraged. Habitat for Humanity, along with the other large user of SHOP funds--the Housing Assistance Council--believes that SHOP will be even more effective if the amount of the average award per house is increased from $10,000 to $15,000 to more accurately reflect the costs of land and infrastructure development. Nationally, the combined average of land and infrastructure expenses exceeds $21,000 for homes  8   build by both Habitat for Humanity and the Housing Assistance Council. This amount must be raised by affiliates before house construction can even begin. Both of our organizations strongly believe this change will make SHOP even more competitive and attractive to affiliates and other self-help housing groups, who will work even harder to find the additional private resources necessary to pursue their building programs. SINGLE-FAMILY HOMEOWNERSHIP TAX CREDIT Habitat for Humanity International also strongly supports the Administration's proposal to increase homeownership and affordable housing production through a single-family homeownership tax credit, modeled after the highly successful Low Income Housing Tax Credit. The proposed credit of up to 50 percent for the costs of constructing new homes for homeownership or rehabilitating existing properties for families in low-income urban and rural neighborhoods will enable our local affiliates and other housing developers to bridge the gap between the cost of developing affordable housing and the price that low-income homebuyers can pay for a home. The proposed homeownership tax credit legislation will create incentives for affordable housing development and infuse new resources into areas where the costs of construction and rehabilitation places homes beyond the reach of low and moderateincome families. The current legislative proposals in Congress are structured to generate the resources sufficient to cover the gap between the cost of development and the price at which a home can be sold to an eligible buyer, resulting in the construction  9   of more affordable housing and the strengthening of families and the communities in which they live. Habitat for Humanity International specifically supports two tax credit bills, S. 875 and H.R. 839, as both provide for a ten percent set-aside for qualified nonprofits. This provision, also included in last year's H.R.5052 and S.3126, will help ensure that nonprofits, like HFHI and other community and faith-based organizations, will be competitive applicants during the credit allocation process. A nonprofit set-aside--as successfully demonstrated in the current rental credit and HOME programs--has empowered nonprofit builders, often with fewer resources and serving lower income families, to be competitive for tax credits with their for-profit counterparts. Modest setasides are established elements in the country's strongest housing programs for lowincome families and encourage a ""level playing field"" for nonprofits. This is especially important for many other faith-based and community organizations who are often deeply rooted in communities and are particularly committed to providing housing for people with special needs--including the homeless, elderly and disabled. Many of these groups have proven track records of successful housing development in blighted urban and rural areas, often seen as unprofitable ventures for the for-profit sector. In fact, faith-based and community organizations are sometimes the only providers of affordable housing in such areas. A ten percent setaside will help ensure that the contributions of faith-based and community organizations in affordable housing production and related supportive services will continue to  10   enhance the federal government's commitment to provide adequate housing for its citizens. In conclusion, Habitat for Humanity believes that now more than ever, during this period in our country when homeownership rates are the highest in history, that the government should invest its resources in those segments of our population that have been left behind and left out of the financial mainstream. This country has the resources to adequately house the millions of Americans living in overcrowded, substandard and unaffordable conditions, but no one organization by itself can eradicate substandard housing. The solution lies in collaboration, with all sectors of society working together, including faith-based and community organizations. I would encourage Congress to strengthen its resolve to protect the least among us and preserve funding for affordable rental and homeownership opportunities, education, healthcare and other social services at precisely the time when it's needed most. Healthy neighborhoods require HUD's investment in quality housing--rental and homeownership. Failure to maintain a range of affordable housing options will create obstacles for families seeking to become homeowners in the future. As you review the funding proposals for FY04 and other related housing legislation, it our hope that you would support additional resources to enable low-income families to move from often overpriced, inadequate rental housing into affordable homeownership and continue your support of organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity, that help make the dream of affordable homeownership a reality for thousands of families each year.  11   12"
GX046-74-4384998	September 24, 2002            Senators Call on Conferees to        Include Strong Consumer Protections in Electricity Title         Daschle, Five Energy        Conferees sign Cantwell letter         WASHINGTON, DC  U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell        (D-WA) today announced that she was joined by 34 Senators, including        Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) and five energy bill conferees, Senator        Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Senator John Kerry (D-MA), Senator Harry Reid (D-NV),        Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), in sending        a letter to Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and ranking        member Frank Murkowski (R-AK), calling for enhanced consumer protections        in the electricity title of the energy bill currently in conference.            This letter sends a clear message that more        than a third of the Senate has serious concerns about the electricity        title in the energy bill, Cantwell said.    Since the        Senate passed this legislation, much more compelling evidence has surfaced        about the manner in which Enron and others were allowed to manipulate        energy markets to the detriment of the consumers and economy of the West.        Now is the time to improve not roll back the protections afforded our        nations electricity consumers. Unfortunately, the Senate electricity        title must be significantly improved to meet this goal, and the House        title offered last week is an even bigger leap backward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Im afraid that both versions give the        Federal Energy Regulatory Commission more authority to pursue deregulation        plans that have already cost western ratepayers billions of dollars, and        threaten chaos in our nations energy markets as a whole, Cantwell        said.    If energy bill conferees cannot come        to an agreement on language that appropriately responds to the western        energy crisis and the collapse of Enron by ensuring effective regulatory        oversight to prevent, detect and remedy market manipulation  in a manner        sensitive to regional differences  then they should not include an        electricity title in any final energy legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text of the letter and a list of the signers        follows:         September 24, 2002         The Honorable Jeff Bingaman, Chairman The        Honorable Frank Murkowski, Ranking Member Senate Committee on        Energy US Senate Washington, D.C. 20510         Dear Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member        Murkowski,         As you proceed with        efforts to craft final energy policy legislation, we urge you to consider        the reports of electricity market abuse and corporate malfeasance that        have come to light since the passage of S. 517, the Senate energy bill. In        light of recent events, we believe it is necessary that Congress take        additional steps to restore confidence in the energy industry and protect        electricity consumers from market manipulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         During consideration of        S. 517, the Senate debated measures necessary to oversee wholesale        electricity markets, prevent market manipulation and ensure that rates are        just and reasonableparticularly given the Western energy crisis and        collapse of Enron. Since passage of S. 517, however, consumer and investor        confidence in the utility industry has reached an all-time low.        Revelations of unethical and sometimes illegal activities within the        energy sector have further demonstrated the absence of adequate market        structures and oversight to prevent these activities from reoccurring:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Enron (and others) employed numerous trading schemes to        artificially restrict power supply and raise prices in the West.    These manipulative practices came        to light  only   because Enrons lawyers released key        documents during an investigation requested by Congress--not through any        independent discovery by federal or state regulators.                          Numerous energy marketers engaged in wash tradespower        sales designed only to boost perceived trading volume and, potentially,        inflate market prices.    The        pervasiveness of this scheme, as well as other manipulation strategies,        remains under investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission        (FERC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).                             Market manipulation is not limited to Enron or the        West:    allegations of abuse        abound throughout the country, even in the much-heralded PJM market.    As recently noted by the head of        the PJM market monitoring unit:           I dont think any energy market is        immune to manipulation.                                              The GAO assessed the capabilities of FERC and determined        that the Commission is not performing the market oversight needed to        ensure just and reasonable rates.                          Allegations of abuse and rating agency downgrades have        shaken investor confidence, with one analyst quoted in Business Week        stating that theres overall investor disgust with this sector now.     As a        result, it is more difficult for energy companies to attract the capital        required to build needed infrastructure. It also makes further contraction         and less competition--within the utility industry more likely.                                                                                                                     We need to advance a regulatory and market        structure that promotes ethical business practices, ensures fair        competition, provides effective market oversight and aggressively        prosecutes those who seek to circumvent the rules.    Regrettably, electricity        provisions pending in conference fail to provide the necessary framework        and safeguards.            Congress must ensure that:                                  Market rates can be charged for utility services only when        truly competitive marketsthose that bear just and reasonable        rates--exist;                          All energy transactions are subject to effective regulatory        oversight to detect, prevent and correct market manipulation and abuse;                          Energy companies are held to the highest business standards         and companies and their executives are penalized if they violate the        public trust;                           Market transparency and early-warning systems are        established to make sure allegations of market abuse are known and        corrected.                                                                         As the Western energy        crisis and Enrons collapse made clearand as recent revelations have        reinforced the market is ripe for manipulation unless clear safeguards        are put in place and companies are held accountable. Consumers and        investors alike must be reassured of our energy markets integrity.    It is our hope that this ethic will be adequately reflected in any        electricity legislation the Conference Committee reports back to the        Senate.

GX253-93-1559161	"PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ON CROSS-BORDER FRAUD _____________ Before the SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, TRADE, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION of the HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE Washington, D.C. September 17, 2003 ________________   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to appear before the Subcommittee today to provide information on the challenge of cross-border fraud and the efforts of the Federal Trade Commission (""Commission"" or ""FTC"") to address this growing problem.1 The FTC is the federal government's principal consumer protection agency, with a mandate to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices and to maintain vigorous competition in the marketplace.2 The Federal Trade Commission Act authorizes the Commission to file federal district court actions, which typically seek preliminary and permanent injunctions to halt deceptive activity and seek to provide redress for injured consumers.3 An increasing number of these actions involve cross-border fraud and deception, which adversely affect American consumers and businesses. These actions often involve foreign businesses and individuals, consumers, assets, or evidence. Similarly, an increasing number of consumer complaints collected in our Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the Commission involve either domestic consumers complaining about foreign businesses or foreign consumers complaining about domestic businesses.4 Thus, we are devoting additional resources to fighting cross-border fraud within the existing legislative framework and are proposing certain legislative changes that would give us additional tools to help address the problem of crossborder fraud. Most of our proposed changes are based on authority Congress has already given to securities, antitrust, and banking enforcers in the international context. Today's testimony begins by describing the growth of cross-border fraud and the problems associated with this growth. It then discusses our efforts within the existing legislative framework to combat cross-border fraud. Finally, it examines the need for additional legislation to help us fight cross-border fraud and describes our legislative recommendations. I. The Problem of Cross-Border Fraud  Today, cross-border fraud operators are victimizing American consumers to an extent unknown just a few years ago, and the problem is growing worse. Globalization of trade, The written statement represents the views of the Federal Trade Commission. My oral presentation and responses are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or of any other Commissioner. 2 1  15 U.S.C.  45(a).  See 15 U.S.C.  53(b). The FTC also is authorized to initiate administrative proceedings to enforce the Federal Trade Commission Act. See 15 U.S.C.  45(b). Consumer Sentinel is a database of consumer fraud complaints maintained by the FTC. Complaints are entered into the database from many sources and are accessible to more than 700 law enforcement agencies in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The database currently contains over one million complaints. See www.consumer.gov/sentinel. 1 4  3   improvements in the international telephone system, and the advent of the Internet have given consumers direct access to foreign sellers. Today, there are satellite networks broadcasting advertisements around the world, with operators waiting to take orders in many languages. Telemarketers routinely call U.S. consumers from Canada. Most significantly, electronic commerce in many instances is blurring the effect of national borders. Cross-border commerce creates new opportunities for consumers and businesses, but it also poses new challenges to consumer confidence and to law enforcement. Consumers cannot assess the credibility of many merchants located across the globe as easily as they could with local vendors, and law enforcement cannot protect consumers as easily from fraud operators who, effectively, may be out of reach. Using Internet and long-distance telephone technology, fraud operators can strike quickly on a global scale, victimize thousands of consumers in a short time, and disappear nearly without a trace  along with their ill-gotten gains. For example, fraudulent Canadian telemarketers victimize American consumers and hide their ill-gotten gains in foreign bank accounts. Website operators victimize consumers worldwide and take down their sites when they learn they are being investigated by law enforcement. And deceptive spammers can easily hide their identity, forge the electronic path of their email messages, and send messages from anywhere in the world to anyone in the world. A. Complaint Statistics  Not surprisingly, an increasing number of complaints collected in Consumer Sentinel involve international transactions. In 2002, 14 percent of the complaints collected in Consumer Sentinel involved either domestic consumers complaining about foreign businesses or foreign consumers complaining about domestic businesses, as compared with less than 1 percent in 1995.5 Seventy-nine percent of these complaints in 2002 involved U.S. consumers complaining about foreign businesses.6 The complaints include more than 24,000 complaints by U.S. consumers against foreign companies, complaining about transactions involving more than $72 million.7 The cross-border fraud schemes U.S. consumers complained about most often in 2002 involved foreign money offers, advance fee loans, prizes, sweepstakes gifts, and internet auctions.8 The obstacles we face in fighting cross-border fraud leave U.S. consumers particularly vulnerable to such scams.

FTC Cross-Border Cases  In the past several years, there has been a corresponding increase in FTC cases with a cross-border component. These cases often target foreign defendants. The FTC has brought cases against defendants in Australia,9 Canada,10 Hong Kong,11 Spain,12 Switzerland,13 and the United Kingdom.14 Many of the cases have involved the transfer of assets to such offshore locations as the Bahamas,15 the Cayman Islands,16 the Cook Islands,17 and Vanuatu.18 The cases also frequently involve evidence located in other countries, including Canada, the Netherlands, FTC v.

Problems Faced by Law Enforcement  Despite the FTC's vigorous law enforcement activities, cross-border fraud operators continue to use national borders to facilitate their schemes. Those engaged in cross-border fraud enjoy more attractive revenue prospects and face a lower likelihood of prosecution than domestic scam artists because:  E.g., FTC v. Electronic Prods. Distrib., LLC, Civ. Action No. 02-CV-888H (AJB) S.D. Calif. filed May 7, 2002), available at  ; FTC v. Assail, Inc., Civ. A. No. W03CA007 (W.D. Tex. filed Jan. 9, 2003), available at  ; FTC v. 1492828 Ontario Inc., d/b/a First Capital Consumers Group, Civ. Action No. 02C 7456 (N.D. Ill. filed Oct. 17, 2002), available at  ; FTC v.

Action No. 01-CV-096 (N.D. Okla. filed May 30, 2001), available at  . To date, the FTC has brought over 56 enforcement actions involving deceptive or fraudulent spam. Prepared Statement of the Federal Trade Commission, Spam (Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail), Before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 108th Cong. (May 21, 2003). This conclusion is also supported by the FTC's recent initiative to educate businesses about ""open relays."" Open relays allow third parties to route their e-mail through servers of other organizations, thereby disguising the real origin of the e-mail. The FTC initiative, conducted in partnership with 16 other agencies in four countries, found that a significant portion of the open relays identified were located outside the United States, in countries such as China, Korea, Japan, Italy, Poland, Brazil, Germany, Taiwan, Mexico, Great Britain, Chile, France, Argentina, India, Spain, and Canada. 4 22 21 20  19   ! They can target a larger market. ! Evidence of their scams is often spread out in different jurisdictions, and it is difficult for the relevant authorities to share that evidence. Indeed, many U.S.-based defendants purposefully use foreign third parties to perpetrate their scams in an attempt to evade U.S. law enforcement authorities.23 ! It is sometimes unclear which countries have legal jurisdiction to act. 24  ! U.S. enforcers have extremely limited ability to impose conduct remedies on foreign defendants because most courts will not enforce injunctive orders issued in other countries.25 ! The fraud operators can move money offshore, thus necessitating a foreign action to enforce a U.S. court judgment. This is time-consuming, expensive, and, in many For example, in FTC v. Zuccarini, Civ. Action No. 01-CV-4854 (E.D. Pa. filed Sept. 25, 2001), available at  , the defendant had initially perpetrated his Internet scheme using U.S.-based Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and domain registrars. When he found out that the FTC was investigating him, he fled the country and continued to perpetrate his scheme through ISPs in the Netherlands and domain registrars in France, Germany, and Spain. The FTC recently faced this situation with respect to a matter that a foreign consumer protection agency referred to us concerning a scheme run by a U.S. company in various parts of Europe. Because of its enabling legislation, the referring agency could not bring an action against a U.S. company. Upon investigation, FTC staff learned that no U.S. consumers were injured by the scheme and neither the misrepresentations nor other conduct material to the fraud occurred in the United States. Given that the jurisdictional nexus to the U.S. was unclear in this case, as well as the practical problems that litigation would have posed, FTC staff decided not to pursue the case. By structuring its operations in this manner, the entity evaded law enforcement authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. FTC v. Verity International illustrates the limits of imposing conduct remedies on foreign defendants. 140 F. Supp. 2d 313, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). In that case, the individual foreign defendants failed to comply with the asset-reporting requirements of a preliminary injunction obtained by the FTC. The U.S. court held them in contempt. In arguing against the motion for contempt, defendants pointed out that the contempt order would be futile because they were unlikely to enter the United States while the contempt matter was outstanding. The court acknowledged that defendants could avoid arrest by staying outside of the United States, but granted the motion for contempt, suggesting that preventing the defendants from entering the United States was an appropriate measure in this case. This case illustrates the limits of a contempt order on foreign defendants  as a practical matter, a foreign defendant can generally avoid sanctions for contempt by staying outside the United States. 5 25 24 23   cases, futile, as many countries do not enforce U.S. court judgments obtained by government agencies.26  ! Enforcers have less incentive to pursue fraud operators who victimize consumers outside their jurisdictions but leave local consumers alone. The legislative recommendations that we make today will help to minimize some of these burdens, as further described below. In other cases, the burdens result from other countries' practices. We believe that our proposed legislation, if passed, will encourage greater reciprocity, providing an incentive for these countries to lift existing barriers to combating cross-border fraud. D. Importance of Pursuing Cross-Border Fraud Operators Pursuing those who victimize U.S. consumers from abroad is important to protect  This problem has arisen in many FTC-related cases. For example, a receiver appointed in an FTC matter recently faced difficulties in obtaining relief from an Australian court. In Evans v. Citibank Limited & others, Equity Division Proceedings No. 4999 of 1999 (Sup. Ct. New South Wales), the receiver was not seeking direct enforcement of an FTC judgment, but instead was attempting to use the FTC's judgment as a basis for ordering a thirdparty bank to transfer certain assets to the control of the receiver under a constructive trust theory. The court held that the receiver's claims were ""penal"" in nature and denied the receiver's claim. This matter is currently on appeal. Similarly, United States v. Asiatrust Limited, Plaint No. 57/1999, was a case challenging the defendants' transfer of funds to a Cook Islands trust to defeat the FTC's judgment in FTC v. Affordable Media, LLC, Civ. Action No. CV-S-98-669LDG (RLH) (D. Nev. filed Apr. 23, 1998). The High Court of the Cook Islands construed the case (which was pled as a new action) as one involving the enforcement of a penal law. The Cook Islands court dismissed the United States' action holding that the FTC's action was one to enforce ""regulatory rights and powers."" ""They are or have a flavour of punishment and I conclude that these are at least in part, penal provisions, and fall within the relevant principle. It is also a public law which is sought to be enforced by the state or the sovereign alone for regulatory purposes and is one which ought not be enforced here."" (4 Dec. 2001 Judgment at 8). The matter ultimately was resolved by settlement and the defendants repatriated their assets to the FTC pursuant to a stipulated judgment. See also Impediments to Digital Trade Before the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, 107th Cong. (2001) (statement of Jeff Kovar, Assistant Legal Advisor for Private International Law, Department of State) (""Most foreign judgments are already recognized and enforced in the U.S. under state law, but most of our trading partners do not usually grant the same treatment to U.S. judgments.""). 6  26   consumers from the substantial harm foreign fraud operators can cause.27 Moreover, consumers' concerns about fraud and deception in the global marketplace could undermine their confidence in cross-border transactions and could lead them to conclude that they should only do business with local merchants. Unaddressed, these consumer concerns could hurt legitimate businesses by shrinking the market for their products and services. If the promise of the global marketplace is to be fully realized, governments must assure consumers that they are working to keep markets free from fraud and deception. Pursuing U.S. businesses who victimize foreign consumers is also critical. Stopping U.S.-based cross-border fraud and deception will help protect legitimate U.S. businesses from dishonest competitors, as well as the reputation of the U.S. marketplace. Cooperation is also necessary to engender reciprocity: FTC action to protect foreign consumers from fraud and deception emanating from U.S. businesses increases the willingness of foreign governments to cooperate in protecting U.S. consumers from fraud operators in their countries. II. The FTC's Efforts to Fight Cross-Border Fraud and Deception  Despite the enforcement difficulties outlined above, the FTC has continued to fight crossborder fraud and deception within the existing legislative framework, through its enforcement and policymaking initiatives. On the enforcement front, in 2002, the FTC brought approximately 20 new federal district court lawsuits involving one or more foreign defendants or foreign consumers, and continued to litigate and settle dozens of other cases involving fraud and deception that operate across national borders. In the first quarter of 2003 alone, the FTC filed new cases involving advance-fee credit cards peddled by Canadian telemarketers,28 allegedly bogus international driving licenses advertised through spam email by defendants in Denmark29 and other foreign countries including Israel, the Bahamas, and Romania,30 and products and  Prepared Statement of the Federal Trade Commission, Cross-Border Fraud: Improving Transnational Law Enforcement Cooperation: Hearing Before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Government Affairs, 107th Cong.

Although we were successful in these cases, we encountered difficulties, as outlined above. In addition to its ongoing work on investigations and cases, in October 2002, FTC Chairman Timothy J. Muris unveiled a Five-Point Plan for Fighting Cross-Border Fraud.33 The Plan recognizes the importance of initiatives on both the international and domestic fronts and the need for action by both the public and private sectors. Highlights of the Plan follow: Developing an OECD Recommendation on Cross-Border Fraud: FTC Commissioner Mozelle Thompson has led the United States delegation to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Committee on Consumer Policy since 1998 and has chaired the Committee since 2002. Under his leadership, the OECD issued Guidelines for Protecting Consumers from Fraudulent and Deceptive Commercial Practices Across Borders in June 2003. The Guidelines recognize that combating fraud and deception is an important priority for government consumer protection agencies. They represent the consensus of 30 countries on the importance of international cooperation to combat fraudulent and deceptive commercial practices. The Guidelines also provide impetus for legislative and policy reform in OECD countries for combating such practices. Public-Private Partnerships to Combat Cross-Border Fraud: The FTC has issued a call to legitimate industry to help fight cross-border fraud, which hurts consumers as well as legitimate businesses. In many cases, domestic and foreign third parties, such as credit card issuers and networks, banks, and Internet service providers, can assist law enforcement by providing information about foreign fraud operators. Domestic third parties may be able to suspend domain names, telephone services, mailing services, or financial services to foreign fraud operators, who we may not be able to reach through court orders. Earlier this year, the FTC held a public workshop to explore these issues.34 We are continuing to work with the private sector to follow up on some of the ideas discussed at the workshop, including better sharing of information between the private sector and the FTC. Discussions at the workshop also highlighted obstacles to public-private sector cooperation to combat cross-border fraud, FTC v. Dr. Clark Research Ass'n, Civ. A. No. 1:03CV0054 (N.D. Ohio filed Jan. 8, 2003), available at  . FTC v. CSCT, Inc., Civ. Action No. 03 C 00880 (N.D. Ill. filed Feb. 6, 2003), available at  . See Timothy J.

Technical Assistance: The FTC wants to ensure that developing countries do not become havens for fraud. Therefore, we have conducted training missions on consumer protection issues in various developing countries, in cooperation with and funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Last year, we conducted training sessions for consumer protection authorities from 13 Eastern European countries. This year, we are conducting training sessions in Peru, Romania, and the Ukraine. Developing and strengthening bilateral and multilateral relationships: The FTC has undertaken several activities in this area:  "" The FTC has signed consumer protection cooperation agreements with Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, that have enhanced our cooperation with these countries.35 We are continuing to expand our law enforcement activities with these countries. "" In Canada, the Commission participates in two consumer protection enforcement task forces: Project Emptor with British Columbia authorities, and the Toronto Strategic Partnership with a wide variety of Canadian and U.S. authorities.36 In the past year, the FTC has announced numerous joint law enforcement actions taken with the assistance of these task forces, including actions involving credit card loss  See Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada Regarding the Application of their Competition and Deceptive Marketing Practices Laws, TRADE REG.

""  The FTC is a member of the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN), a group of consumer protection enforcement agencies from 32 countries that meets twice a year to discuss cases, investigation techniques, and other information. Seventeen ICPEN countries plus the OECD participate in econsumer.gov, a public website where consumers can file cross-border ecommerce complaints online, making them accessible to law enforcement agencies in the member countries. The site is available in English, French, Spanish, and German.41 Complaints from econsumer.gov can help the FTC identify trends and wrongdoers on an international level.  In addition, the Five-Point Plan recognizes that, although there are certain activities the FTC can undertake within our existing legislative framework, new legislation is necessary to help combat the problem of cross-border fraud effectively. The remainder of this testimony focuses on the Commission's legislative recommendations. III. Legislative Recommendations  Despite our successes, we face daunting challenges in the battle against cross-border fraud and deception. Many of these challenges reflect the shortcomings of a legal framework developed when consumer protection was almost purely a domestic concern. In the emerging global marketplace, that framework must be expanded to allow the FTC to act with effectiveness and dispatch to protect American consumers. In testimony to Congress during hearings on spam, the Commission also emphasized the need for improvements to the FTC's law enforcement  FTC v. STF Group, Civ. Action No. 03 C 0977 (N.D.

The OECD Guidelines discussed above specifically provide that ""[m]ember countries should review their own domestic frameworks to identify obstacles to effective cross-border co-operation in the enforcement of laws designed to protect consumers against fraudulent and deceptive commercial practices, and should consider changing domestic frameworks, including, if appropriate, through adopting or amending national legislation to overcome these barriers.""43 The FTC's legislative proposals would implement this provision. Even though new legislation would not solve all of the problems in fighting cross-border fraud, it could go far to reduce some of the obstacles we face. The FTC is proposing legislation in four areas:  !  First, the FTC is seeking to strengthen its ability to cooperate with its foreign counterparts, which are often investigating the same targets as the FTC.  We are currently prohibited by statute from sharing certain information we obtain in our investigations with our foreign counterparts. This prohibition can hurt U.S. consumers. For example, even if both the FTC and a Canadian consumer protection agency are investigating the same Canadian telemarketer that is defrauding U.S. consumers, in many cases, the FTC cannot share information it obtains pursuant to its main investigatory tool, the Civil Investigative Demand (CID), with the Canadian agency. This is true even though a Canadian action against the cross-border telemarketer would benefit U.S. consumers.44 Similarly, in one recent case, the FTC obtained an order against a spammer defrauding U.S. consumers and found that the spammer had an affiliate that was perpetrating the same scam from a foreign country, targeting both U.S. and foreign consumers. The FTC cannot share the information it obtained pursuant to a CID with its foreign counterpart. The changes we are seeking would allow us to share such information and provide investigative assistance to certain foreign agencies in appropriate cases.

OECD Guidelines for Protecting Consumers from Fraudulent and Deceptive Commercial Practices Across Borders C(2003)116 (June 11, 2003). The Commission cannot disclose ""documentary material, tangible things, reports or answers to questions and transcripts of oral testimony"" that are ""received by the Commission pursuant to compulsory process in an investigation"" without the consent of the person who submitted the information, except as specifically provided. 15 U.S.C.  57b-2(b)(3)(C); 16 C.F.R.  4.10(d). 11 44 43  42   !  Second, the FTC is seeking to improve its information-gathering capabilities.  The key to combating cross-border fraud successfully is the ability to sue without tipping off investigative targets. Once notified of FTC action, targets in these types of cases often disappear and move assets offshore, beyond the reach of U.S. courts. Thus, we are seeking to improve our ability to obtain more information from third parties without requiring advance notice to our investigative targets. Currently, we have no mechanism to require most third parties to keep CIDs confidential. Many third parties have told us that they will provide notice to the target before they will share information with us, sometimes because they believe notice may be required and sometimes even if such notice clearly is not required by law. Because of this concern, we often do not send the CIDs, thus losing a potential source of information in FTC investigations. We would like to be able to seek court orders requiring third parties to keep CIDs confidential for a finite period of time, which would improve our ability to gather information. This recommendation carefully balances law enforcement interests with privacy interests. In all cases in which we want a mandate that third parties keep CIDs confidential, we would be required to seek a court order, and the confidential treatment would be temporary. To further improve our ability to gather information, we also are seeking improvements in our ability to gather more information from federal financial regulators and foreign law enforcement agencies.  !  Third, the FTC is seeking to improve its ability to obtain consumer redress in crossborder cases by clarifying its authority to take action in such cases, and expanding its ability to use foreign counsel to pursue assets offshore.  One of the key elements of an effective anti-fraud program is depriving wrongdoers of their ill-gotten gains, reducing the incentives to engage in fraud. To the extent that money can be returned to consumers, it reduces their injury and increases their confidence in law enforcement. Among the changes the Commission is recommending is a provision clarifying that the Commission has the authority to take action in appropriate cross-border cases and provide restitution to both U.S. and foreign consumers injured by cross-border fraud and deception. By clarifying the availability of remedies, Congress can protect Americans from foreign fraud operators and prevent the United States from becoming a haven for fraud artists targeting victims abroad. It also can send a strong signal to foreign courts considering whether to enforce an FTC money judgment when there are foreign as well as U.S. victims. Moreover, the Commission increasingly is facing significant obstacles in obtaining the proceeds of fraud and deception from defendants who have assets abroad, beyond the reach of U.S. courts. The Commission therefore also seeks to target more resources toward foreign litigation to facilitate recovery of offshore assets to benefit defrauded U.S. consumers.  !  Finally, the FTC is seeking to strengthen its international cooperative relationships by obtaining authority to conduct staff exchanges and to provide financial support for certain joint projects. 12   The FTC participates in many international projects to combat cross-border fraud, including the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN), the MexicoU.S.-Canada Health Fraud Task Force (MUCH), Project Emptor with various British Columbia authorities, and the Strategic Partnership with various Ontario authorities. The FTC also consults with foreign counterparts at bilateral and multilateral meetings. Often, it would be helpful for the FTC to provide monetary assistance to support cooperative projects and meetings of such groups. Currently, various appropriations statutes prohibit the FTC from using appropriated funds to pay any expenses of a Commission, council, board or similar group that does not have a prior and specific statutory approval to receive financial support.45 The FTC's legislative proposals seek to overcome this restriction. *** Congress has already provided many of the tools that we seek to agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). For example, thirteen years ago, Congress expanded the SEC's powers to cooperate with foreign authorities.46 At the time, the SEC faced issues analogous to those faced by the FTC today regarding the growth of international fraud and deception in electronic commerce: The internationalization of the world's securities markets is a trend that is likely to continue at a rapid pace. The major forces driving this trend appear to be: rapid technological advances in communications and computer technology [and] the growing economic interdependence between the U.S. and its major trading partners . . .Therefore, securities regulators in each nation must work with their foreign counterparts to seek coordinated international solutions to assure fairer as well as more efficient market operations across borders.47 Since 1990, the SEC has been granted statutory authority to gather and share relevant information with its foreign counterparts. As a result of these statutory provisions, the SEC can offer significant benefits to those foreign authorities seeking reciprocal cross-border cooperation. Indeed, the SEC has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with over 30 foreign agencies. These MOUs significantly streamline cross-border cooperation and, in some cases,  See Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, Division J  Treasury and General Appropriations, Title VI,  610, 117 Stat. 11, 465 (codified at 31 U.S.C.  1345). 46  45  Securities Acts Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-550 (1990). H.R.

We have consulted on our recommendations with other federal government agencies, including the Department of Justice, Department of State, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the SEC and CFTC, as well as several private companies and public interest groups, including the National Consumers League, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Center for Democracy and Technology. We are working closely with these entities in fashioning the legislative provisions, both to meet their concerns and to achieve our objectives. The Commission greatly appreciates the opportunity to provide this information to the Subcommittee. We look forward to continuing to work with Congressional staff on our legislative proposals.
