GX161-37-9172902	WSR 02-05-089 PREPROPOSAL STATEMENT OF INQUIRY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE [ Filed February 20, 2002,  11:48 a.m. ] Subject of Possible Rule Making:  Rules relating to noxious weed seed and plant quarantine,  chapter 16-752 WAC . Statutes Authorizing the Agency to Adopt Rules on this Subject:  Chapters 17.24 and 17.10 RCW. Reasons Why Rules on this Subject may be Needed and What They Might Accomplish:  Kudzu,  Pueraria sp. , is an extremely invasive woody vine weed species that has caused sever economic and environmental problems in the southeastern region of the United States.  In August 2001, a small, rapidly growing infestation was discovered and eradicated in Clark County.  Amendment of the existing noxious weed seed and plant quarantine rule to add one or two kudzu species to the list of species forbidden from sale or distribution in the state was requested by the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board and the Washington State Weed Coordinators Association.  The quarantine is intended to aid in prevention of kudzu introduction and spread in this state. Other Federal and State Agencies that Regulate this Subject and the Process Coordinating the Rule with These Agencies:  USDA APHIS regulates a limited number of species under the federal noxious weed regulations.  However, the federal list is mainly intended to apply to international shipment, and the federal agency is not usually active in interstate or intrastate noxious weed regulation.  The state office of USDA APHIS will be notified.  The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board establishes the state noxious weed list under authority of  chapter 17.10 RCW .  It requested addition of kudzu species to WSDA quarantine rules to complement its own and the county noxious weed boards' efforts. Process for Developing New Rule:   The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board and the Washington State Weed Coordinators Association have requested the changes to this rule.  Representatives of the Washington State Department of Agriculture discuss specific provisions of the proposal with interested agencies and stakeholders such as the Nursery Advisory Board, and then publish the rule proposal.  Interested parties can participate in the decision to adopt the new rule and formulation of the proposed rule before publication by contacting Mary A.

It is the intent of the commission that the public be provided with all relevant information regarding a horse's recent racing and workout record; Therefore:  (1) (( A horse which during the past calendar year, has started in a race which is not reported in the daily racing form and/or equibase shall not be entered at a Washington track unless and until the owner or trainer shall have furnished to the racing secretary, at entry time, performance records as hereinafter designated.  Such performance records shall show where and when said horse raced; the distance; the weight carried; amount earned; said horse's finishing position and time. ))  The owner/and or trainer of any horse which has started at a track not reported in the daily racing form or equibase since its last start at a recognized track, must furnish the racing secretary prior to the entry of such horse to any race in this state, performance records of said horse's races during the past year, or their last two starts, including published races, showing date, distance, finishing position and time.  If such records are not provided, the horse will be ineligible to start. (2) (( In a maiden race, a horse which at any time, has started in a race which is not reported in the daily racing form and/or equibase shall not be entered at a Washington track unless and until the owner or trainer shall have furnished to the racing secretary at entry time, complete performance records as hereinafter designated.  Such performance records shall show where and when said horse raced; the distance; the weight carried; amount earned; said horse's finishing position and time. ))  For thoroughbreds, a horse which wins a race at a Class C track within the state, shall not be penalized for such winnings in races run at any other meeting other than a Class C track.  The maiden classification will be lost by winning a race at any track whose results are published in the daily racing form or equibase.  A horse which wins a race at a track with results not reported in the daily racing form or equibase, outside this state, shall not be penalized for such winnings except at Class C tracks.  For other breeds, all wins, including the maiden wins, shall be counted in considering eligibility at all racing association meets in the state of Washington if the win is recognized by the arabian jockey club, the American quarter horse association, the appaloosa horse club, or other breed registry as authorized by the commission. (3) Performance records for races which are not reported in the daily racing form and/or equibase shall be published in the official program of the racing association or posted and announced no later than the time that wagering opens for that day's racing.  No horse may be permitted to enter in a race whose recent workouts have not been properly recorded with the commission.

GX245-93-13482953	Minnesota Rules, Table of Chapters     Table of contents for Chapter 6800     6800.1210 INACTIVE STATUS AND EMERITUS LICENSE.         Subpart 1.   Inactive status.   A pharmacist currently   licensed in Minnesota who is not in active practice in Minnesota   may apply for an inactive status license with the board.    Requests for inactive status licensure shall be made at the time   of license renewal.        The board shall grant an inactive status license to a   pharmacist making the request on submission of a sworn statement   stating that the pharmacist is not in active practice in   Minnesota.        A pharmacist granted an inactive status license must   continue to pay the renewal fee for licensure but shall not be   required to comply with the continuing education requirements of   the board.  A pharmacist granted inactive status is not   authorized to practice pharmacy in Minnesota while on inactive   status.        If an individual's license is on inactive status and that   individual maintains an active status license in good standing   in another state that requires continuing education, the   individual may reactivate the Minnesota license by showing   compliance with the continuing education requirements of the   other state.  If an individual in this category has been on   inactive status in Minnesota for longer than five years, the   individual must also take and pass the jurisprudence examination   described in part  6800.1300 , subpart 5, offered to candidates   for licensure by reciprocity.        If an individual's license is on inactive status in   Minnesota and that individual is not licensed in another state   that requires continuing education and now seeks to reactivate   the license in Minnesota, the individual must show that   continuing pharmaceutical education has been completed at a rate   of 15 hours per year for each year that the license has been on   inactive status up to a maximum of 75 hours.  If the license has   been on inactive status for longer than five years, the   individual must also take and pass the jurisprudence examination   described in part  6800.1300 , subpart 5, offered to candidates   for licensure by reciprocity.        An individual whose license has lapsed before November 1,   1993, and who wishes to be relicensed must apply under Minnesota   Statutes, section  151.14 .        Subp. 2.   Emeritus.   A pharmacist who is completely retired   from active pharmacy practice may apply to the board for an   emeritus license providing the pharmacist has not been   disciplined by the board.  An emeritus license is not a license   to practice, but is a formal recognition of completion of that   individual's pharmacy career in good standing.        An emeritus pharmacist is not subject to renewal fees or   continuing education requirements.        A pharmacist interested in an emeritus license may obtain   an application form by requesting it on the annual renewal form   or by writing or calling the board office.

GX105-83-9031480	WSR 02-05-089 PREPROPOSAL STATEMENT OF INQUIRY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE [ Filed February 20, 2002,  11:48 a.m. ] Subject of Possible Rule Making:  Rules relating to noxious weed seed and plant quarantine,  chapter 16-752 WAC . Statutes Authorizing the Agency to Adopt Rules on this Subject:  Chapters 17.24 and 17.10 RCW. Reasons Why Rules on this Subject may be Needed and What They Might Accomplish:  Kudzu,  Pueraria sp. , is an extremely invasive woody vine weed species that has caused sever economic and environmental problems in the southeastern region of the United States.  In August 2001, a small, rapidly growing infestation was discovered and eradicated in Clark County.  Amendment of the existing noxious weed seed and plant quarantine rule to add one or two kudzu species to the list of species forbidden from sale or distribution in the state was requested by the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board and the Washington State Weed Coordinators Association.  The quarantine is intended to aid in prevention of kudzu introduction and spread in this state. Other Federal and State Agencies that Regulate this Subject and the Process Coordinating the Rule with These Agencies:  USDA APHIS regulates a limited number of species under the federal noxious weed regulations.  However, the federal list is mainly intended to apply to international shipment, and the federal agency is not usually active in interstate or intrastate noxious weed regulation.  The state office of USDA APHIS will be notified.  The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board establishes the state noxious weed list under authority of  chapter 17.10 RCW .  It requested addition of kudzu species to WSDA quarantine rules to complement its own and the county noxious weed boards' efforts. Process for Developing New Rule:   The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board and the Washington State Weed Coordinators Association have requested the changes to this rule.  Representatives of the Washington State Department of Agriculture discuss specific provisions of the proposal with interested agencies and stakeholders such as the Nursery Advisory Board, and then publish the rule proposal.  Interested parties can participate in the decision to adopt the new rule and formulation of the proposed rule before publication by contacting Mary A.

Those county boards and districts, in turn, direct the much-larger weed control efforts of property owners  Mission Statement Our mission is to serve as responsible stewards of Washington by protecting and preserving the land and resources from the degrading impacts of noxious weeds. We believe that prevention is the best approach and may be achieved through full implementation of the intent of the state noxious weed law. To further that, we strive for enhanced public awareness through improved educational efforts. As the Board, we do not deal directly in control activities but rather work to achieve control through local county noxious weed control boards and weed districts. For that reason, we work to improve communication, gain cooperation and improve coordination of the collective efforts for noxious weed control. Finally, we believe that noxious weed control is best carried out by strong, adequately funded programs at the local level. Thus, we strive to build public support for local programs and to empower those programs to be more successful.     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROGRAM SUMMARY Noxious weeds threaten Washington's irreplaceable resources. These nonnative, invasive species threaten our agricultural base, rangelands, waterways, tidelands, parks, wildlife, property values, public health and safety, and the ecological health and diversity of our native ecosystems. While the economic effects of noxious weeds on agriculture are enormous, their effects on the natural resources and ecological diversity of the state compound these losses. Noxious weed infestations are the second leading cause of wildland habitat loss. These resources, once destroyed, are irreplaceable. Noxious weed control takes place at the local level. The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board (the Board) believes noxious weed control is best implemented at the local level by county noxious weed control boards and weed districts. Enhancing their effort by providing leadership, education, and coordination is the best investment the state of Washington can make for noxious weed control and the protection of its agricultural and other natural resources. The Board and the Washington State Department of Agriculture (the Department) currently work with 37 activated noxious weed control boards and 11 weed districts to implement the state's noxious weed laws. These local programs direct and leverage the substantial investment made by landowners throughout Washington for on-the-ground noxious weed control work. State programs support local efforts. Through its policies and weed listing process, the Board coordinates and supports local efforts. During 2001 and 2002, the Board focused its efforts on education; support for established county boards and districts; assistance for newly-created county boards; and improving effective working relationships with land management agencies. Many of the Board's activities are described on its new website, which is now at www.nwcb.wa.gov. The Department has concentrated on counties without weed boards, inter-county complaints, cooperative projects with state and federal partners, and on the Spartina and purple loosestrife programs. The upcoming biennium will bring continued efforts in these areas. State funds are spent efficiently and effectively. The Board focuses its limited resources on projects where it can maximize returns. This biennium, the Board continued to update its strategic plan to set clear priorities for expenditures of time and money and to provide a formal system for tracking progress. The Board accomplished several important and long-planned tasks, including relocating its operations near other agencies in Olympia. The Board's efforts contributed to bringing one county (Mason) without a weed board to the point where board members are being recruited. It also produced numerous educational events, displays and publications, which are detailed in the body of the report.  1   Current noxious section,             systems are producing success stories. Real-life examples of the work of weed agencies in Washington State are told in the ""Success Stories"" including: Kudzu, the scourge of the U.S. southeast, was detected in Washington State this biennium and was treated and eradicated. Quick action kept the spines of camelthorn from spreading to injure range animals in Chelan County. The state's only infestation of Eggleaf spurge, a close relative of a plant that has devastated vast tracts of the Great Plains was kept contained and heading toward eradication on Orcas Island. A diverse taskforce continued its gains against saltcedar, a plant that uses so much water it can actually lower underground water levels. Agencies and insects have teamed up to greatly reduce infestations of purple loosestrife, which once covered thousands of acres of south central Washington. Persistence over six years reduced the amount of toxic tansy ragwort along a stretch of Whatcom County highway to six percent of its previous volume. Education thwarted a comeback of African rue, which had taken 10 years to eradicate from Grant County. Four counties and the Colville Tribe have deployed insects to save grasslands from invasive weeds, with significant results.  The vast majority of noxious weed control in Washington State is funded privately by property owners, as intended by the Legislature and required by RCW 17.10. Through its policies and activities, the Board directs the noxious weed control efforts of county weed boards and weed districts, as well as public and private landowners. Many of the Board's expenditures produce amplified and highly-leveraged benefits. Noxious weed control is an on-going component of a healthy, productive Washington. We have the opportunity to protect Washington from many noxious weeds that are costing other western states billions of dollars in resource and productivity loss and management costs. In order to accomplish this goal, there must be an ongoing commitment to the state's noxious weed program.  RECOMMENDATIONS In summary, the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board recommends that the State continue to leverage the private and local investments made in noxious weed control by maintaining existing general fund support for Washington's noxious weed control program, including the Department and the Board. By maintaining this funding, the Board can continue to coordinate noxious weed control efforts in Washington and help county weed boards and weed districts do their jobs.  2   STATUS REPORT:  WASHINGTON'S NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL PROGRAM SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Washington's noxious weeds are non-native, invasive plants that have been introduced to the state though human actions. Most of these species were brought in without any natural enemies, such as insects or diseases, to help keep their populations in check. As a result, these plants can often multiply rapidly. In the U.S., introduced weeds are spreading and invading approximately 1.7 million acres per year of wildlife habitat alone. Introductions of non-native species have been implicated in many of the natural resource and conservation problems the world faces today. Noxious weeds result in U.S. crop losses estimated at $26 billion a year. In addition, introduced species are the second leading cause of reductions in biological diversity. According to University of California biologist Michael Soule', ""Invasive alien plants pose a significant threat to the biodiversity of natural areas, to life on the planet."" Of the 250 U.S. plant species federally listed as threatened or endangered, introduced weeds have been implicated in the decline of at least 39 of them. Weed invasions also impact fish and wildlife. For example, spotted knapweed invasion of bunchgrass sites may Spotted knapweed reduce available winter forage for elk by as much as 50 to 90 percent. When knapweed replaces dense, native vegetation in riparian areas, it can increase soil erosion, which may ruin spawning habitat for salmon. The impacts of noxious weeds and other invasive species have been recognized at the highest levels of government. In 1999, Then-President Clinton issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to expand and coordinate efforts to combat the introduction and spread of non-native plants and animals. Several states are expanding their noxious weed programs. While many entities are just beginning to address the issue, Washington has a long history of noxious weed control efforts. Washington's first noxious weed law, which dealt with Canada and Chinese thistles, was passed in 1881 - eight years before statehood. Noxious weed laws have been updated and refined many times since then to accommodate new information and changing needs. As a result, Washington has one of the nation's best noxious weed control programs. The following pages summarize Washington's noxious weed program and some of its challenges and accomplishments for 2001 and 2002. 3   SUMMARY OF PROGRAM ORGANIZATION The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board (the Board) believes noxious weed control is best implemented at the local level by the 48 county noxious weed control boards and weed districts in Washington. Enhancing their effort by providing leadership, direction, education, and coordination is the best investment the state of Washington can make for noxious weed control and the protection of its agriculture and other natural resources. The Board and the Washington State Department of Agriculture (the Department) currently work with 37 activated noxious weed control boards to implement the state's chief noxious weed control law, Chapter 17.10 RCW Noxious Weeds  Control Boards. The Board and the Department also work cooperatively with 11 weed districts formed under older noxious weed laws, chapters 17.04 RCW Weed Districts and 17.06 RCW Intercounty Weed Districts. Each of these laws has assigned primary responsibility for noxious weed control to the landowner as steward of the land. Thus, private funds pay for the vast majority of noxious weed control in this state. The relatively smaller amounts spent by local and state agencies leverage this much larger private investment. Regulatory responsibility for ensuring compliance with the noxious weed laws has been assigned to local county noxious weed control boards and weed districts formed under these laws. The Department has regulatory responsibility when no local program has been activated. These local boards and districts carry out the state's noxious weed law at the local level. Each county board is composed of five directors who volunteer their time and effort to oversee the county noxious weed program. Washington State University Cooperative Extension agents serve as ex-officio, non-voting county weed board members. The 11 weed districts were formed from the 1930's through the 1960's, with three volunteer directors per district. Each local board and district has the authority to hire staff to regulate the control of noxious weeds in its jurisdiction. Local weed boards and districts provide many services to the communities they serve, including:  Early detection surveys designed to identify noxious weeds in the early stages of invasion  before large-scale resource damage occurs;  Technical assistance and education on noxious weeds, prevention strategies, and control options for landowners;  Enforcement of noxious weed control responsibilities to ensure resource protection and uniform standards; and  Local flexibility and the ability to address local weed control priorities. Funding of these local programs is either through a weed assessment on land or an appropriation from the county general fund. Currently, slightly over half of county weed boards are funded by a weed assessment on land. The remainder has budgets appropriated from the county general fund. Whether assessment or general fund, more than $6.1 million are locally invested in the annual budgets of  4   these programs statewide. They, in turn, direct the substantial investment made by landowners throughout Washington for actual noxious weed control work. The Board helps make this local investment work for the benefit of the state by providing leadership, direction, and coordination to these local weed boards and weed districts. The Board is composed of 12 volunteer members. Nine voting members represent county weed programs in all regions of the state, weed districts, county legislative authorities, the public interest, and the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Three non-voting members are scientific advisors. The Board:  Determines and adopts the annual state noxious weed list;  Gathers and distributes information on noxious weed species and control strategies;  Coordinates training, technical assistance, control strategies, and educational program development at a county, state, and regional level;  Supports and promotes the activation of local weed control boards;  Assists in the development and promotion of biological control projects;  Conducts and supports prevention programs and early detection surveys;  Promotes cooperation, compliance, and coordination of weed control activities between 37 county weed boards, 11 weed districts, 12 state and federal land management agencies, 34 Indian nations, two neighboring states, and one province. The Department is the final component of Washington's noxious weed control program. State weed law authorizes the Department to:  Perform any necessary enforcement activities in counties without activated weed boards, and  Negotiate and rule in inter-county disputes. Strong cooperation and interaction between the Board, the Department, and county noxious weed control boards and weed districts are the keys to the success of Washington's statewide noxious weed program. STATE NOXIOUS WEED LIST Each year, the Board coordinates and influences noxious weed control activities statewide through adoption, by rule, of the state noxious weed list. None of the weeds on the Washington State Noxious Weed List are native to the state; they have all been introduced from other parts of the world through human actions. The noxious weed list determines which plants will be considered noxious weeds and where in Washington control will be required. This approach allows control activities of landowners, public and private, to be prioritized toward the protection and enhancement of Washington's agricultural and natural resources in the most cost-effective manner.  5   1. Prevention New noxious weeds are to be prevented from establishing in the state. Prevention is the process of forestalling the contamination of an area by a noxious weed. It includes measures taken to stop the introduction and spread of a specific species into areas not currently infested. This far-sighted approach, similar to preventative medicine, pays great economic and natural resource dividends. Prevention is achieved through legislation, regulation, and landowner education. For example, quarantines enacted by the Department prohibit the transport, sale and purchase of 82 non-native, invasive plants. These quarantines prevent the continued introduction of these species through plant sales. Some of the state's worst noxious weeds, such as purple loosestrife, Scotch broom, and Dalmatian toadflax, were intentionally introduced as ornamentals. 2. Eradication Small infestations of newly established noxious weed species are to be eradicated at the smallest possible population level and earliest possible opportunity. Eradication means to eliminate a noxious weed within a geographical area. Eradication is mandated during the early stages of invasion while population levels are low and infested sites are few. Early action not only has the greatest chance of success, but also minimizes expense and resource damage. Eradication is accomplished by survey, monitoring, education, regulation, and site-appropriate vegetation management. 3. Containment Noxious weeds that have become established to such an extent that eradication is no longer feasible are to be contained. Contain means to confine a noxious weed and its propagules to an identified area of infestation. Containment can involve a variety of control and suppression measures, including mechanical, cultural, chemical, and biological control, as well as landowner education and other appropriate weed management strategies. The historical emphasis of Washington's noxious weed law was to protect the economic interests of commercial agriculture in the state. While the effects of noxious weeds on agriculture are enormous, their effects on the natural resources and ecological diversity of the state are immeasurable. These resources, once destroyed, are irreplaceable. Noxious weeds threaten not only our agricultural base, but also our rangelands, waterways, parks, wildlife, property values, public health and safety, and the ecological health and diversity of our native ecosystems. In recognition of these multiple impacts, Chapter 17.10 RCW was updated in 1997 to include limiting economic loss and adverse effects to Washington's agricultural, natural, and human resources.  6   The Board systematically classifies noxious weeds based on the stage of invasion of each species. The classification system is designed to: 1) prevent small infestations from becoming large infestations; 2) contain already established infestations to regions of the state where they occur and prevent their movement to non-infested areas; and 3) allow flexibility at the local level to include widespread weeds for landowner management programs. A complete noxious weed list is published annually in Chapter 16-750 WAC. There are 29 Class A noxious weeds in Washington. Class A weeds are non-native species with a limited distribution in the state. Therefore, eradication of all Class A noxious weeds is required by state law.

These species are established in some regions of Washington but are of limited distribution or not present in other regions of the state. In regions where a Class B weed is unrecorded or of limited distribution, prevention of seed production is required. In these areas, the weed is a ""Class B designate,"" meaning it is designated for control by state law. In regions where a Class B species is already abundant or widespread, control is a local option. In these areas, the Giant knotweed weed is a ""Class B non-designate,"" with containment, gradual reduction, and prevention of further spread being the chief goals.

Each species is already widely established in Washington or of special interest to the state's agricultural industry. Placement on the state noxious weed list allows counties to enforce control if locally desired. Other counties may choose simply to provide education or technical consultation to county residents. Canada thistle, a Class C noxious weed, illustrates the desirability of a law that provides local flexibility. This species is widely established in Washington, and most counties prefer to provide technical consultation to landowners on methods of suppression and control. However, enforcement of control is the preferred policy in counties where certified seed is grown.

Reasons for inclusion on the monitor list include: information indicating the species poses a potential threat; a need for additional information on distribution, abundance or biology; a need to monitor for reoccurrence; a need to verify the existence or identification of a species or to obtain a specimen; or the existence of a species in an Unicorn-plant adjacent state or province that is not known to occur in Washington. Information collected on monitor list species may be used to justify future inclusion on the state noxious weed list. There is no regulatory aspect to the monitor list.  10   Table 4. 2002 Monitor List Common name Bedstraw, foothills Bladderwort, swollen Bursage, skeletonleaf Cattail, lesser Cinquefoil, silvery Crosswort, narrowleaved Deadnettle, hybrid Fatoua Fieldcress, creeping Halogeton Inula Knapweed, featherhead Mallow, Venice  Scientific name Galium pedemontanum Utricularia inflata Ambrosia tomentosa Typha angustifolia Potentilla argentea Crucianella angustifolia Lamium hybridum Fatoua villosa Rorippa sylvestris Halogeton glomeratus Inula helenium Centaurea tricocephala Hibiscus trionum  Common name Matgrass Mullein, common Peganum Pheasants-eye Reed, common Rupturewort Thistle, distaff Unicorn-plant Verbena, tall Watercress Waterhyacinth Willow-herb, hairy  Scientific name Nardus stricta Verbascum thapsus Peganum harmala Adonis aestivalis Phragmites australis Herniaria cinerea Carthamus lanatus Proboscidea louisianica Verbena bonariensis Rorippa nasturtiumaquaticum Eichornia crassipes Epilobium hirsutum  11   WASHINGTON STATE NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL BOARD The Board serves as the state's noxious weed coordination center. Through its actions and policy decisions, it serves to coordinate and assist the activities of 48 county noxious weed control boards and weed districts in Washington. Together, the state and local programs leverage and direct the much-larger total weed control efforts funded by property owners. Program Status: The Board experienced significant change in its staff, operations and facilities during the past biennium. Beginning in May of 2001, the Board experienced 100% turnover in its 2.4 person staff. Also in May of 2001, the Board office was moved from its longtime home in Kent to Puyallup. Two months later, it was moved to the Natural Resources Building in Olympia. The Executive Secretary position was vacant from July of 2001 to mid-October 2002. The Education Specialist position, the only other full-time position with the Board, was vacant from May of 2001 until March of 2002. It was in September of 2001, during the period of State Weed Board staff vacancies, that Kudzu was discovered in Clark County. Although Clark County staff issued an alert to state government, that message did not get relayed to weed professionals statewide until later, when the Board staff had been reestablished. This event illustrates the key role that the small Board staff plays in the much larger statewide weed control network. Education: Under Chapter 17.10 RCW, the Board is required to ""disseminate information relating to noxious weeds to county noxious weed control boards and weed districts and ...work to coordinate the educational and weed control efforts of the various county and regional noxious weed control boards and weed districts."" (RCW 17.10.070). The Board's education program has focused on increasing the awareness of exotic species and their associated threats by providing information to the general public and others. The education program has included: New Educational Displays          Plant identification classes for county weed board and weed district staff, as well as local, state, and federal agency and tribal resource managers; Training for 6th-12th grade teachers on incorporating noxious weeds into their curricula; Assistance with county workshops to educate local citizens on weed identification and control; Hands-on weed identification training for volunteer groups, such as Master Gardeners;  12         Presentations on noxious and quarantined ornamental plants for WSDA nursery inspectors and community college horticulture classes; Continuing education for vegetation management professionals at conferences, such as the Washington State Weed Association Annual Conference. Assistance in development of weed education materials for fifth grade students through the nonprofit organization Ag. in the Classroom. Staffing of a weed education display at the Northwest Flower & Garden Show, which annually draws attendance of up to 80,000.  This biennium, Kathy Hamel, one of the Board's scientific advisors, volunteered to help update the Board's web page, which serves as a central storehouse of information on the Board, state weed laws, county weed programs, and noxious weed biology and control. The web site has also been moved to a new location, which allows direct and frequent maintenance and updating by Board staff, and it can now be found at http://www.nwcb.wa.gov. The site features detailed information and color photographs of the state's noxious weeds. Many educational materials are included on the site and can be downloaded directly. The web site has become a popular resource for weed professionals, as well as the general public. The Board also worked to provide printed educational materials. Staff worked with counties and districts this biennium to organize a group purchase of the popular booklet, ""Selected Noxious Weeds of Washington State."" Forty-four agencies combined their orders to purchase 62,000 copies of the publication, which features color pictures and descriptions of 48 noxious weed species. The result of this effort was that all of the public agencies paid a unit price for the books that was a fraction of what would have otherwise been required. Staff also collaborated Weed Board Publications this biennium to design a new bulletin explaining the new listing of four cultivars of English ivy as class ""C"" noxious weeds. All materials include color weed photos, along with information on identification and control. These materials were shared with county weed boards and weed districts. In addition, the Board produces a quarterly ""Update"" on noxious weed issues and activities that is distributed around the state. To reach a broader audience, information is also provided to newspapers, resulting in informative articles on noxious weeds.  13   The sale of noxious weeds as ornamentals continues to be a problem. Although the sale of many noxious weed species has been prohibited in Washington for several years, the task of informing all vendors is enormous. Over the past biennium, staff has provided training to Department nursery inspectors, so the inspectors can be familiar with quarantined plants that may not be sold in nurseries. The Board also monitors mail order catalogs for the sale of noxious weeds. An educational letter, explaining the problems associated with noxious weeds and the Department's quarantine regulations, is sent to companies that are selling noxious weeds. In the Parrotfeather coming months, the Board plans to send another educational mailing to all licensed nurseries in Washington, continuing an effort to make them aware of noxious weed quarantines and recent changes to the regulations. A Board staff member has been named to the search committee to replace a key horticulturist at the WSU Extension Service. In addition, the Board continues recruiting efforts to re-fill the ""horticulture industry representative"" seat on its Noxious Weed Committee. The education program also offers technical and scientific research support to the noxious weed listing process. The Board is charged with maintaining written findings on all species on the state noxious weed list. Written findings serve as a summary of available information on a weed species' history, distribution, biology, and control. All written findings are made available on the Board's web page. Education and public awareness will continue to be an important part of the Board's programs. Support for noxious weed boards has primarily come from the agricultural sector and this remains an important base of support. Many citizens and elected officials not involved in agriculture or natural resource protection are not aware of the resource damage caused by noxious weeds. Education and outreach to this broad range of interest groups and citizens will broaden the base of support for noxious weed control efforts and develop coalitions between agricultural and non-agricultural interest groups. Support for County Boards and Districts: Supporting and assisting county weed boards and districts is one of the Board's highest priorities. Service to them can take many forms. The following is a sample of the Board's support activities during the current biennium:  Advised San Juan, Lewis , Pend Oreille, Kitsap and Snohomish Counties and others on assessment funding and provided them with statewide assessment data. Participated in assessment-related public events in several of these counties. 14                 EXPENDITURES OF STATE FUNDS All of Washington benefits from ensuring control of the state's most serious noxious weeds. Even citizens whose properties are uninfested benefit because the effective control of noxious weeds protects their property and the recreation and natural areas they enjoy from similar infestations and related costs of control. Public awareness and education campaigns build diverse support for noxious weed control efforts. Recognizing the importance of noxious weed control, Washington has invested state general funds to support the current state and local noxious weed control programs for the last eight biennia. During the first four biennial funding cycles after the creation of Washington's noxious weed program in its current form, the state's investment supported three programs: (1) the Department; (2) the Board; and (3) the grant program, where funds were used for local noxious weed control projects throughout Washington. For the 1995-1997 biennium, the Board chose to shift the focus of the noxious weed grant program into three initial components of statewide benefit: (1) education and public awareness; (2) special projects of statewide benefit; and (3) enforcement funds for the Department. The Board has continued this focus for the 2001-2002 biennium.  Table 6. State General Fund Support for Noxious Weed Program, 2002-2003.

The overall Board budget is only a small fraction of the amount spent on noxious weed control statewide. The vast majority of noxious weed control in Washington State is funded privately by property owners, as intended by the Legislature and required by RCW 17.10. Through its policies, the Board directs  29   the noxious weed control efforts of county well as public and private landowners.

The Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board recommends that the State continue to maximize and support the local investments made in noxious weed control by maintaining existing general fund support for Washington's noxious weed control program, including the Department and the Board. By maintaining this funding, the Board can continue to coordinate noxious weed control efforts in Washington and to help county weed boards and weed districts do their jobs.  30   APPENDICES 17.10 RCW ..........

There is created a state noxious weed control board comprised of nine voting members and three nonvoting members. Four of the voting members shall be elected by the members of the various activated county noxious weed control boards, and shall be residents of a county in which a county noxious weed control board has been activated and a member of said board, and those qualifications shall continue through their term of office. Two of these members shall be elected from the west side of the state, the crest of the Cascades being the dividing line, and two from the east side of the state. The director of agriculture is a voting member of the board. One voting member shall be elected by the directors of the various active weed districts formed under chapter 17.04 or 17.06 RCW. The Washington state association of counties appoints one voting member who shall be a member of a county legislative authority. The director shall appoint two voting members to represent the public interest, one from the west side and one from the east side of the state. The director shall also appoint three nonvoting members representing scientific disciplines relating to weed control. The term of office for all members of the board is three years from the date of election or appointment. The board, by rule, shall establish a position number for each elected position of the board and shall designate which county noxious weed control board members are eligible to [Ch. 17.10--p. 2]  RCW 17.10.040 Activation of inactive county noxious weed control board. An inactive county noxious weed control board may be activated by any one of the following methods: (1) Either within sixty days after a petition is filed by one hundred registered voters within the county or, on its own motion, the county legislative authority shall hold a hearing to determine whether there is a need, due to a damaging infestation of noxious weeds, to activate the county noxious weed control board. If such a need is found to exist, then the county legislative authority shall, in the manner provided by RCW 17.10.050, appoint five persons to the county's noxious weed control board. (2) If the county's noxious weed control board is not activated within one year following a hearing by the county legislative authority to determine the need for activation, then upon the filing with the state noxious weed control board of a petition comprised either of the signatures of at least two hundred registered voters within the county, or of the signatures of a majority of an adjacent county's noxious weed control board, the state board shall, within six months of the date of the filing, hold a hearing in the county to determine the need for activation. If a need for activation is found to exist, then the state board shall order the county legislative authority to activate the county's noxious weed control board and to appoint members to the board in the manner provided by RCW 17.10.050. (3) The director, upon request of the state noxious weed control board, shall order a county legislative authority to activate the noxious weed control board immediately if an infestation of a class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed designated for control on the state noxious weed list is confirmed in that county. The county legislative authority may, as an alternative to activating the noxious weed board, combat the class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed with county resources and personnel operating with the authorities and responsibilities imposed by this chapter on a county noxious weed control board. No county may continue without a noxious weed control board for a second consecutive year if the class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed has not been eradicated.

It is recognized that the prevention, control, and eradication of noxious weeds presents a problem for immediate as well as for future action. It is further recognized that immediate prevention, control, and eradication is practicable on some lands and that prevention, control, and eradication on other lands should be extended over a period of time. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter that county noxious weed control boards may use their discretion and, by agreement with the owners of land, may propose and accept plans for prevention, control, and eradication that may be extended over a period of years. The county noxious weed control board may make an agreement with the owner of any parcel of land by contract between the landowner and the respective county noxious weed control board, and the board shall enforce the terms of any agreement. The county noxious weed control board may make any terms that will best serve the interests of the owners of the parcel of land and the  37  [Ch. 17.10--p. 5]   17.10.154  Noxious Weeds--Control Boards facie evidence that proper notice was given. If seed or other propagule dispersion is imminent, immediate control action may be taken forty-eight hours following the time that notification is reasonably expected to have been received by the owner or agent by certified mail or personal service, instead of ten days. If a landowner received a notice of violation from the county noxious weed control board in a prior growing season, removal or destruction of all above ground plant parts may be required at the most effective point in the growing season, as determined by the county weed board, which may be before or after propagule dispersion. (2) The county noxious weed control board or its authorized agents may issue a notice of civil infraction as provided for in RCW 17.10.230, 17.10.310, and 17.10.350 to owners who do not take action to control noxious weeds in accordance with the notice. (3) If the owner does not take action to control the noxious weeds in accordance with the notice, the county board may control them, or cause their being controlled, at the expense of the owner. The amount of the expense constitutes a lien against the property and may be enforced by proceedings on the lien except as provided for by RCW 79.44.060. The owner is liable for payment of the expense, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collection of any judgment on account thereof by any means available pursuant to law, in substitution for enforcement of the lien. Necessary costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the county noxious weed control board in carrying out this section may be recovered at the same time as a part of the action filed under this section. Funds received in payment for the expense of controlling noxious weeds shall be transferred to the county noxious weed control board to be expended as required to carry out the purposes of this chapter. (4) The county auditor shall record in his or her office any lien created under this chapter, and any lien shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum from the date on which the county noxious weed control board approves the amount expended in controlling the weeds. (5) As an alternative to the enforcement of any lien created under subsection (3) of this section, the county legislative authority may by resolution or ordinance require that each lien created be collected by the treasurer in the same manner as a delinquent real property tax, if within thirty days from the date the owner is sent notice of the lien, including the amount thereof, the lien remains unpaid and an appeal has not been made pursuant to RCW 17.10.180. Liens treated as delinquent taxes bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum and the interest accrues as of the date notice of the lien is sent to the owner: PROVIDED, That any collections for the lien shall not be considered as tax.

Any authorized agent or employee of the county noxious weed control board or of the state noxious weed control board or of the department of agriculture where not otherwise proscribed by law may enter upon any property for the purpose of administering this chapter and any power exercisable pursuant thereto, including the taking of specimens of weeds, general inspection, and the performance of eradication or control work. Prior to carrying out the purpose for which the entry is made, the official making such entry or someone in his or her behalf, shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner of the property as to the purpose and need for the entry. (1) When there is probable cause to believe that there is property within this state not otherwise exempt from process or execution upon which noxious weeds are standing or growing and the owner refuses permission to inspect the property, a judge of the superior court or district court in the county in which the property is located may, upon the request of the county noxious weed control board or its agent, issue a warrant directed to the board or agent authorizing the taking of specimens of weeds or other materials, general inspection, and the performance of eradication or control work. (2) Application for issuance and execution and return of the warrant authorized by this section shall be in accordance with the applicable rules of the superior court or the district courts. (3) Nothing in this section requires the application for and issuance of any warrant not otherwise required by law: PROVIDED, That civil liability for negligence shall lie in any case in which entry and any of the activities connected therewith are not undertaken with reasonable care. (4) Any person who improperly prevents or threatens to prevent entry upon land as authorized in this section or any person who interferes with the carrying out of this chapter shall be upon conviction guilty of a misdemeanor.

(1) Whenever the county noxious weed control board finds that noxious weeds are present on any parcel of land, and that the owner is not taking prompt and sufficient action to control the noxious weeds, pursuant to the provisions of RCW 17.10.140, it shall notify the owner that a violation of this chapter exists. The notice shall be in writing and sent by certified mail, and shall identify the noxious weeds found to be present, order prompt control action, and specify the time, of at least ten days from issuance of the notice, within which the prescribed action must be taken. Upon deposit of the certified letter of notice, the noxious weed control authority shall make an affidavit of mailing that is prima [Ch. 17.10--p. 6]  38  (2002)   Noxious Weeds--Control Boards liable pursuant to RCW 17.10.170 or 17.10.210. The board shall send notice by certified mail within thirty days, to each owner at the owner's last known address, as to any charge or cost and as to his or her right of a hearing. The hearing shall be scheduled within forty-five days of notification. Any determination or final action by the board is subject to judicial review by a proceeding in the superior court in the county in which the property is located, and the court has original jurisdiction to determine any suit brought by the owner to recover damages allegedly suffered on account of control work negligently performed: PROVIDED, That no stay or injunction shall lie to delay any control work subsequent to notice given pursuant to RCW 17.10.160 or pursuant to an order under RCW 17.10.210. [1997 c 353  22; 1987 c 438  19; 1969 ex.s. c 113  18.] RCW 17.10.190 Notice and information as to noxious weed control. Each activated county noxious weed control board must publish annually, and at other times as may be appropriate, in at least one newspaper of general circulation within its area, a general notice. The notice shall direct attention to the need for noxious weed control and give other information concerning noxious weed control requirements as may be appropriate, or indicate where such information may be secured. In addition to the general notice required, the county noxious weed control board may use any appropriate media for the dissemination of information to the public as may be calculated to bring the need for noxious weed control to the attention of owners. The board may consult with individual owners concerning their problems of noxious weed control and may provide them with information and advice, including giving specific instructions and methods when and how certain named weeds are to be controlled. The methods may include some combination of physical, mechanical, cultural, chemical, and/or biological methods, including livestock. Publication of a notice as required by this section is not a condition precedent to the enforcement of this chapter. [1997 c 353  23; 1987 c 438  20; 1975 1st ex.s. c 13  9; 1969 ex.s. c 113  19.] RCW 17.10.201 Noxious weed control on federal and tribal lands--State and county cooperation. (1) The state noxious weed control board shall: (a) Work with the various federal and tribal land management agencies to coordinate state and federal noxious weed control; (b) Encourage the various federal and tribal land management agencies to devote more time and resources to noxious weed control; and (c) Assist the various federal and tribal land management agencies by seeking adequate funding for noxious weed control. (2) County noxious weed control boards and weed districts shall work with the various federal and tribal land management agencies in each county in order to: (a) Identify new noxious weed infestations; (b) Outline and plan necessary noxious weed control actions; (c) Develop coordinated noxious weed control programs; and (2002)  17.10.180  (d) Notify local federal and tribal agency land managers of noxious weed infestations. (3) The department of agriculture, county noxious weed control boards, and weed districts are authorized to enter federal lands, with the approval of the appropriate federal agency, to survey for and control noxious weeds where control measures of a type and extent required under this chapter have not been taken. (4) The department of agriculture, county noxious weed control boards, and weed districts may bill the federal land management agency that manages the land for all costs of the noxious weed control performed on federal land. If not paid by the federal agency that manages the land, the cost of the noxious weed control on federal land may be paid from any funds available to the county noxious weed control board or weed district that performed the noxious weed control. Alternatively, the costs of noxious weed control on federal land may be paid from any funds specifically appropriated to the department of agriculture for that purpose. (5) The department of agriculture, county noxious weed control boards, and weed districts are authorized to enter into any reasonable agreement with the appropriate authorities for the control of noxious weeds on federal or tribal lands. (6) The department of agriculture, county noxious weed control boards, and weed districts shall consult with state agencies managing federal land concerning noxious weed infestation and control programs. [1997 c 353  34.] RCW 17.10.205 Control of noxious weeds in open areas. Open areas subject to the spread of noxious weeds, including but not limited to subdivisions, school grounds, playgrounds, parks, and rights of way shall be subject to regulation by activated county noxious weed control boards in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided for all terrestrial and aquatic lands of the state. [1997 c 353  24; 1975 1st ex.s. c 13  16.] RCW 17.10.210 Quarantine of land -- Order -- Expense. (1) Whenever the director, the county noxious weed control board, or a weed district finds that a parcel of land is so seriously infested with class A or class B noxious weeds that control measures cannot be undertaken thereon without quarantining the land and restricting or denying access thereto or use thereof, the director, the county noxious weed control board, or weed district, with the approval of the director of the department of agriculture, may issue an order for the quarantine and restriction or denial of access or use. Upon issuance of the order, the director, the county noxious weed control board, or the weed district shall commence necessary control measures and may institute legal action for the collection of costs for control work, which may include attorneys' fees and the costs of other appropriate actions. (2) An order of quarantine shall be served, by any method sufficient for the service of civil process, on all persons known to qualify as owners of the land within the meaning of this chapter. (3) The director shall, with the advice of the state noxious weed control board, determine how the expense of control work undertaken pursuant to this section, and the  39  [Ch. 17.10--p. 7]   17.10.210  Noxious Weeds--Control Boards section. Funding for the budget is derived from any or all of the following: (a) The county legislative authority may, in lieu of a tax, levy an assessment against the land for this purpose. Prior to the levying of an assessment the county noxious weed control board shall hold a public hearing at which it will gather information to serve as a basis for classification and then classify the lands into suitable classifications, including but not limited to dry lands, range lands, irrigated lands, nonuse lands, forest lands, or federal lands. The board shall develop and forward to the county legislative authority, as a proposed level of assessment for each class, an amount as seems just. The assessment rate shall be either uniform per acre in its respective class or a flat rate per parcel rate plus a uniform rate per acre: PROVIDED, That if no benefits are found to accrue to a class of land, a zero assessment may be levied. The county legislative authority, upon receipt of the proposed levels of assessment from the board, after a hearing, shall accept or modify by resolution, or refer back to the board for its reconsideration all or any portion of the proposed levels of assessment. The amount of the assessment constitutes a lien against the property. The county legislative authority may by resolution or ordinance require that notice of the lien be sent to each owner of property for which the assessment has not been paid by the date it was due and that each lien created be collected by the treasurer in the same manner as delinquent real property tax, if within thirty days from the date the owner is sent notice of the lien, including the amount thereof, the lien remains unpaid and an appeal has not been made pursuant to RCW 17.10.180. Liens treated as delinquent taxes bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum and the interest accrues as of the date notice of the lien is sent to the owner: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any collections for the lien shall not be considered as tax; or (b) The county legislative authority may appropriate money from the county general fund necessary for the administration of the county noxious weed control program. In addition the county legislative authority may make emergency appropriations as it deems necessary for the implementation of this chapter. (2) Forest lands used solely for the planting, growing, or harvesting of trees and which are typified, except during a single period of five years following clear-cut logging, by canopies so dense as to prohibit growth of an understory may be subject to an annual noxious weed assessment levied by a county legislative authority that does not exceed onetenth of the weighted average per acre noxious weed assessment levied on all other lands in unincorporated areas within the county that are subject to the weed assessment. This assessment shall be computed in accordance with the formula in subsection (3) of this section. (3) The calculation of the ""weighted average per acre noxious weed assessment"" is a ratio expressed as follows: (a) The numerator is the total amount of funds estimated to be collected from the per acre assessment on all lands except (i) forest lands as identified in subsection (2) of this section, (ii) lands exempt from the noxious weed assessment, and (iii) lands located in an incorporated area. (b) The denominator is the total acreage from which funds in (a) of this subsection are collected. For lands of less than one acre in size, the denominator calculation may  cost of any quarantine in connection therewith, is apportioned.

(1) The director of agriculture shall adopt, with the advice of the state noxious weed control board, rules designating noxious weed seeds which shall be controlled in products, screenings, or articles to prevent the spread of noxious weeds. The rules shall identify the products, screenings, and articles in which the seeds must be controlled and the maximum amount of the seed to be permitted in the product, screenings, or article to avoid a hazard of spreading the noxious weed by seed from the product, screenings, or article. The director shall also adopt, with the advice of the state board, rules designating toxic weeds which shall be controlled in feed stuffs and screenings to prevent injury to the animal that consumes the feed. The rules shall identify the feed stuffs and screenings in which the toxic weeds must be controlled and the maximum amount of the toxic weed to be permitted in the feed. Rules developed under this section shall identify ways that products, screenings, articles, or feed stuffs containing noxious weed seeds or toxic weeds can be made available for beneficial uses. (2) Any person who knowingly or negligently sells or otherwise distributes a product, article, screenings, or feed stuff designated by rule containing noxious weed seeds or toxic weeds designated for control by rule and in an amount greater than the amount established by the director for the seed or weed by rule is guilty of a misdemeanor. (3) The department of agriculture shall, upon request of the buyer, inspect products, screenings, articles, or feed stuffs designated by rule and charge fees, in accordance with chapter 22.09 RCW, to determine the presence of designated noxious weed seeds or toxic weeds.

(1) The activated county noxious weed control board of each county shall annually submit a budget to the county legislative authority for the operating cost of the county ' s weed program for the ensuing fiscal year: PROVIDED, That if the board finds the budget approved by the legislative authority is insufficient for an effective county noxious weed control program it shall petition the county legislative authority to hold a hearing as provided in RCW 17.10.890. Control of weeds is a benefit to the lands within any such [Ch. 17.10--p. 8]  40  (2002)   Noxious Weeds--Control Boards be based on the following assumptions: (i) Unimproved lands are calculated as being one-half acre in size on the average, and (ii) improved lands are calculated as being onethird acre in size on the average. The county legislative authority may choose to calculate the denominator for lands of less than one acre in size using other assumptions about average parcel size based on local information. (4) For those counties that levy a per parcel assessment to help fund noxious weed control programs, the per parcel assessment on forest lands as defined in subsection (2) of this section shall not exceed one-tenth of the per parcel assessment on nonforest lands.

Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) is a herbaceous perennial that is one of the most serious noxious weeds of agronomic crops. It propagates by seed, rhizomes, bulbs, and nutlets. Soil containing nutlets is the primary mode of spread in cultivated land. It is highly invasive and its unchecked spread would entail great economic loss to the agricultural industries of the state. It is a class B noxious weed designated for cont r ol i n Cow l i t z a nd Th urst on c ount i e s (WA C 16- 750011(33)(a)). Yellow nutsedge infests a dredging spoil site at the Port of Kalama in Kalama, Washington and a plant nursery site at the Port of Olympia in Tumwater, Washington. Movement of material from these sites initiates additional  16 -75 2- 300  67  (5/29/02)   Noxious Weed Control infestations. RCW 17.10.210 provides that either the director or the county noxious weed control board or a weed district may issue an order for quarantine and restriction or denial of access to land determined to be so seriously infested that control measures cannot be undertaken without quarantine of the land. The director has determined: (1) That the identified sites are so seriously infested as to require quarantine; and (2) That the movement of contaminated materials from these sites presents an immediate threat of infestation to the rest of the county agricultural and nonagricultural areas; and (3) That the restriction of such spread is critical to control efforts.
