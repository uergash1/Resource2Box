West Virginians are familiar with the hazards of working in a mine and the respiratory diseases are caused by mine dust  black lung disease caused by coal dust was highly publicized as one of the states occupational safety woes.  Asbestos is no different; exposure to the tiny fibers that asbestos gives off when disturbed can cause asbestosis and mesothelioma cancer.  Asbestosis is reduction in lung capacity caused by scarring of the lungs while  malignant mesothelioma  is cancer that most often attacks the lining of the lungs and may ultimately lead to lung cancer.  In all cases, mesothelioma is incurable and fatal.   There are no asbestos mines in West Virginia but there are industries that made ample use of asbestos as insulation.  Old asbestos will crumble and give off dust containing asbestos fibers; inhaling them in a factory setting is just as dangerous as in a mine if there is daily exposure.   The oil refineries and power plants in West Virginia are likely sites for  asbestos exposure .  Steel mills are also considered highly hazardous, as are many buildings and even homes that have asbestos insulation.  That includes most buildings constructed prior to 1975.  West Virginia has its share of potential asbestos exposure sites, some of which are listed below.     If you were employed at one of these sites in the past two or three decades, you are a potential candidate for an asbestos-related disease.  Discuss the implications of your former job with your doctor; if you have been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease consult one of our experienced attorneys about the compensation that may be owed to you.

The survey shows 410 deaths in West Virginia associated with asbestosis over the two-decade period.  Mesothelioma deaths were in the range from 585 to 697 for the same period.  Those figures are high in comparison to many other states, taking total population into account.  In 1999 the federal government began tracking mesothelioma deaths carefully.  From 1999 through 2004 there were 149 deaths in West Virginia attributed to mesothelioma.

In Wisconsin a number of the large dairies and food processing plants used asbestos components in their production lines.  The paper mills in the state were all built prior to the ban on asbestos products.  The same is true of the canning factories and many of the schools and hospitals that were constructed as the state grew after World War II.  The same can be said of homes built prior to about 1980.  Popular asbestos construction products included roofing, flooring, ceiling tiles, wallboard, insulation, caulking and pipe fittings.   Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers that are at the root of asbestos-related health problems.  The fibers are long and slender; once they are inhaled or ingested they become imbedded in tissue within the body.  The worst asbestos related disease, mesothelioma cancer, is caused by asbestos fibers that are in the membranes lining the chest cavity and the abdominal cavity.  Asbestosis, another common affliction for those who had habitual exposure to asbestos, is reduction in lung capacity due to scarring of the lungs.   An unusual feature of malignant mesothelioma is that it can take up to twenty years or more after hazardous asbestos exposure to exhibit symptoms.  A person who worked around asbestos industrial products may be diagnosed with mesothelioma after leaving the job and living a healthy life for years.  For that reason mesothelioma remains a threat.   Below is a partial list of job sites in Wisconsin where asbestos exposure occurred.  If you ever were employed at one of these sites you should discuss the implications of asbestos exposure with your doctor and schedule regular checkups.  If you have been diagnosed with an asbestos related disease, get in touch with an experienced attorney who can make sure you receive the compensation owed to you by the asbestos industry.

The federal government began tracking deaths due to mesothelioma in 1999.  According to their data, there were 388 mesothelioma deaths in Wisconsin during the period from 1999 through 2004.  Clearly the disease remains a health issue despite the absence of asbestos products on the market and the efforts that have been made to clean up building and factories that contained asbestos.

As you must confront the facts and recognize, that time        has gone by so fast; that now... the little girl you once called your    sweet little angel; is now going to be celebrating her Sweet 15 or    16 (which ever one according to your heritage you celebrate).    Yes we know; it seems like it was just yesterday!    But now your faced with needing to throw her a very special party, and    that's where the ChristianDJs - Christian DJ comes in. You set the party    date, time, and guest list and then we bring it to life. Think we're    joking? Then just look at the next photo, where you will see fun in    action with an array of colors, smiles, and most important people out of    their seats!                                                                                     Aside from the Birthday    Girl herself - the next most important thing to a Christian Sweet    Sixteen or a Quince / Quinceara's Party is in fact - the entertainment!    Sorry guys believe it or not its not the food or the Banquet hall and    mind you; we don't say that, the industry experts for formal party    planning and major event coordinators say it. Like in the publish    magazines & TV Shows: The Knot, The Wedding, Bridal Magazine, & The hit    show Sweet Sixteen.                                                                                 This        is because people don't remember the food or the smell of the flowers. What    they do remember is... if they had a good time .                                       The fact remains, that statistics show that having a DJ    accounts for over 85% of people saying they had a great time at a party    and with ChristianDJs that's closer to 100%.            Again just look at the pictures and you can clearly see that we will get    your peoples out of their chairs and on to having fun at your birthday    party.                Think about it for a second... The food may    be of a great concern to you; however it is just another meal to your    guest.                 Now ask yourself in reality how long does it take to eat a full    plate of food? 20 minutes if that.                     Now ask yourself what are you and    your guest going to be doing for the next three and a half hours?                                       The bottom line is this... The ENTERTAINMENT selected is the KEY    FACTOR and MAIN INGREDIENT that will lead to the overall SUCCESS of your    Sweet Sixteen or Quinceara / Quince event.                                                                                 We can tell you that over the years we have had thousands of    people who have come up to us and to the host of the party to tell us            comments like these:                                ""This was the best party ever - I had so much fun    with the games the DJ played..."",             ""Where in the world did you find those DJs? Cause I    want them at my party"",         ""The Music was Great!!!"",                    ""Oh, you are the only guys I'm recommending."",   and so on.             In fact, forget words how about action. At a recent event after most of    the people came up to us - one pastor approached our table and  took all     of our    remaining business cards so that he could give them out and make them    available to both his congregation at his church and when outside    couples came to him for wanting to use the church for their respective    marriage ceremonies.        One extra special notable comment came from Denver, Colorado were a    guest said to the mother of the Quinceara right in front of us: "" This has been the best event    ever in the 15 year history of our church and a great deal of credit    goes to these guys over here (as he pointed to us).""           And to that we say: ""All Glory & Honor goes to God"".                           Now someone once said:                                  There's just no  party,                    like a Holy Ghost Party...           cause a Holy Ghost Party don't stop!       Well, whoever it was... they must have  been talking about a ChristianDJs event.                                                        Now don't forget to call Christian DJs to get your SHOUT & your DANCE ON because  you got the victory!

That    said, one of the main reasons why ChristianDJs - DJ service is chosen    time and time again, over other DJ services throughout the country is    because we actually have the ability to ENTERTAIN your all your invited    guest.     Now being that during the    course of an event we will be interacting with your family & friends, as    well with you and your other event vendors; it is important that we be    placed adjacent to the Main Dance Floor or as we like to call it ""The    Presentation & Activities Participation Area"".  In other words, we    can't do our job effectively if we                                                                                        (Img.1) are located outside, in another room,    or in a corner with no room to move.     Most formal banquet halls    already do have a Preset Band or DJ area. However, bands don't interact    with guest and other DJs or House DJs just press play on the CD player    and that's it, so most often than not their areas are set-up ""out of the    way"" so-to-speak. Please understand this is not the case with    ChristianDJs. Undoubtedly we need quick access to you, your guest, and    the dance floor.       Please note: you must have    the banquet hall provide for us a 6' or 8' foot long standard rectangle    type table for our set up and the table needs to be near at least (4)    20amp/electrical outlets sockets. In addition the table must be covered    and decorated in the same fashion as the other dinner/guest tables; so    as not to look out of place. (Please see IMG.3 below.)

Increasing sales volumes? Controlling unit inventory? Building a strong customer relationship base? Chances are you'd shake your head ""No"" to each one. While these three challenges might consume a good portion of your time and fall near the top of your list of concerns, it may be that dealing with the wants, needs and varied personalities of your staff is really what taxes you most. Whether your dealership is large or small, you'll almost invariably find yourself interacting with subordinates who differ from you in their abilities, reactions, attitudes, ambitions and expectations, or in their work approach, viewpoint, communication style, pace and level of confidence. Yet, somehow, you need to pull everyone together, expand the horizons of your business, boost morale and keep even the less-than-perfect employee fit enough to perform effectively. Gaining a firm grasp of your own unique work style along with the style of each team member can help you achieve multiple objectives — like increasing sales volumes, controlling unit inventory and building a strong customer relationship base. It is the key to your dealership's long-term growth and success. It's important to have specific, accurate insight into why you manage the way you do. Managers need to understand the how's and why's of their own motivational trigger buttons before they can tap into someone else's. Assuming everyone wants to be managed the way you think is a big mistake; plan to be flexible as a leader and modify your typical business techniques to suit each employee in order to gain respect, attention, enthusiasm and cooperation. There is no such thing as successful, one-size-fits-all management. And it's not until you assess your own typical on-the-job behavior that you'll be able to understand what each subordinate needs from you in order to accomplish goals. Mismanagement leads to low morale, frequent turnover, severed relationships, lost time, minimal productivity and high expenses. It can also be the real reason behind an employee's poor performance and sour disposition. Avoid falling prey by learning what you can do right now to grow your team to their full potential. Know the predictable behavior of your subordinates, and be certain that the responsibilities you assign, the expectations you hold and the goals you set are realistic and attainable for each uniquely wired member of your staff. While in theory there may be an almost endless array of personality trait combinations, here are a few of the more commonly seen ones, as well as some tips on how to motivate and manage them: Technically minded, methodical, passive workers These individuals respond best to clear, concise communication and often choose to ask questions or receive task-related information via e-mail versus interfacing. They're private people who favor predictability. Give them as much warning as possible of changes or due dates. Avoid rushing them. Stay available to provide direction; work them into a routine; and appreciate their inclination to think logically, cautiously and realistically. Fast-paced, highly sociable, easy-going workers Variety in their day; an upbeat, animated boss and readily-attainable objectives should keep these personalities satisfied and loyal. When a task calls for someone who likes talking to people and keeping busy, they will take it on readily. Keep them in low-pressure situations. Give tedious, number-based tasks to someone else. Use their diplomacy skills to your advantage in jobs like hospitality, reception, public relations, human relations or creative advertising. Competitive, authoritative, self-directing workers People who display a large measure of self-confidence and drive might seem hard to control in secondary roles, but they often find their niche in sales or management. Typically creative and bold, they value incentives, want to give their opinions, and enjoy challenges. Try not to dictate to them after-the-fact. One secret to harnessing the power of these leadership personalities lies in partnering with them, eliciting their views and making them feel they have an important say in many work-related matters. Managing becomes much easier once you know which motivational strategies work best for which employees. You also must be willing to vary your approach — at least to some degree. Some people respond best to clearly defined objectives, specific instructions and frequent feedback about their job performance. Expecting them to work with minimal oversight and jump into situations is unrealistic, and bound to lead to mutual frustration and resentment. Conversely, there are likely others on your team who expect from you quite the opposite. These less-structured workers want general overviews and freedom to make independent decisions, approaching a task from their own perspective. Requiring adherence to strict procedures or micromanaging them dilutes their creativity and almost always breeds underlying performance-hindering malcontent. Keying into the management style that is most effective with each individual has another advantage: it enables you to communicate in a way that your subordinate will understand. It's a time saver. For example, once you know that your newest hire is more reserved, fact-oriented and analytical, you can feel free to get right to the point when speaking and do so in a businesslike, straightforward fashion. Save your anecdotes and more casual conversations for someone else. When challenges and disagreements are prevalent at a dealership, employees and employers often blame one another. A manager might wonder when his subordinate will start to live up to expectations, while that same subordinate may simply label the boss ""a loser"" and start looking for another job. Without question, there are times when two people clash and there is nothing that can rectify the situation. Indeed, there may be such a bad fit with so little job or environmental compatibility that termination becomes the only option. However, in other cases, it may be that the reason we can't stand working with someone is really because we haven't taken the time to understand the person. The truth is that there are actions you, as a manager, can take — techniques you are free to adopt and apply that will make your job far less stressful. Knowing more about the predictable behaviors of your team makes it easier to devise succession plans; strategize; hire; promote; coach; and pinpoint where, when and how your employee investments can make the greatest difference. Developing your dealership's staff should be the top priority, but it's one that can be either bothersome or rewarding, depending on how willing you are to learn why your workers do the things they do.

Increasing sales volumes? Controlling unit inventory? Building a strong customer relationship base? Chances are you'd shake your head ""No"" to each one. While these three challenges might consume a good portion of your time and fall near the top of your list of concerns, it may be that dealing with the wants, needs and varied personalities of your staff is really what taxes you most. Whether your dealership is large or small, you'll almost invariably find yourself interacting with subordinates who differ from you in their abilities, reactions, attitudes, ambitions and expectations, or in their work approach, viewpoint, communication style, pace and level of confidence. Yet, somehow, you need to pull everyone together, expand the horizons of your business, boost morale and keep even the less-than-perfect employee fit enough to perform effectively. Gaining a firm grasp of your own unique work style along with the style of each team member can help you achieve multiple objectives — like increasing sales volumes, controlling unit inventory and building a strong customer relationship base. It is the key to your dealership's long-term growth and success. It's important to have specific, accurate insight into why you manage the way you do. Managers need to understand the how's and why's of their own motivational trigger buttons before they can tap into someone else's. Assuming everyone wants to be managed the way you think is a big mistake; plan to be flexible as a leader and modify your typical business techniques to suit each employee in order to gain respect, attention, enthusiasm and cooperation. There is no such thing as successful, one-size-fits-all management. And it's not until you assess your own typical on-the-job behavior that you'll be able to understand what each subordinate needs from you in order to accomplish goals. Mismanagement leads to low morale, frequent turnover, severed relationships, lost time, minimal productivity and high expenses. It can also be the real reason behind an employee's poor performance and sour disposition. Avoid falling prey by learning what you can do right now to grow your team to their full potential. Know the predictable behavior of your subordinates, and be certain that the responsibilities you assign, the expectations you hold and the goals you set are realistic and attainable for each uniquely wired member of your staff. While in theory there may be an almost endless array of personality trait combinations, here are a few of the more commonly seen ones, as well as some tips on how to motivate and manage them: Technically minded, methodical, passive workers These individuals respond best to clear, concise communication and often choose to ask questions or receive task-related information via e-mail versus interfacing. They're private people who favor predictability. Give them as much warning as possible of changes or due dates. Avoid rushing them. Stay available to provide direction; work them into a routine; and appreciate their inclination to think logically, cautiously and realistically. Fast-paced, highly sociable, easy-going workers Variety in their day; an upbeat, animated boss and readily-attainable objectives should keep these personalities satisfied and loyal. When a task calls for someone who likes talking to people and keeping busy, they will take it on readily. Keep them in low-pressure situations. Give tedious, number-based tasks to someone else. Use their diplomacy skills to your advantage in jobs like hospitality, reception, public relations, human relations or creative advertising. Competitive, authoritative, self-directing workers People who display a large measure of self-confidence and drive might seem hard to control in secondary roles, but they often find their niche in sales or management. Typically creative and bold, they value incentives, want to give their opinions, and enjoy challenges. Try not to dictate to them after-the-fact. One secret to harnessing the power of these leadership personalities lies in partnering with them, eliciting their views and making them feel they have an important say in many work-related matters. Managing becomes much easier once you know which motivational strategies work best for which employees. You also must be willing to vary your approach — at least to some degree. Some people respond best to clearly defined objectives, specific instructions and frequent feedback about their job performance. Expecting them to work with minimal oversight and jump into situations is unrealistic, and bound to lead to mutual frustration and resentment. Conversely, there are likely others on your team who expect from you quite the opposite. These less-structured workers want general overviews and freedom to make independent decisions, approaching a task from their own perspective. Requiring adherence to strict procedures or micromanaging them dilutes their creativity and almost always breeds underlying performance-hindering malcontent. Keying into the management style that is most effective with each individual has another advantage: it enables you to communicate in a way that your subordinate will understand. It's a time saver. For example, once you know that your newest hire is more reserved, fact-oriented and analytical, you can feel free to get right to the point when speaking and do so in a businesslike, straightforward fashion. Save your anecdotes and more casual conversations for someone else. When challenges and disagreements are prevalent at a dealership, employees and employers often blame one another. A manager might wonder when his subordinate will start to live up to expectations, while that same subordinate may simply label the boss ""a loser"" and start looking for another job. Without question, there are times when two people clash and there is nothing that can rectify the situation. Indeed, there may be such a bad fit with so little job or environmental compatibility that termination becomes the only option. However, in other cases, it may be that the reason we can't stand working with someone is really because we haven't taken the time to understand the person. The truth is that there are actions you, as a manager, can take — techniques you are free to adopt and apply that will make your job far less stressful. Knowing more about the predictable behaviors of your team makes it easier to devise succession plans; strategize; hire; promote; coach; and pinpoint where, when and how your employee investments can make the greatest difference. Developing your dealership's staff should be the top priority, but it's one that can be either bothersome or rewarding, depending on how willing you are to learn why your workers do the things they do.
