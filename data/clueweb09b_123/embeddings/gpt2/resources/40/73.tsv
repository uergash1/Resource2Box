GX058-03-12283898	The following material is from  Natural Resource Year in Review--1997 , published by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, in April 1998 (publication D-1247)       Chapter 5: RESTORATION     Issue Update     A new twist in the Elwha River ecosystem restoration by  Brian Winter  (Elwha Project Coordinator; Olympic National Park, Washington)      The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (P.L.   102-495) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire and   remove the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams on the Elwha River (Washington)   if that action is needed to fully restore the ecosystem and native   anadromous fisheries. In a report to the Congress and in an environmental   impact statement (EIS), the Secretary concluded that the removal   of both dams is necessary.      Through fiscal year 1998, $11 million has been appropriated for   Elwha Dam acquisition. Additional funds to acquire the dams may   be available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Washington   Senator Slade Gorton, a previous opponent of dam removal, now   supports acquisition of both dams, removal of the lower dam (Elwha),   and determination of the upper dam's (Glines Canyon–within Olympic   National Park) fate following documentation of salmon restoration   for 12 years after removal of the Elwha Dam.      Meeting Senator Gorton's proposal will require the development   of a supplemental EIS; the “phased removal” option was rejected   originally because of the added environmental impacts from two   distinct dam removal periods as opposed to simultaneous removal,   additional cost, and the delay in meeting the goal of the act.   Removal of just the lower dam (outside the park) will result in,   at most, the restoration of 30,000 salmon and steelhead compared   to the 392,000 that can be restored with both dams removed. Nevertheless,   Senator Gorton's proposal would allow the restoration process   to move forward. Funding to complete acquisition and removal of   the Elwha Dam will be decided in early 1998.

The continuing   increase in the number of nests at the park–nine during 1997–may   signal the success of a two-decade, international, multiagency   effort to establish a secondary nesting colony of this species   at the seashore.]      [photo not shown] Removal of the Glines Canyon Dam (shown) and   its downstream companion, the Elwha Dam, is necessary to fully   restore the native salmon and steelhead fishery in the Elwha River   drainage within and adjacent to Olympic National Park (Washington).

GX103-47-10938086	[Federal Register: July 20, 2000 (Volume 65, Number 140)] [Notices]                [Page 45099-45100] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr20jy00-88]                           -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  Fish and Wildlife Service    Availability of an Environmental Action Statement and Receipt of  an Application for a Permit To Enhance the Survival of the Northern  Idaho Ground Squirrel in Adams County, Idaho Under a Safe Harbor  Agreement  AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.  ACTION: Notice of availability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: Bob and Peggy Mack (Applicants) have applied to the Fish and  Wildlife Service (Service) for an enhancement of a survival permit  pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973,  as amended. The permit application includes a proposed Safe Harbor  Agreement (Agreement) between the Applicants and the Service. The  Agreement and permit application are available for public comment.     The Agreement allows for management and conservation of the  threatened northern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus  brunneus) on approximately 14 acres of private land, owned by the  Applicants, approximately 5.5 miles northwest of New Meadows, Idaho.  Northern Idaho ground squirrels currently occupy less than 5 of the 14  acres. The proposed duration of the Agreement is 10 years, and the  proposed term of the enhancement of a survival permit is 20 years.     Under the Agreement, a 5-acre area, which includes all the habitat  currently occupied by northern Idaho ground squirrels on the  Applicants' property, is identified as a protected area. This 5-acre  protected area would have a baseline greater than zero (0), and no  incidental take would be authorized under the permit within this area.  The Agreement allows for a variety of conservation measures to be  carried out by the Service within the 5-acre protected area to benefit  the conservation of northern Idaho ground squirrels. The permit would  authorize the Applicants to return the 9 acres outside of the 5-acre  protected area to the existing baseline condition of zero (0) northern  Idaho ground squirrels. We expect this Agreement to result in a net  conservation benefit by enhancing northern Idaho ground squirrel  habitat within the 5-acre protected area, and expanding the northern  Idaho ground squirrel population to lands outside the protected area.  Recovery of northern Idaho ground squirrels is expected to be enhanced  under the Agreement by improving habitat, expanding the northern Idaho  ground squirrel population at this site, and potentially providing a  population with surplus individuals for transplanting to other sites in  need of supplementation. Under the Agreement, the Applicants will  receive funding under the Service's Endangered Species Act Private  Landowner Incentive Program.     The Service has made a preliminary determination that the proposed  Agreement and permit application are eligible for categorical exclusion  under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. We explain the  basis for this determination in an Environmental Action Statement,  which also is available for public review.     We request comments from the public on the permit application, and  Agreement. All comments we receive, including names and addresses, will  become part of the administrative record and may be released to the  public.  DATES: Written comments should be received on or before August 21,  2000.  ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Dennis Mackey, Project  Biologist, Fish and Wildlife Service, 1387 S. Vinnell Way, Room 368,  Boise, Idaho 83709 (telephone: 208/378-5267; facsimile: 208/378-5262).  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dennis Mackey at the above address or  telephone 208/378-5267.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Document Availability      You may obtain copies of the documents for review by contacting the  individual named above. You also may make an appointment to view the  documents at the above address during normal business hours. The  documents are also available electronically on the World Wide Web at   http://www.fws.gov/r1srbo/ .  Background      Under a Safe Harbor Agreement, participating property owners  voluntarily undertake management activities on their property to  enhance, restore, or maintain habitat benefitting species listed under  the Endangered Species Act. Safe Harbor Agreements encourage private  and other non-Federal property owners to implement conservation efforts  for listed species by assuring property owners they will not be  subjected to increased property use restrictions if their efforts  attract listed species to their property or increase the numbers or  distribution of listed species already on their property. Application  requirements and issuance criteria for enhancement of survival permits  through Safe Harbor Agreements are found in 50 CFR 17.22(c).     We have worked with the Applicants to develop the proposed  Agreement for the conservation of northern Idaho ground squirrels on  their 14 acres of land in Adams County, Idaho. Less than 5 of the 14  acres are currently occupied by northern Idaho ground squirrels. Under  the proposed Agreement, the Applicants will: (1) Protect 5 acres of  occupied, suitable northern Idaho ground squirrel habitat from land use  activities that may result in ``take'' of ground squirrels; (2) allow  Service personnel access to the property to conduct ground squirrel  conservation activities such as habitat enhancement, artificial  feeding, ground squirrel surveys, and translocation of excess ground  squirrels should the current population expand beyond the 5-acre  protected area; (3) if appropriate, in cooperation with the Service,  develop signs to discourage shooting of ground squirrels; and (4) work  cooperatively with the Service on other issues  [[Page 45100]]  necessary to further the purposes of the Agreement.     Threats to the northern Idaho ground squirrel include: habitat loss  due to seral forest encroachment into suitable meadow habitats;  competition from Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus);  land use changes; recreational shooting; and naturally occurring  events. The Agreement provides a net conservation benefit to northern  Idaho ground squirrels by providing measures for ground squirrel  habitat protection and enhancement, managing competition from Columbian  ground squirrels, and controlling recreational shooting. The biological  goal of ground squirrel conservation measures in the Agreement is to  expand the northern Idaho ground squirrel population at this site  beyond the 5-acre protected area by reducing threats to the species.  The Agreement is expected to contribute to recovery of northern Idaho  ground squirrels by reducing threats and expanding the ground squirrel  population at this site. Recovery of the species would be enhanced by  increasing the viability of the population at this site and potentially  allowing ground squirrels to be translocated to other sites in need of  population supplementation.     Consistent with the Service's Safe Harbor policy, under the  Agreement, the Service would issue a permit to the Applicants  authorizing incidental take of northern Idaho ground squirrels, as a  result of activities on 9 acres of their property, outside the 5-acre  protected area. These activities include construction and use of the  Applicants' house, garage, and other associated out-buildings proposed  for development on the property; installation of a well, underground  power and telephone lines, a septic system/drainfield, and other  required utilities; and operation of all terrain vehicles. We expect  that the maximum level of incidental take authorized under the proposed  Agreement will never be realized. The level of incidental take would be  dependent on if, and how rapidly, northern Idaho ground squirrels  expand beyond the 5-acre protected area.     We are providing this notice pursuant to section 10(c) of the  Endangered Species Act and pursuant to implementing regulations for the  National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1506.6). We will evaluate the  permit application, associated documents, and comments submitted  thereon to determine whether the permit application meets the  requirements of section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act and  National Environmental Policy Act regulations. If we determine that the  requirements are met, we will sign the proposed Agreement and issue an  enhancement of survival permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the  Endangered Species Act to the Applicants for take of northern Idaho  ground squirrels incidental to otherwise lawful activities in  accordance with the terms of the Agreement. We will not make our final  decision until after the end of the 30-day comment period and will  fully consider all comments received during the comment period.      Dated: July 3, 2000. William F. Shake, Acting Deputy Regional Director, Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland,  Oregon. [FR Doc.  00 - 18182   Filed  7-19- 00 ; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310-55-P

The season is open statewide from August 18 through January 31, 2002, except during the week of deer gun hunting season.           The daily bag limit for squirrels, which includes fox squirrels, gray squirrels, and red squirrels, is four. Squirrels may be hunted from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset.           ""This should be a good year for Ohio squirrel hunters,"" said Mike Reynolds, ODNR Division of Wildlife squirrel project leader. ""Last fall's abundant crop of acorns, beechnuts and hickory nuts is a good indicator of squirrel populations for this season in most areas of the state.""           When acorns and assorted nut crops -- also referred to as mast crops - are plentiful, they provide squirrels with storable winter food and result in improved winter survival and better reproductive success for the animals. The mast crop index for last year was up nearly 25 percent over 1999.           Reynolds encourages all squirrel hunters to promptly field dress and cool harvested game. ""With the season starting in August there will be many days of high temperatures where hunters will want to quickly cool their harvest.""           Hunters can still use their 2000 hunting license through August 31, after which a 2001 hunting license is required.                                       -30-                            For Further Information Contact:           Vicki Mountz, ODNR Division of Wildlife           (614) 265-6393 or           Mike Reynolds, ODNR Division of Wildlife           (740) 664-2745"

Col. William Daniel of the West Virginia Division of          Natural Resources. Investigating conservation officer Robert Waybright          reports that Hoover was struck in the upper left abdomen with the path          of the shot going into his upper chest.         This is the first hunting          related incident reported in 2000. In 1999, 40 hunting related incidents          were reported, including 10 fatalities. Of those fatalities, three were          accidently self-inflicted, four were caused by heart attacks, two were          caused as a result of falling out of tree stands, and one is of unknown          cause.         The chances of being injured          or killed while hunting can be greatly reduced by taking a free hunter          education class, sponsored by the Law Enforcement Section of the Division          of Natural Resources and held across the state.

On October 16, 59-year old          Robert M. Pigott of Southington, Ohio received injuries to the right shoulder          and ribs when he fell out of a tree stand while bow hunting for deer in          the Pheasant Run area of Randolph County, according to investigating Conservation          Officer Rocky Spencer. He was reported in stable condition at a local          hospital soon after the incident.         On October 17, 41-year old          Curtis A. Naylor of Chloe, West Virginia, was injured in the left arm          when a loaded shotgun he was carrying on an all terrain vehicle (ATV)          discharged while he was returning home after hunting squirrel in the Walnut          area of Calhoun County. He was treated at Charleston Area Medical Center.          DNR Law Enforcement Sgt. Tom Fox reports charges may be filed pending          completion of an investigation.         On October 21, 58-year old          Aaron James Culver of Summersville died of an apparent heart attack while          turkey hunting in the Phillips Run area of Nicholas County, according          to Conservation Officer C.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), list the Santa  Barbara County Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment (DPS) of the  California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) as endangered  under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Of six  habitat complexes, consisting of 27 documented breeding sites and  associated uplands, five have suffered moderate to severe levels of  habitat destruction or degradation between 1996 and 2000. Plans to  convert additional sites from grazing to intensive agriculture are  being developed and implemented. We emergency listed the population  segment on January 19, 2000.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The California tiger salamander was first described as a distinct  species, Ambystoma californiense, by Gray in 1853 from specimens  collected in Monterey (Grinnell and Camp 1917). Storer (1925) and  Bishop (1943) likewise considered the California tiger salamander as a  distinct species. However, Dunn (1940), Gehlbach (1967), and Frost  (1985) considered the California tiger salamander a subspecies  (Ambystoma tigrinum californiense) that belonged within the A. tigrinum  complex. Based on recent morphological and genetic work, geographic  isolation, and ecological differences among the members of the A.  tigrinum complex, the California tiger salamander is considered to be a  distinct species (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Jones 1993; Shaffer and  McKnight 1996; Irschick and Shaffer 1997). The California tiger  salamander was recognized as a distinct species in the November 21,  1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804).     The California tiger salamander is a large, stocky, terrestrial  salamander with a broad, rounded snout. Adults may reach a total length  of 207 millimeters (mm) (8.2 inches (in)), with males generally  averaging about 200 mm (8 in) in total length and females averaging  about 170 mm (6.8 in) in total length. For both sexes, the average  snout--vent length is approximately 90 mm (3.6 in). The small eyes have  black irises and protrude from the head. Coloration consists of white  or pale yellow spots or bars on a black background on the back and  sides. The belly varies from almost uniform white or pale yellow to a  variegated pattern of white or pale yellow and black. Males can be  distinguished from females, especially during the breeding season, by  their swollen cloacae (a common chamber into which the intestinal,  urinary, and reproductive canals discharge), more developed tail fins,  and larger overall size (Stebbins 1962; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996).     California tiger salamanders are restricted to California, and  their range does not overlap with any other species of tiger salamander  (Stebbins 1985). Within California, the Santa Barbara County population  is separated by the Coast Ranges, particularly the La Panza and Sierra  Madre Ranges, and the Carrizo Plain from the closest other population,  which extends into the Temblor Range in eastern San Luis Obispo and  western Kern Counties (Shaffer et al. 1993).     The California tiger salamander inhabits low elevation, typically  below 427 meters (m) (1400 feet (ft)), vernal pools and seasonal ponds  and the associated grassland, oak savannah, and coastal scrub plant  communities of the Santa Maria, Los Alamos, and Santa Rita Valleys in  western Santa Barbara County (Shaffer et al. 1993; Sam Sweet,  University of California, Santa Barbara, in litt. 1993, 1998a, 2000a).  Although California tiger salamanders are adapted to natural vernal  pools, manmade or modified ephemeral and permanent pools are now  frequently used (Fisher and Shaffer 1996). California tiger salamanders  prefer open grassland to areas of continuous woody vegetation (Trenham  in revision). Although California tiger salamanders still exist across  most of their historic range in Santa Barbara County, the habitat  available to them has been reduced greatly. The ponds available to the  salamanders for breeding have been degraded and reduced in number and  the associated upland habitats inhabited by salamanders for most of  their life cycle have been degraded and reduced in area through changes  in agriculture practices, urbanization, building of roads and highways,  chemical applications, and overgrazing (S. Sweet in litt. 1993,  1998a,b; Gira et al. 1999; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development 2000).     The salamanders breeding in and living around a pool or seasonal  pond, or a local complex of pools or seasonal ponds, constitute a local  subpopulation. The rate of natural movement of salamanders among  subpopulations depends on the distance between the ponds or complexes  and on the intervening habitat (e.g., salamanders may move more quickly  through sparsely covered and more open grassland versus more densely  vegetated scrublands).     Subadult and adult California tiger salamanders spend much of their  lives in small mammal burrows found in the upland component of their  habitat, particularly those of ground squirrels and pocket gophers  (Loredo and Van Vuren 1996) at depths ranging from 20 centimeters (cm)  (7.9 in) to 1 m (3.3 ft) beneath the ground surface (Trenham in  revision). California tiger salamanders use both occupied and  unoccupied small mammal burrows but, since burrows collapse within 18  months if not maintained, an active population of burrowing mammals is  necessary to sustain sufficient underground refugia for the species  (Loredo et al. 1996). California tiger salamanders may remain active  underground into summer, moving small distances within burrow systems  (Trenham in revision). During estivation (a state of dormancy or  inactivity in response to hot, dry weather), California tiger  salamanders eat very little (Shaffer et al. 1993). Once fall and winter  rains begin, they emerge from these retreats on nights of high relative  humidity and during rains to feed and to migrate to the breeding ponds  (Stebbins 1985, 1989; Shaffer et al. 1993).     Adults may migrate long distances between summering and breeding  sites. The distance from breeding sites may depend on local topography  and  [[Page 57243]]  vegetation, the distribution of ground squirrel or other rodent  burrows, and climatic conditions (Stebbins 1989, Hunt 1998). In Santa  Barbara County, juvenile California tiger salamanders have been trapped  more than 360 m (1,200 ft) away while dispersing from their natal  (birth) pond (Ted Mullen, Science Applications International  Corporation (SAIC), personal communication, 1998), and adults have been  found along roads more than 2 km (1.2 mi) from breeding ponds (S. Sweet  in litt. 1998a). Although most marked salamanders have been recaptured  at the pond where they were initially captured, in one study  approximately 20 percent of California tiger salamanders hatched in one  pond traveled to ponds a minimum of 580 m (1900 ft) away to breed  (Trenham 1998; Trenham et al. in review). Non-dispersing California  tiger salamanders, however, tend to stay closer to breeding ponds; 95  percent of California tiger salamanders at a study site in Monterey  County probably stay within 173 m (568 ft) of the pond in which they  bred. Once established in underground burrows, California tiger  salamanders may move short distances within burrows or overland to  other burrows, generally during wet weather. Dispersal distance is  closely tied to precipitation; California tiger salamanders travel  further in years with more precipitation (Trenham in revision). As with  migration distances, the number of ponds used by an individual over its  lifetime will be dependent on landscape features.     Migration to breeding ponds is concentrated during a few rainy  nights early in the winter, with males migrating before females (Twitty  1941; Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996; Trenham 1998;  Trenham et al. 2000). Males usually remain in the ponds for an average  of 6 to 8 weeks, while females stay for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. In  dry years, both sexes may stay for shorter periods (Loredo and Van  Vuren 1996, Trenham 1998). In years where rainfall begins late in the  season, females may forego breeding altogether (Loredo and Van Vuren  1996, Trenham et al. 2000).     Female California tiger salamanders mate and lay their eggs singly  or in small groups (Twitty 1941; Shaffer et al. 1993). The number of  eggs laid by a single female ranges from approximately 400 to 1,300 per  breeding season (Trenham 1998). The eggs typically are attached to  vegetation near the edge of the breeding pond (Storer 1925, Twitty  1941), but in ponds with no or limited vegetation, they may be attached  to objects (rocks, boards, etc.) on the bottom (Jennings and Hayes  1994). After breeding, adults leave the pond and typically return to  small mammal burrows (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham in revision),  although they may continue to come out nightly for approximately the  next 2 weeks to feed (Shaffer et al. 1993).     Eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days with newly hatched larvae ranging from  11.5 to 14.2 mm (0.45 to 0.56 in) in total length. Larvae feed on  algae, small crustaceans, and mosquito larvae for about 6 weeks after  hatching, when they switch to larger prey (P.R. Anderson 1968). Larger  larvae will consume smaller tadpoles of Pacific treefrogs (Hyla  regilla), California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora), western toads  (Bufo boreas), and spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus hammondii), as well as  many aquatic insects and other aquatic invertebrates (J.D. Anderson  1968; P.R. Anderson 1968). The larvae also will eat each other under  certain conditions (H.B. Shaffer and S. Sweet cited in Paul Collins,  Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, in litt. 2000a). Captive  salamanders appear to locate food by vision and smell (J.D. Anderson  1968).     Amphibian larvae must grow to a critical minimum body size before  they can metamorphose (change into a different physical form) to the  terrestrial stage (Wilbur and Collins 1973). Feaver (1971) found that  California tiger salamander larvae metamorphosed and left the breeding  ponds 60 to 94 days after the eggs had been laid, with larvae  developing faster in smaller, more rapidly drying ponds. In general,  the longer the ponding duration, the larger the larvae and  metamorphosed juveniles are able to grow. The larger juvenile  amphibians grow, the more likely they are to survive and reproduce  (Semlitsch et al. 1988; Morey 1998).     In the late spring or early summer, before the ponds dry  completely, metamorphosed juveniles leave the ponds and enter small  mammal burrows after spending up to a few days in mud cracks or tunnels  in moist soil near the water (Zeiner et al. 1988; Shaffer et al. 1993;  Loredo et al. 1996). Like the adults, juveniles may emerge from these  retreats to feed during nights of high relative humidity (Storer 1925;  Shaffer et al. 1993) before settling in their selected estivation sites  for the dry summer months. Newly metamorphosed juveniles range in size  from 41 to 78 mm (1.6 to 3.1 in) snout-vent length (Trenham et al.  2000).     Many of the pools in which California tiger salamanders lay eggs do  not hold water long enough for successful metamorphosis. Generally, 10  weeks is required to allow sufficient time to metamorphose. The larvae  will desiccate (dry out and perish) if a site dries before larvae  complete metamorphosis (P.R. Anderson 1968, Feaver 1971). Pechmann et  al. (1989) found a strong positive correlation with ponding duration  and total number of metamorphosing juveniles in five salamander  species. In one study, successful metamorphosis of California tiger  salamanders occurred only in larger pools with longer ponding durations  (Feaver 1971), which is typical range-wide (Jennings and Hayes 1994).  Even though there is little difference in the number of pools used by  salamanders between wet and dry years, pool duration is the most  important factor to consider in relation to persistence and survival  (Feaver 1971; Shaffer et al. 1993; Seymour and Westphal 1994, 1995).     Lifetime reproductive success for other tiger salamanders is  typically low, with fewer than 30 metamorphic juveniles per breeding  female. Trenham et al. (2000) found even lower numbers for California  tiger salamanders, with roughly 12 lifetime metamorphic offspring per  breeding female. In part, this is due to the extended length of time it  takes for California tiger salamanders to reach sexual maturity; most  do not breed until 4 or 5 years of age. While individuals may survive  for more than 10 years, less than 50 percent breed more than once  (Trenham et al. 2000). Combined with low survivorship of metamorphs (in  some populations, less than 5 percent of marked juveniles survive to  become breeding adults (Trenham 1998)), reproductive output in most  years is not sufficient to maintain populations. This suggests that the  species requires occasional ``boom'' breeding events to prevent  extirpation (temporary or permanent loss of the species from a  particular habitat) or extinction (Trenham et al. 2000). With such low  recruitment, isolated subpopulations can decline greatly from unusual,  randomly occurring natural events as well as from human-caused factors  that reduce breeding success and individual survival. Factors that  repeatedly lower breeding success in isolated ponds that are too far  from other ponds for migrating individuals to replenish the population  can quickly drive a local population to extinction.  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment      The evidence supports recognition of Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamanders as a DPS for purposes of listing, as  defined in our February 7, 1996, Policy Regarding the Recognition of  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments (61 FR 4722). The definition of  ``species'' in section 3(16) of the Act  [[Page 57244]]  includes ``any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate  fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.'' When listing a  population under the Act as a DPS, three elements are considered--(1)  the discreteness of the population segment in relation to the remainder  of the species to which it belongs; (2) the significance of the  population segment to the species to which it belongs; and (3) the  population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's  standards for listing (i.e., is the population segment, when treated as  if it were a species, endangered or threatened?) (61 FR 4722).     The DPS of California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County is  discrete in relation to the remainder of the species as a whole. The  DPS is geographically isolated and separate from other California tiger  salamanders; no mixing of the population with other California tiger  salamander populations occurs. As detailed below, this finding is  supported by an evaluation of the species' genetic variability.     Genetic analyses of the California tiger salamander suggest that  levels of interchange among populations are very low, and that  populations or subpopulations are genetically isolated from one another  (Jones 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993). Allozyme variation (distinct types  of enzymes (proteins) in the cells, which are formed from an  individual's inherited genes) and mitochondrial DNA sequence data  indicate the existence of at least seven genetically distinct  California tiger salamander populations (Shaffer et al. 1993). Although  the allozyme variation reported by Shaffer et al. (1993) is quite low,  it does indicate patterns of geographic isolation. Probably because of  this isolation, the population in Santa Barbara County is one of the  two most genetically distinct, and these salamanders are more similar  to California tiger salamanders on the eastern side of the Central  Valley than to those in the closest populations found in the Temblor  Range (Shaffer et al. 1993). The populations in the Temblor Range are  about 67.5 km or 44 mi by air, from the Santa Barbara County  population, while the eastern Central Valley populations are 200 km or  128 mi by air, across mountain ranges, an arid plain, and the Central  Valley, all of which are inhospitable zones for California tiger  salamanders. The Santa Barbara County population may be a relict  population of a much more widespread group that extended across the  area where the Tehachapi and Transverse Ranges now extend. The uplift  of those ranges changed the terrain and the local climatic conditions,  isolating salamanders in what is now northwestern Santa Barbara County.  The Temblor Range salamanders appear to be a more recent extension from  the populations south of San Francisco Bay. Based upon what is probably  the largest genetic data set for a non-human vertebrate (H. Bradley  Shaffer, University of California, Davis (UCD), in litt. 2000a), the  sequence divergence between the Santa Barbara County tiger salamanders  and other samples from throughout the species' range is on the order of  1.7 to 1.8 percent (Shaffer et al. 1993; H.B. Shaffer in litt. 1998,  2000a). Shaffer's mitochondrial DNA sequence data (Shaffer and McKnight  1996, and unpublished data) suggest that the seven distinct populations  differ markedly in their genetic characteristics, with Santa Barbara  County tiger salamanders having gene sequences not found in any other  California tiger salamander populations (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 1998).  California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County may have been  separated from the other populations for about 1 to 1.5 million years  (Shaffer et al. 1993; Shaffer and McKnight 1996; H.B. Shaffer in litt.  1998). Shaffer et al. (1993) and Shaffer (in litt. 1998) suggest that  differentiation at this level is sufficient to justify species-level  recognition; Shaffer will probably describe Santa Barbara County tiger  salamanders as a distinct species when he and his colleagues submit  their results for publication (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 2000b).     The genetic differences between Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamanders and the remainder of the species as a whole are  accompanied by a morphological difference that is diagnostic for the  DPS. Individuals in Santa Barbara County have a distinct color pattern  consisting of a yellow band, rather than distinct spots, along the  lateral side of the animal, and a distinct yellow pattern on the  lateral margins of the belly (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 2000b; Scott  Stanley, American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York, in  litt. 2000; S. Sweet in litt. 2000a).     The Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander population is  biologically and ecologically significant to the species. As discussed  above, the Santa Barbara County population is genetically distinct from  other populations of California tiger salamanders, and individuals  exhibit genetic characteristics not found in other California tiger  salamanders. The Santa Barbara County population is also significant in  that it constitutes the only population of California tiger salamanders  west of the outer Coast Ranges, and it is the southernmost population  of the species. The DPS covered in this final rule is found only in  Santa Barbara County. The extinction of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander population would result in the loss of a  significant genetic entity, the curtailment of the range of the species  as a whole, and the loss of a top predator in the aquatic systems that  Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders inhabit. Based on  geographic isolation, the lack of evidence of gene flow with other  populations, and marked genetic differentiation, we conclude that the  Santa Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders meets  the discreteness and significance criteria in our Policy Regarding the  Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments and qualifies as   a DPS. We discuss the Santa Barbara County population's conservation  status below.  Status and Distribution      Currently, California tiger salamanders are found in six  metapopulations in Santa Barbara County. Collectively, salamanders in  these regions constitute a single genetic population or DPS,  reproductively separate from the rest of the California tiger  salamanders (Jones 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993; Shaffer and McKnight  1996). Ponds and associated uplands in southwestern (West Orcutt) and  southeastern (Bradley-Dominion) Santa Maria Valley, west Solomon Hills/ north Los Alamos Valley, east Los Alamos Valley, Purisima Hills and  Santa Rita Valley constitute the six discrete regions or  metapopulations where California tiger salamanders are documented in  Santa Barbara County (S. Sweet in litt. 1998a, 2000b; Monk & Associates  2000a). Ponds and upland habitats occupied by the California tiger  salamander on the crest of the Purisima Hills between the Los Alamos  and Santa Rita Valleys may provide a genetic link between these two  metapopulations (S. Sweet in litt. 2000b).     For the purposes of this rule, a metapopulation is defined as a  group of subpopulations or ``local populations'' linked by genetic  exchange. Of 14 breeding sites or subpopulations within this DPS  documented at the time of the emergency listing, 1 was destroyed in  1998, the upland habitat around 3 had been converted into more  intensive agriculture practices (i.e., vineyards, gladiolus fields, and  row crops) which may have eliminated the salamander subpopulations, 1  was surrounded by agriculture and urban development, 2 were affected by  overgrazing, 4 were  [[Page 57245]]  believed to be threatened with conversion to vineyards or other  intensive agriculture practices, and the remaining 3 were in areas  rapidly undergoing conversion to vineyards and row crops (Sweet et al.  1998; Sweet in litt. 1998a, b; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development 1998; Grace McLaughlin, Service, personal observations  1998). Since the publication of the emergency rule, nine breeding ponds  have been verified in two pool complexes previously designated as  potential breeding areas (Purisima Hills and eastern Los Alamos), and  four new ponds have been found in known complexes (S. Sweet in litt.  2000a, pers. comm. 2000a; Monk & Associates 2000a; Lawrence Hunt,  Biological Consultant, in litt. 2000). The ponds are all within 2  kilometers (km) (1.2 miles (mi)) of previously mapped known or  potential ponds. Of the new ponds and surrounding upland habitats, only  the Purisima Hills complex, with six ponds, is relatively free from  threats. Of the other seven ponds, three are threatened by vineyard  development (although discussions aimed at providing protection for the  California tiger salamander and its habitat are underway), one is  adjacent to an intensively farmed area near Highway 101 and two are  adjacent to roads; one of the latter is near a reservoir occupied by  bullfrogs. The seventh pond may not be large enough to sustain a viable  population of California tiger salamanders over the long term. A larger  nearby pond, only 76 m (250 ft) away, appears to have suitable habitat  but may not have had successful breeding for several years due to the  introduction of catfish by the previous owner (S. Sweet pers. comm.  2000a).     Additional breeding ponds could exist within each of the  metapopulations noted above, but searches in other areas with  apparently suitable habitat have not identified additional probable  habitat areas or subpopulations (Christopher 1996; John Storrer,  Biological Consultant, in litt. 1997, 1998a, b, c; P. Collins in litt.  1998, 2000b, pers. comm. 1999; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a, 2000b; L. Hunt  in litt. 2000; Monk & Associates 2000a). All of the known and potential  localities of the California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County  are largely on private lands, none are protected by signed and  implemented habitat conservation plans, and access is limited. Although  one habitat management plan, which was written before the listing at  the request of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) as mitigation for a  Clean Water Act violation, has been implemented recently, we do not  know if it will ensure the continued existence of the California tiger  salamanders population on that property. Discussions with several other  landowners show promise of developing agreements that will provide  sufficient high quality habitat for the long-term persistence of  California tiger salamanders on their lands.     Although historical evidence of California tiger salamanders from  San Luis Obispo County exists in the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural  History's vertebrate collection (Collins in litt. 2000a), no California  tiger salamanders have been found during more recent survey efforts in  appropriate habitat in southern San Luis Obispo County (Scott and  Harker 1998, California Army National Guard 2000, S. Sweet in litt.  2000a). Any California tiger salamanders found in southern San Luis  Obispo County would probably be part of the Santa Barbara County DPS,  although genetic testing would need to be conducted to verify this, in  the event that any are discovered.  Previous Federal Action      On September 18, 1985, we published the Vertebrate Notice of Review  (50 FR 37958), which included the California tiger salamander as a  category 2 candidate species for possible future listing as threatened  or endangered. Category 2 candidates were those taxa for which  information contained in our files indicated that listing may be  appropriate but for which additional data were needed to support a  listing proposal. The January 6, 1989, and November 21, 1991, Candidate  Notices of Review (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively) also  included the California tiger salamander as a category 2 candidate,  soliciting information on the status of the species. On February 21,  1992, we received a petition from Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer of the  University of California, Davis, to list the California tiger  salamander as an endangered species. We published a 90-day petition  finding on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), concluding that the  petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may  be warranted. On April 18, 1994, we published a 12-month petition  finding (59 FR 18353) that the listing of the California tiger  salamander was warranted but precluded by higher priority listing  actions. We elevated the species to category 1 status at that time,  which was reflected in the November 15, 1994, Notice of Candidate  Review (59 FR 58982). Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which  we had on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and  threats to support preparation of listing proposals. In a memorandum  dated November 3, 1994, from the acting Assistant Regional Director to  the Field Supervisor, the recycled 12-month finding on the petition and  a proposed rule to list the species under the Act were given a due date  of December 15, 1995. However, on April 10, 1995, Public Law 104-6  imposed a moratorium on listings and critical habitat designations and  rescinded $1.5 million from the listing program funding. The moratorium  was lifted and listing funding was restored through passage of the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act on April 26, 1996, following severe  funding constraints imposed by a number of continuing resolutions  between November 1995 and April 1996. The listing of the California  tiger salamander throughout its range was precluded by the need to  address higher priority species, although the status of the entire  species is currently under review.     On January 19, 2000, we published an emergency rule to list the  Santa Barbara County distinct population segment of the California  tiger salamander as endangered (65 FR 3096), concurrently with a  proposed rule (65 FR 3110) to list the species as endangered. Our  decision to emergency list this DPS of the California tiger salamander  was based on information contained in the original petition,  information referenced in the petition, and new information available  to us. We re-opened the comment period associated with the proposed  rule twice (65 FR 15887 and 65 FR 31869). We held a public hearing on  March 24, 2000.     The processing of this final rule conforms with our Listing  Priority Guidance published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1999  (64 FR 57114). The guidance clarifies the order in which we will  process rulemakings. Highest priority is processing emergency listing  rules for any species determined to face a significant and imminent  risk to its well-being (Priority 1). Second priority (Priority 2) is  processing final determinations on proposed additions to the lists of  endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Third priority is  processing new proposals to add species to the lists. The processing of  administrative petition findings (petitions  filed  under section 4 of  the Act) is the fourth priority. The processing of critical habitat  determinations (prudency and determinability decisions) and proposed or  final designations of critical habitat are no longer subject to  prioritization under the Listing Priority Guidance. This final rule is  a Priority 2 action and  [[Page 57246]]  is being completed in accordance with the current Listing Priority  Guidance. We have updated this rule to reflect new information  concerning changes in distribution, status, and threats since  publication of the emergency and proposed rules.  Summary of Comments and Responses      In the January 19, 2000, proposed rule (65 FR 3110), we requested  all interested parties to submit factual reports or information that  might contribute to development of a final rule. A 60-day comment  period closed on March 20, 2000. We contacted appropriate Federal  agencies, State agencies, county and city governments, scientific  organizations, and other interested parties and requested comments, and  notified affected landowners of the emergency listing. We submitted  public notices of the proposed rule, which invited general public  comment, to the Santa Maria Times and the Santa Barbara News-Press,  both in Santa Barbara County, on January 19, 2000. We requested peer  review in compliance with our policy, published in the Federal Register  on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270).     We received several requests for a public hearing and on March 24,  2000, we re-opened the public comment period (65 FR 15887) until May 4,  2000, to accommodate that hearing, which was held on April 20, 2000. On  May 19, 2000, we published an additional re-opening of the public  comment period (65 FR 31869), extending the comment period until June  5, 2000.     During the public comment period, we received written comments and  new information from 657 individuals, businesses and organizations,  with several commenters submitting comments during more than one  comment period. We received oral comments from 37 people at the public  hearing; 22 provided written comments also. In all, 231 commenters  opposed the listing, and 426 supported continued protection for the  DPS. Issues raised by the commenters, and our response to each, are  summarized below.     Issue 1: One commenter stated that additional research on the life  history and habitat needs of the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders is needed before making a decision to  list. Specifically, the commenter felt that we disregarded the  possibility of tiger salamanders using seasonal drainages as breeding  habitat.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree. None of the surveys and  research conducted on the Santa Barbara County population of California  tiger salamanders over the past 25 years have indicated that this  population has markedly different habitat requirements or life history  traits than other California tiger salamanders. While we did not  discuss the use of ponded areas within seasonal drainages as breeding  habitat, we do recognize that such use occurs in a limited number of  cases (about 2 to 10 percent across the entire range of the species  (Dwight Harvey, Service, Sacramento, California, in litt.)). Based on  aerial photographs going back to the 1930s, we recognized that the  ponds identified as Railroad and Pipeline are modifications of natural  features. The fact remains that the California tiger salamander is a  pond breeding, not stream breeding, species, and water must be  impounded, naturally or artificially, for a long enough period for  development from egg to metamorphosis to occur. In most of the small  seasonal streams in northern Santa Barbara County, flow rates are too  rapid and surface water duration is too short to allow tiger  salamanders to breed.     Issue 2: One commenter requested that we identify the range of  dates that a breeding pool must remain hydrated in order to qualify as  suitable California tiger salamander breeding habitat in Santa Barbara  County.     Our Response: The range of dates within which California tiger  salamanders breed varies from year to year depending on the timing and  amount of rainfall (see ``Background'' section). Therefore, we are  unable to provide specific dates within which a breeding pond must  remain hydrated. Also, researchers have found that female California  tiger salamanders will often forgo breeding in years with unusually  late rainfall. We do know that California tiger salamanders require a  minimum of 10 weeks to complete the transition from egg to  metamorphosed juvenile; larvae that have a longer time period before  metamorphosis are more likely to survive to adulthood and reproduce.     Issue 3: One commenter suggested that the salamanders may have  migrated to other areas as a result of habitat loss and degradation.     Our Response: We do not agree. We believe that most California  tiger salamanders in areas subject to habitat conversion are killed in  the process. Deep-ripping and repeated plowing of grazing or oil  production lands during conversion to vineyards and intensive cropping  destroys the burrows in which the salamanders spend most of their  lives. The mechanical actions kill burrow residents directly, or  unearth them, leaving them exposed to risks of being run over by  equipment, and death from dehydration or predation.     Issue 4: One commenter stated that the genetic data relied on were  insufficient, as all samples were taken from one pond, and none from  surrounding counties.     Our Response: While the data presented by Shaffer and McKnight  (1996) did incorporate samples from only one Santa Barbara County pond,  samples from three other counties were also included (Madera, Alameda,  and Solano). Clear differences were demonstrated among those four  sites. That paper also included data from 20 additional taxa (species,  subspecies, and populations) within the tiger salamander (Ambystoma  tigrinum) complex. Additional data cited in the emergency listing  (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Irschick and Shaffer 1997; Shaffer et al.  1993; Shaffer in litt. 1998; H.B. Shaffer's unpublished mitochondrial  DNA sequence data) incorporated data from 56 localities representing 12  populations, including 3 sites from the Santa Barbara population, 15  sites in Monterey County, 6 sites in San Benito County, and 5 sites  representing 1 population along the San Luis Obispo-Kern County line,  the latter two being the only counties with California tiger  salamanders that share borders with Santa Barbara County. Samples from  populations in 8 other counties (Yolo, Sonoma, Solano, Alameda,  Stanislaus, Fresno, Tulare, and Madera) were also examined. It is clear  from Dr. Shaffer's and his colleague's data that the Santa Barbara  County animals are genetically distinct from other California tiger  salamander populations, including those in ``surrounding'' counties.     We submitted the emergency rule and Dr. Shaffer's published and  unpublished material to four additional reviewers in addition to those  who provided comment on the distribution, status, threats, and ecology  of the California tiger salamander. We received comments from a fish  and reptile geneticists and from a bacterial geneticist. Both stated  that they believe we interpreted Dr. Shaffer's data correctly, and  applied it appropriately and in accordance with our policy on distinct  population segments.     Issue 5: One commenter stated that it is questionable whether the  reduction in habitat in one county poses a threat to the species as a  whole.     Our Response: We did not emergency list nor propose to list the  California tiger salamander across its range. We emergency listed and  proposed for continued protection only the Santa Barbara County  distinct population segment of the California tiger  [[Page 57247]]  salamander. The reasons for recognition of this DPS are in accordance  with our policy and guidelines and are explained in the emergency rule  and in this document. The best available scientific evidence supports  our conclusion that the Santa Barbara County population of California  tiger salamanders is discrete, is significant to the species as a  whole, and is in danger of extinction throughout most of its historic  range. We are currently reviewing the status of the entire species  across its remaining range.     Issue 6: Several commenters suggested that we used insufficient  scientific evidence or did not use the best scientific and commercial  data available in making our decision. Several commenters implied that,  in making our decision to emergency list the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander, we relied on ``anecdotal information,  speculation, and scientific studies of dubious validity'' or stated  that the information was ``based on questionable science.''     Our Response: We respectfully disagree. We used the scientific and  commercial information available to us during our status review process  and at the time of the listing to make our decision. We based our  decision on museum specimens and the accompanying collection data,  aerial photographs documenting the land use changes over the last 60  years, reports produced by the County Agricultural Commissioner's and  Planning and Development Department, articles published in peer- reviewed, professional scientific journals, and additional work  conducted by the authors of some of those articles.     We have received and sought out additional information during the  public comment periods and public hearings, requested appropriate  professional peer review as required under our policies, reviewed all  the information available to us, and presented that information in this  document. As documented in the emergency listing and this rule, we have  considerable evidence concerning the rates of land use changes and the  inadequacy of regulatory mechanisms to protect the salamander, and  extensive scientific evidence documenting the uniqueness of the Santa  Barbara population, risks to amphibian species from habitat loss and  fragmentation, disease, and predation by and competition from non- native species.     Issue 7: Several commenters stated that insufficient data has been  collected to estimate the size of the Santa Barbara County population  of California tiger salamanders or that we must know how many  California tiger salamanders existed ``before, how many now, and what  has affected their sustainability''; and believed we should have  surveyed all possible ponds and contacted all landowners before  emergency listing the population. One commenter implied that the loss  of habitat may not have led to a decrease in population size.     Our Response: We agree that we do not have an estimate of the size  of the Santa Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders.  Our decision to list this population is based on significant threats  associated with recent habitat loss and expectations of continued loss  and fragmentation of the remaining habitat, as detailed in the  Background, Status and Distribution, and Summary of Factors Affecting  the Species sections (see factor E discussion, in particular), and not  on absolute numbers of animals. It is not necessary to know how many  individuals existed before habitat loss and degradation, etc., began to  take their toll, nor is it necessary to know precise numbers of  existing individuals. Amphibian populations naturally undergo large  fluctuations in population size as a result of random natural events  such as drought and fires. The loss of crucial upland habitats and the  loss of individuals through agricultural and development activities can  leave small populations that are unable to withstand decreases in size  as a result of such events. Additional information on the effects of  habitat loss and fragmentation that became available after the  publication of the emergency rule has been incorporated into this final  rule.     In our 12-month petition finding, published April 18, 1994, we  concluded that we had sufficient information to warrant proposing the  listing of the species as a whole, but that the preparation of a  proposal was precluded by the need to complete higher priority actions.  That conclusion was based on information provided in the petition and  in our files. We published Candidate Notices of Review in 1996 (61 FR  7596), 1997 (62 FR 4938), and 1999 (64 FR 57534) that included the  California tiger salamander and requested the submission of additional  information on the status and distribution of the species. We have  carefully considered information relevant to the status of and threats  to the Santa Barbara County distinct population segment that became  available since our 1994 12-month petition finding. The decision to  move forward with an emergency listing for this population was based on  the rapid changes in the quantity and quality of the habitat available.     We have documented the factors that led to the rapid loss of  habitat and increases in threats to the Santa Barbara County  population. As our efforts and those of other agencies in working with  landowners had failed to stem the rapid rate of habitat loss, and the  existing regulatory mechanisms were inadequate to ensure protection for  the population and its habitats, we believe that immediate protection  under the Act was necessary to protect the remaining California tiger  salamanders in Santa Barbara County.     Issue 8: Several commenters stated that the California tiger  salamander is more widespread in Santa Barbara County than we presented  in the emergency rule, and stated that they had seen them in a variety  of places.     Our Response: Service and other biologists investigated many of  these sightings. None of the sightings were verified as California  tiger salamanders. We concluded that most of the sightings were of  arboreal (tree dwelling) salamanders, Aneides lugubris, a smaller,  purple-brown colored salamander with very tiny scattered yellow spots.  We will investigate two other cases, one in an area where non-native  tiger salamander larvae have been found, and one in area that appears  to have suitable California tiger salamander habitat, when  environmental conditions are appropriate.     Issue 9: Two commenters stated that there are more than 20 sites  available and in good condition for the California tiger salamander,  not 14 as stated in the rule. One commenter stated that the emergency  rule did not give adequate attention to additional potential sites that  could supply breeding habitat for California tiger salamanders.     Our Response: At the time of the publication of the emergency rule,  the California tiger salamander was known from 14 current and  historical sites in Santa Barbara County. We acknowledged in the  emergency rule that other potential breeding ponds or pond complexes  may exist, but could not be surveyed by local biologists due to access  restrictions from private landowners. The rule also stated that  possible California tiger salamander breeding ponds were probably  facing types and levels of threats similar to those documented for the  known ponds. Since the publication of the emergency rule, surveys have  found new ponds. These findings are discussed in this final rule. Our  assumption at the time of the emergency rule that most of the potential  ponds face threats (e.g., conversion to intensive agriculture, impacts  from roads and exotic species)  [[Page 57248]]  similar to those affecting the known ponds has been substantiated. Only  one metapopulation appears to be relatively free of significant threats  and may be protected through conservation easements.     Issue 10: One commenter questioned the viability of the Tanglewood  Complex as a breeding site, as this was based on a record from one  larval California tiger salamander.     Our Response: The discovery of a larval California tiger salamander  in the vicinity of the Tanglewood Complex suggested the presence of a  nearby breeding locality, as juvenile California tiger salamanders do  not move great distances when migrating from breeding ponds in the  fall. We agree that in the absence of actual breeding pond surveys on  the Tanglewood complex, it is conceivable that the larvae had not come  from that location, but rather some unknown nearby location. Since  publication of the emergency rule, a survey of the vernal ponds on the  Tanglewood property has confirmed a breeding population of California  tiger salamanders, as represented by multiple larvae captured onsite.  Additional ponds within 2 km (1.2 mi) of the Tanglewood ponds also have  breeding California tiger salamanders (see ``Background'' section).     Issue 11: One commenter suggested that, as there was no recent  petition specific to the Santa Barbara population of California tiger  salamanders, we have no legal basis for listing the population.     Our Response: Receipt of a petition to list a species is not  required in order for us to undertake a status review and develop a  proposal to list or an emergency rule. We have the independent  authority to undertake assessments and status reviews of species  considered as candidates for listing, and to list those species where  their protection under the Act is warranted. Dr. Shaffer's 1992  petition was not rejected, as the commenter claimed, but was found in  the 12-month petition finding to be ``warranted but precluded,''  meaning that there was enough information to support a listing, but  that there were higher priority listings to complete.     Issue 12: One commenter suggested that we list the Santa Barbara  County California tiger salamander as threatened, rather than  endangered, to give the Service the option of proceeding with a special  4(d) rule that would exempt from the prohibitions of section 9 of the  Act certain activities that would otherwise constitute take of  California tiger salamanders.     Our Response: The criteria for designating species as threatened or  endangered are outlined in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations  that we issued in (50 CFR part 424). Based upon information that we  have received regarding the status and distribution of the species, we  believe that the California tiger salamander is in danger of extinction  throughout all or a significant portion of its range in Santa Barbara  County, and therefore, fits the definition of endangered as defined in  the Act. This is discussed in detail in the ``Summary of Factors  Affecting the Species'' section.     Issue 13: One commenter suggested that in the absence of  information regarding specific threats to the distinct population  segment (e.g., overutilization, disease, predation), we should not have  based our decision ``solely on the conversion of native habitat. * *  *''     Our Response: Under section 4 of the Act and the regulations (50  CFR part 424) issued to implement the listing provisions of the Act, we  may determine a species to be endangered or threatened due to one or  more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The rates of  habitat degradation and loss in Santa Barbara County are sufficient to  warrant the listing of the Santa Barbara DPS. However, we did not base  our decision solely on the rate of conversion of habitat, but also on  the inadequacy of existing Federal, State, and local regulatory  mechanisms to protect the salamanders and their habitat, and the risks  faced by salamanders due to intensified agricultural activities,  urbanization, and habitat fragmentation. As the threat of habitat loss  is still present, and neither the regulatory mechanisms nor their  enforcement has changed since the emergency listing, both factors still  threaten the continued existence of the Santa Barbara DPS.     Issue 14: Several commenters stated or implied that the threats to  salamander habitat do not exist, the Service has portrayed the threats  inaccurately, the County has received no applications for projects to  eliminate breeding pools, and threats to the breeding pools would be  subject to the Clean Water Act, the Act, and the Santa Barbara County  Grading Ordinance.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree that we have portrayed the  threats inaccurately. We have documented the threats based on aerial  photography and site visits. We agree that projects or actions that  would eliminate breeding pools would be subject to review under the  Clean Water Act and the Santa Barbara County Grading Ordinance, but  specific consideration of impacts to California tiger salamander  habitat would not necessarily be required under these laws if the Santa  Barbara DPS is not a listed entity. In addition, a primary factor cited  in the emergency listing was the conversion of the upland habitats  surrounding the breeding ponds to environments that will not support  tiger salamanders, and the fact that the salamanders would be killed  during the deep-ripping processes in preparation for vineyard  installation and other land clearing activities. Activities in upland  habitats are not normally under Corps Clean Water Act jurisdiction.  Implementation of the County Grading Ordinance has not resulted in  adequate protection of the salamander's upland habitats.     Issue 15: One commenter stated that information provided by the  County was incorrect and biased and was intended to mislead the  Service.     Our Response: As the commenter did not cite specific references, we  believe he was referring to the location and status information in  Santa Barbara County Planning and Development (1998) and Sweet, Collins  and Hunt (1998). The information was compiled by recognized scientists  with knowledge of the species, its habitat, and the threats to its  continued existence. Determinations of known, potential, and other  possible ponds were made based on specimens housed in museums in Santa  Barbara County and elsewhere, U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps,  Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory maps, and aerial  photographs archived at the County of Santa Barbara Planning Division.  All of these sources are available to the general public, either  through public agencies or private commercial resources. We also used a  report prepared by Santa Barbara County Planning and Development  Department, the Agricultural Commissioner and the UC Cooperative  Extension (Gira et al. 1999), that provides information on agricultural  land use and trends in the county.     Issue 16: We received several comments that a potential range map,  that we released at the April 20, 2000, public hearing, constituted new  information as it increased the number of landowners affected by the  listing.     Our Response: Under the emergency rule and the proposed rule, all  California tiger salamanders within Santa Barbara County are protected,  whether they are found in the previously documented range or outside of  those areas. The emergency rule states that the known habitat for the  California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County is vernal pools and  seasonal ponds and the associated  [[Page 57249]]  coastal scrub, grassland, and oak savannah plant communities of the  Santa Maria, Los Alamos, and Santa Rita Valleys in western Santa  Barbara County. The map released by us indicated the distribution of  possible suitable habitat for the California tiger salamander in Santa  Barbara County and was based on the best information currently  available to us. The map was designed to assist landowners in  identifying where these areas are, and to provide guidelines as to the  areas most likely affected by the listing. The map does not alter the  obligations or responsibilities of Santa Barbara County landowners and  land managers with respect to the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders under the Act, under the emergency,  proposed, or final rules.     Issue 17: Several commenters believe that the Grading and Zoning  Ordinances are sufficient to protect the species; one provided  additional information in support of this belief.     Our Response: As detailed in the rule, we believe that the County  ordinances, the past implementation and enforcement of those ordinances  by County agencies, and the adherence to those ordinances by some  landowners were not sufficient to protect the salamander and its  habitat. This is further supported by the Santa Barbara County 1998-99  Grand Jury Report, released May 6, 1999, which found      ``The agricultural community * * * frequently proceeds with  grading or other agricultural conversions without permits. * * *  Members of the agricultural community choose to pay the fines and  suffer other consequences * * *'' (Pg. 9)      One commenter provided information on nine violations of County and  Federal laws, a letter from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) expressing concern over potential violations of the Clean Water  Act and asking for County assistance in reviewing those cases, two  letters to landowners requesting consultation with the County regarding  sensitive resources, and a memo to the Board of Supervisors regarding  enforcement of the Grading Ordinance. We believe the information  provided and additional information relevant to the cases under review  supports our conclusion that the existing regulatory mechanisms,  including their application and enforcement have been inadequate to  protect California tiger salamanders and their habitat in Santa Barbara  County. Adequate mechanisms, processes and enforcement, prevent illegal  actions from occurring in the first place. Once salamanders are killed  and their habitat is destroyed or severely degraded, the damage is  done, the loss of individuals and populations has occurred. It is very  difficult, as documented in the emergency and final rules, to  rehabilitate degraded habitat, particularly vernal pools and other  seasonal wetlands, when the hydrology has been altered by deep soil  disturbances.     Issue 18: Several commenters expressed the view that much of the  California tiger salamander's habitat is agricultural land that has  been in production since 1900 and suggested that if the salamander has  survived it shows how well farmers have taken care of the land.     Our Response: Although much of the acreage in Santa Barbara County  has been cultivated in the past, the scale and the nature of  agriculture has changed over time. Historically, land was dry farmed in  a patchwork, with fields laying fallow. This allowed California tiger  salamanders to persist over time, as they always had some upland areas  as refugia. However, as stated in our emergency rule and in this  document, intensive agriculture has increased greatly in Santa Barbara  County, and resulted in the permanent conversion of upland refugia to  land uses that are incompatible with the long-term persistence of  California tiger salamanders, including vineyards, intensive  agriculture, and urban development. The changes have included the  increased use of various chemicals that can have negative effects on  salamanders, as well as changes in crops and farming methods that are  not conducive to salamander survival.     Issue 19: Several commenters addressed the issue of roadkill,  assuming that the greatest impact is roadkill and that we have done  nothing to address that issue; another offered suggestions to reduce  roadkill. Commenters also stated that any impact from the conversion of  alleged habitat to crops is minimal at best compared to roadkill, that  no peer-reviewed study proves that farming and ranching is incompatible  with the protection of the species, and that we must eliminate losses  from roadkill before addressing losses from farming practices.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree with the comments, but  realize that we could have made our concerns more clear. The greatest  impact to California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County is not  roadkill, but the killing of all age classes of California tiger  salamanders in burrows when deep-ripping and other land-clearing  activities (such as conversion of grazing and oil production lands to  intensive cropping or housing developments) occur. The Twitty (1941)  and Launer and Fee (1996) citations in the emergency rule refer to  roadkills near ponds in northern California on Stanford University  property, and were provided as additional documentation of threats to  amphibians in general and California tiger salamanders specifically.  The only estimate of roadkill in Santa Barbara County is Sweet (in  litt. 1993), which states that an average of 40 percent of salamanders  seen on or along roads are dead. However, this does not mean that 40  percent of the mortality of California tiger salamander is due to  collisions with vehicles; the study did not investigate other sources  of mortality. Sweet's report concludes that ``the sizes of breeding  adults do not point toward a major influence by road-kill.'' (Emphasis  in original.) We have been working with CalTrans (beginning in May  1999) at one of the two sites of highest concern to undertake measures  to encourage California tiger salamanders to use alternate routes under  roads, to install more drains in berms so adults that do get on roads  have more options, and to prevent juveniles from getting up on roads in  the first place. Information on the rates of habitat loss and proximity  of breeding sites to roads are presented in the ``Status and  Distribution'' and ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''  sections.     The conclusions we have drawn as to the impact of farming and  overgrazing on California tiger salamanders are based upon what is  known about how specific activities are conducted, the likely physical  and chemical effects of those activities on the landscape, and the  likelihood that these effects on the landscape will in turn have an  impact on California tiger salamanders, given what we know about their  biology. For example, deep ripping of soil is very likely to kill any  salamanders in the layers of soil being ripped, including those inside  burrows, at other locations in the soil, or on the surface. Other  alterations of the salamander's habitat, such as road-building and  conversion to fields of seasonal crops and vineyards, can also kill  salamanders directly during conversions (see factor E, below).     Such alterations can dramatically change the physical and chemical  structure of the habitat through which salamanders migrate to breeding  ponds or upland habitat. When considered in light of the biology of  California tiger salamanders, these alterations of the environment  reduce the chances that salamanders will be able to traverse these  habitats successfully. For  [[Page 57250]]  example, changes in the moisture regimes, microlandscape, and ground  cover could require migrating salamanders to cross rapid runoff; expose  animals to toxic levels of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and  herbicides; interfere with the ability of salamanders to travel the  distances necessary to make it to the breeding pond or upland habitat  while rain or moisture conditions are suitable; or increase their  susceptibility to predators. We do not have data generated from studies  that demonstrate such effects unequivocally. We are basing these  conclusions on our interpretations of what we do know about these human  activities, the biology and life history of salamanders, and studies  that have documented the changes in species numbers and abundances as a  result of land use changes (see factor E discussion).     Issue 20: Several commenters expressed concern that all rodent  control operations would have to be halted, with devastating effects to  agricultural operations. Some stated that halting such programs would  also jeopardize those ponds that have been created or modified by  damming and berming, as the burrowing activities could cause failures  of those dams and berms.     Our Response: Not all methods of rodent control are expected to  have the same level of effects on California tiger salamander  populations. We have recommended to landowners that they avoid  destruction of burrows or the release of toxic chemicals, including  pesticides, into burrows of ground squirrels and gophers within 2 km  (1.2 mi) of breeding ponds. As stated in the emergency rule, ``Rodent  control programs must be analyzed and implemented carefully in  California tiger salamander habitat so the persistence of the  salamanders is not threatened.'' Appropriate methods and timing of  control efforts can be determined through the Act's section 10  incidental take permit process as habitat conservation plans (HCP) for  the salamanders are developed, evaluated once implemented, and revised  if necessary. Likewise, the impacts of burrowing rodents on dams and  berms, and methods to reduce those impacts, can be addressed in HCPs.     Issue 21: The reasons for the emergency determination were not  clearly demonstrated.     Our Response: We respectfully disagree. We believe that, in both  the emergency rule and this document, we have clearly presented and  documented the status and distribution of this distinct population  segment, the threats facing the remaining subpopulations, and the  imminency of those threats.     Issue 22: Several commenters stated that several landowners were in  the process of developing habitat conservation plans, of which the  Service was unaware or chose to ignore. Another commenter stated that  the Service should offer farmers and ranchers a proposal to create a  habitat conservation plan for the area, and that to use the threat of  regulation to forward this plan only ensures its failure.     Our Response: Although we did not discuss it in the emergency  listing, we were aware of conservation efforts by several landowners.  We met with one vineyard manager in the Fall of 1998 to try to ensure  sufficient protection of California tiger salamander habitat following  violations of the Clean Water Act. The management plan that was  developed after that meeting, without further Service input, may not,  in our opinion, ensure protection for the salamander and its habitat  that is adequate to ensure the survival of the population in  perpetuity. In another case the Service has provided funds to assist  other agencies and landowners in developing conservation plans,  including the purchase of conservation easements. To date, no final  agreements have been reached.     We cannot defer or avoid listing a species that is at risk of  extinction on the basis of intentions to develop conservation  agreements or plans. We cannot assume that such plans will be developed  and implemented, or that they will be successful in providing long-term  protection.     A habitat conservation plan is a document required when applying  for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act. Incidental take permits are required when activities will result  in ``take'' of threatened or endangered species. While Service  personnel provide detailed guidance and technical assistance throughout  the process, the development of an HCP is driven by the applicant. The  purpose of the habitat conservation plan is to ensure that the effects  of incidental take authorized under the permit will be adequately  minimized and mitigated.     Issue 23: Several commentors suggested that we should be focusing  on public, not private lands to conserve the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders, and that we should move  salamanders onto government property. One commenter stated that  landowners have offered to set up preserves on their land.     Our Response: One purpose of the Act (section 2(b)) is to provide a  means to protect the ecosystems upon which threatened and endangered  species depend. Although species introductions may be a potentially  important recovery tool, they are less effective when they occur in  habitat that has not been occupied by the species in the past.  Vandenberg Air Force Base, the closest government property near the  range of the California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County, has  been surveyed extensively for tiger salamanders; to date, tiger  salamanders have not been found there. Similarly, tiger salamanders  have not been found on Los Padres National Forest. This may be due to  differences in soil types and microclimate conditions, or it may be an  historical artifact of where California tiger salamanders were able to  disperse. Transplanting California tiger salamanders to lands where  they do not occur naturally would do nothing to protect the ecosystems  in which they evolved and are found, and probably would not be  successful. Therefore, the need to list the species would not be  precluded. We must address all causes of losses and threats to the  population, including those that occur on private lands.     Issue 24: One commenter states that the 2 km (1.2 mi) home range  reported in the emergency listing is too generous an estimate of how  far California tiger salamanders will actually migrate from breeding  ponds to summer retreat habitat. The commenter believes that it is more  important that the Service focus on (1) preserving the watersheds that  support California tiger salamander breeding ponds and, (2) ensuring  that adequate rodent populations occur within these watersheds so as to  provide adequate summer retreat habitat for particular California tiger  salamander breeding ponds.     Our Response: California tiger salamanders have been known to  travel 2 km (1.2 mi) or more from their breeding pond. We agree that 2  km overestimates the distance that most California tiger salamanders  are likely to travel from breeding ponds. As stated in the emergency  rule and this document, the distance traveled from breeding sites  depends on many site-specific factors, such as topography and  vegetation, the distribution of ground squirrel or other rodent  burrows, and climatic conditions. Although the likelihood of  encountering these salamanders tends to decrease with distance from  their breeding pond, we cannot provide a firm distance beyond which  there is no risk. No studies have been undertaken in Santa Barbara  County to determine how far California tiger salamanders disperse from  breeding ponds. The  [[Page 57251]]  colonization of a newly created pond in the Los Alamos Valley from a  pond approximately 227 m (750 ft) away suggests that California tiger  salamander regularly move large distances. Additionally, a 5 year study  at the Hastings preserve in Monterey found that a large portion (20  percent) of California tiger salamanders traveled to ponds that were  580 m (1900 ft) away (see the Background section).     We agree that preserving the watersheds supporting California tiger  salamander breeding ponds and maintaining adequate rodent populations  to supply refugia for salamanders is more important than establishing a  fixed boundary beyond which salamanders are likely to be found. It is  possible, in some cases, that a 2 km (1.2 mi) distance would not  incorporate all of the watershed, or that lands beyond that distance  should be evaluated as dispersal habitat. The exact configuration of  habitat necessary to protect the salamanders will be site-specific.     Issue 25: Some commenters believe farmers have helped salamanders  by building dams which prolonged optimum conditions for the  salamanders, giving the larvae the maximum opportunity to grow large  and healthy before completing metamorphosis.     Our Response: The enlarging of existing natural ponds or the  creation of new ponds within a grazing-dominated landscape may have  been beneficial to the California tiger salamander in many cases.  However, the creation and maintenance of permanent or nearly permanent  bodies of water within intensely cropped areas or vineyards has not  been documented as providing suitable habitat for tiger salamanders. In  many cases, California tiger salamanders are no longer found in ponds  within such systems (Shaffer et al. 1993). Management of such ponds for  agricultural uses, such as drawing down the ponds for frost protection,  which is likely to occur when California tiger salamander larvae are  present, can be in conflict with the needs of the salamanders.  Permanent ponds also provide breeding habitat for exotic fish and frogs  that can prey on and compete with California tiger salamanders.     Issue 26: Many commenters stated that the Service should compensate  private landowners for the loss of revenue that occurs when California  tiger salamanders are found on their land. Another reminded us that the  ``taking'' of land is unconstitutional without compensation.     Our Response: Listing under the Act does not imply that private  land would be ``locked up'' without the ability for reasonable use.  Recovery planning for this species may include recommendations for land  acquisition or easements involving private landowners. These efforts  would be undertaken with the cooperation of the landowners. We do work  with landowners to identify activities and modifications to activities  that will not result in take, to develop measures to minimize the  potential for take, and to provide authorizations for take through  section 7 and 10 of the Act. We encourage landowners to work in  partnership with us to develop plans that ensure land uses can be  carried out in a manner consistent with the conservation of listed  species.     Issue 27: Several commenters stated that we should take the  potential economic impacts of the listing into account in our decision- making process. One commenter stated that we must take into account the  economic impact of identifying any particular area as critical habitat.     Our Response: Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, we must base a  listing decision solely on the best scientific and commercial data  available. The legislative history of this provision clearly states the  intent of Congress to ``ensure'' that listing decisions are ``* * *  based solely on biological criteria and to prevent nonbiological  criteria from affecting such decisions * * *'' H.R. Rep. No. 97-835,  97th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1982). As further stated in the legislative  history, ``* * * economic considerations have no relevance to  determinations regarding the status of species * * *'' Id. at 20.  Because we are specifically precluded from considering economic  impacts, either positive or negative, in a final decision on a proposed  listing, we did not consider the economic impacts of listing the Santa  Barbara County population of the California tiger salamander.     We agree that we must take into account the economic impact of  identifying a particular area as critical habitat. We have not proposed  or designated critical habitat for the California tiger salamander. If  the decision is made to designate critical habitat for the Santa  Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander, we will publish  a proposed rule and a draft economic analysis of the proposed  designation, and accept public comments on both. Following the receipt  of public comments, we will complete the economic analysis of the  impact of the critical habitat designation and then publish a final  rule.     Issue 28: Several commenters believe that the issuance of permits  by the Service serves to unfairly restrict the number of people allowed  to conduct surveys and habitat assessments and thus limits public input  and avoids peer review.     Our Response: The Service does not require permits for conducting  habitat assessments and thus does not limit the number of people able  to conduct surveys for suitable habitat or to provide us with  information regarding habitat quality. However, in order to properly  assess the validity and reliability of such reports and information, it  is incumbent on us to examine the qualifications of people submitting  the reports and information. Relative to the issuance of recovery  permits under Section 10 of the Act, which allow sampling for larvae  and adults in suitable habitat, the law requires us to review all  applications for such permits to ensure that only those people with  appropriate training and experience conduct activities that will  actually ``take'' a salamander (e.g., netting, trapping, hand capture,  harassing). This requirement reduces the risks to the animals, and  promotes the conservation and recovery of the species.  Peer Review      In accordance with our July 1, 1994, Interagency Cooperative Policy  for Peer Review in Endangered Species Act Activities (59 FR 34270), we  solicited review from eight experts in the fields of ecology,  conservation, genetics, taxonomy and management. The purpose of such a  review is to ensure that listing decisions are based on scientifically  sound data, assumptions, and analyses, including input from appropriate  experts. Six reviewers sent us letters during the public comment  periods supporting the listing of the Santa Barbara County DPS of the  California tiger salamander. Several provided additional documentation  on the distribution of and threats to the salamanders; one provided  additional genetic data. Their information has been incorporated, as  appropriate. Two reviewers specifically evaluated the genetic data on  which the determination of the DPS was made; both stated that the data  clearly and strongly supported our interpretations and decision.  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      After a thorough review and consideration of all information  available, we have determined that the Santa Barbara County population  of the California tiger salamander warrants classification as an  endangered species.  [[Page 57252]]  We followed procedures found at section 4 of the Act and regulations  (50 CFR Part 424) issued to implement the listing provisions of the  Act. We may determine a species to be endangered or threatened due to  one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These  factors and their application to the Santa Barbara County DPS of the  California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) are as follows:  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of Its Habitat or Range      California tiger salamanders now occur in scattered subpopulations  within six isolated areas or metapopulations across the species'  historic range in Santa Barbara County. Based on the topography and  habitat type of the lands that have been converted to agriculture and  urban development, we conclude that the number of breeding ponds, the  extent of upland habitats, and the quality of the remaining habitats  have been reduced greatly since Europeans first settled the region.  While those areas remained in grazing lands or oil production, which  generally have relatively low effects on the subpopulations, the  species was relatively secure. However, based on aerial photography  from the 1930s through the year 2000 (archived at the Santa Barbara  County Planning and Development Department), the conversion to  intensive agriculture and urban developments has resulted in the loss  of breeding habitat from the destruction or alteration of natural  vernal pools and seasonal ponds, and the loss of upland habitat used  for estivation and migration.     Pools and ponds are destroyed when they are filled during grading  and leveling operations or deep-ripping. Deep-ripping or deep slip  plowing is a technique that uses a 4- to 7-foot deep plow to break up  the hardpan (layer of dense soil or material that prevents water  percolation) or compacted soil to allow water to drain deeper into the  soil and prevent water retention or ponding. Alternatively, seasonal  ponds may be converted to irrigation ponds, which are often managed in  ways that are not conducive to salamander survival (L. Hunt in litt.  1998). The repeated plowing and discing or deep-ripping of upland  habitats can alter the hydrology of the pools, thus destroying them  (Coe 1988), and can kill salamanders outright and destroy the small  mammal burrow systems in which they live most of the year.     Intensive agricultural practices began in the Santa Maria River and  San Antonio Creek Valleys more than 130 years ago (Elihu Gevirtz, Santa  Barbara County Planning and Development Department, pers. comm. 1999),  probably eliminating many breeding ponds and associated upland  habitats. The increasingly rapid conversion of these lands and those in  the Los Alamos and Santa Rita Valleys to intensive agricultural  practices is characterized by the increase, through 1997, in row crop  acreage by more than 9,900 hectares (ha) (more than 25,000 acres (ac))  since 1986 and the installation of approximately 4,000 ha (10,000 ac)  of vineyards from 1996 to 1999, more than doubling the acreage planted  to grapes (Gira et al. 1999). This is further supported by the fact  that, since 1992, irrigated cropland in Santa Barbara County has  increased by approximately 15,700 ha (38,850 ac) to a total of 47,700  hectares (118,270 acres), or a 49 percent increase; approximately 5,670  ha (14,000 ac), or 36 percent of the growth, occurred from 1997 through  1999 (Santa Barbara County Planning and Development Department 2000).  We noted in the emergency rule that these conversions have resulted in  the destruction of two breeding ponds (one suspected and one  documented) and the grading of 90 and 100 percent of their drainage  basins, and the grading of 50 to 100 percent of the drainage basins of  five documented and two suspected breeding ponds in the last 5 years  (Santa Barbara County Planning and Development Department 1998). Of the  ponds discovered since the emergency rule, a substantial portion of the  adjacent upland habitat of at least one has been graded in the past  year (B. Fahey, pers. obs. 2000; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development Department aerial photography collection). There are  proposals to develop vineyards around 7 other documented breeding ponds  in 2 complexes, but we are involved in discussions with the landowners  and managers to provide for the protection of the California tiger  salamander and its habitat (Hunt 1998; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998,  2000; Santa Barbara County Planning and Development 1998; Sweet et al.  1998; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a,b, 2000b; Monk & Associates 2000a). The  threats from agriculture, urbanization, overgrazing, fragmentation, and  roadkill are severe in four metapopulations, moderate in one, and  minimal in the sixth. The current and potential threats are discussed  below by region (West Orcutt, Bradley-Dominion, North Los Alamos, East  Los Alamos, Purisima Hills, and Santa Rita).     The five known breeding sites in southwestern Santa Maria Valley  (west of Highway 101 and Santa Maria), comprising the West Orcutt  metapopulation, are on grazing and other agricultural lands. Vernal  pools in the area have been lost or adversely affected by rapid  development in the Santa Maria Valley (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999).  Thirty years ago, a housing development directly affected one breeding  site in this metapopulation; California tiger salamanders have been  reported from water meter vaults at residences within this development  (L. Hunt in litt. 2000). Ongoing agriculture within the vernal pool  complex can have negative effects on the hydrology, expose salamanders  to contaminants, and kill terrestrial phase salamanders outright. Two  sites are subject to mortality from roadkill due to their proximity to  roads: One is by the heavily-traveled Black Road and the other is near  a dirt road subject to yearly grading. Two remaining breeding ponds are  separated from each other by a railroad that may disrupt migration  routes and reduce genetic interchange. These sites are also threatened  by overgrazing, as evidenced by terracing of the hillsides and a lack  of vegetative cover (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998; Jones and Stokes  Associates, Inc., no date) (see discussion on grazing in Factors C and  E, below).     Before 1996, the four documented and three possible breeding sites  (Sweet et al. 1998) in southeastern Santa Maria Valley, which  constitute the Bradley-Dominion metapopulation, were surrounded by oil  production and grazing lands. This is probably the most at-risk  metapopulation, due to agricultural intensification. Since 1996,  agricultural land conversion for vineyards, vegetable row crops, and  flowers has destroyed one documented and one suspected breeding site,  possibly extirpated salamanders from two other documented sites and one  possible breeding site, and threatens the remaining possible breeding  site (S. Sweet in litt. 1993; 1998a,b). Although California tiger  salamanders were found migrating across roads in the vicinity of the  possible breeding sites throughout the 1980s, salamanders have not been  observed since the early 1990s, when the grazing lands were converted  to vineyards (S. Sweet in litt. 1998a). One documented breeding site  may not have held water long enough in 2000 to support successful  breeding (Bridget Fahey, Service, pers. obs. 2000), and although  surveys of two other breeding sites were not conducted, the uplands  surrounding one pond have been converted to intensive agriculture (S.  Sweet in litt. 1998a,b; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998, 2000). It is  likely that  [[Page 57253]]  the adult breeding population at that site has been greatly reduced.     A storage facility for agricultural products is within the  watershed of the remaining documented breeding site (S. Sweet in litt.  1998a; Theresa Stevens, Santa Barbara County Planning and Development,  pers. comm. 1999). Precautions have been taken to reduce the threats of  runoff and spills into the natural pond (Analise Merlo, Santa Barbara  County Planning and Development, pers. comm. 1999) that could make the  habitat less suitable for salamanders during the breeding or  development seasons. A road between this pond and a nearby pond, the  watershed of which was converted to gladiolus fields in 1998, disrupts  migration between the ponds and the uplands, has caused the deaths of  many salamanders, and contributes to potentially lethal contamination  of the ponds (S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a).     The North Los Alamos Valley or Las Flores metapopulation, although  fragmented by Highway 101, was considered to be an important breeding  site for the species provided existing conditions could be maintained  (Stebbins 1989). However, recent changes in land ownership and  management have resulted in the conversion from grazing lands to  vineyards east of the highway. The direct effects of this conversion  resulted in the loss of one vernal pool and the severe degradation of  upland habitats surrounding that pool and another documented breeding  site (Hunt 1998). California tiger salamanders were not found during a  survey of the remaining pond in March 2000 (Walter Sadinski, Service,  pers. obs. 2000), although they were present in other ponds in the  metapopulation at that time (Monk & Associates 2000b). Additional  surveys and monitoring will be needed to determine if adult California  tiger salamanders are still present in the vicinity of the pool and if  the remaining upland habitat around the pond is sufficient to support a  California tiger salamander population. We still have concerns that  habitat around seven vernal pools and seasonal ponds on the west side  of Highway 101 that are documented breeding sites may be converted from  grazing lands to intensive agriculture (Santa Barbara County Planning  and Development Department 1998; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a; L. Hunt in  litt. 1999; Abe Lieder, Santa Barbara County Planning and Development  Department, in litt. 1999; Morgan Wehtje, California Department of Fish  and Game (CDFG), pers. comm. 1999), but we are involved in discussions  with landowners and managers regarding protections for the salamander  and its habitat. One of these ponds is in danger of being completely  filled in by siltation due to increased soil erosion from the vineyard  on the east side of the highway (P. Collins in litt. 2000a; Jeanette  Sainz, landowner, pers. comm. to B. Fahey 2000). Half of the uplands  adjacent to a recently-discovered California tiger salamander breeding  pond were converted to intensive agriculture in the fall of 1999,  probably killing many of the adult salamanders in the uplands  associated with that pond (P. Collins in litt. 2000a; B. Fahey and G.  McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000). Continued farming of that area will  likely result in further losses.     The recently discovered Purisima Hills metapopulation, consisting  of six small ponds and surrounding upland habitats on the crest of the  Purisima Hills, is in an area previously identified as probable  California tiger salamander habitat (Sweet et al. 1998). The ponds are  probably satellites to the larger Laguna Seca pond, a reported although  unconfirmed California tiger salamander breeding site (S. Sweet in  litt. 2000b). Salamanders from this metapopulation may provide evidence  of an historic genetic link between the Los Alamos and Santa Rita  Valley metapopulations, although the intensive agriculture currently  along State Highway 135 in the Los Alamos Valley probably now  constitutes a barrier to gene flow. This metapopulation is the least  threatened of the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander  metapopulations; the owner of the property has expressed interest in  working with the Land Trust of Santa Barbara County to establish  conservation easements protecting both the California tiger salamanders  and open land on the site (Van de Kamp 2000). The land use around these  ponds consists of cattle grazing.     The east Los Alamos metapopulation consists of three small ponds in  an open savannah grassland (Monk & Associates 2000a). Currently, the  property is used for cattle grazing (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000);  however, the site is proposed for vineyard installation (Tony Korman  and Susan Cagann, Kendall Jackson, pers. comm. 2000). The property is  bordered to the north by Highway 101, which, along with extensive  vineyards, probably serves as a barrier between this site and some  potential breeding ponds on the north side of the highway.     In the Santa Rita Valley metapopulation, the westernmost area  occupied by the California tiger salamander has been severely affected  by agricultural grading, conversion to row crops, and livestock  facilities (S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a,b; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs.  1998, 2000; Service files). A site in the eastern part of the valley  has two vernal pools that have been deepened to create a permanent  water source for cattle and have had introductions of mosquitofish  (Gambusia affinis) and sunfish (Lepomis spp.). Bullfrogs also are at  the site (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000). The upland habitat to the  north of the pools is still in very good condition. The pools are  adjacent to Highway 246, resulting in considerable road mortality of  salamanders during their breeding migrations (S. Sweet in litt. 1993,  1998a). Efforts to reduce roadkill are under discussion. Upland  habitats around two possible breeding ponds northeast of the second  site were deep-ripped in 1998 in preparation for conversion to  vineyards (L. Hunt in litt. 1998; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development Department 1998). Vineyards have been installed (G.  McLaughlin pers. obs. 1999, 2000), and one of the ponds was enlarged  and deepened in 1999 (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999; Jim Mace, U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, pers. comm. 1999). This change may make the pond  less desirable for the California tiger salamander and more likely to  be inhabited by exotic fish, crayfish, and bullfrogs. The remaining  undisturbed habitat is probably insufficient to support California  tiger salamanders over the long term.     Oil production began within the range of the salamander  approximately 100 years ago, with the discovery of oil in the Solomon  Hills (within the range of the Los Alamos tiger salamander  metapopulation). By 1910, production had begun in the Santa Maria  Valley (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999). Although oil production is less  disruptive to the upland habitats than agriculture, oil sump ponds,  particularly those located where natural ponds and pools once existed,  may act as toxic sinks. While attracting salamanders seeking breeding  sites, these ponds may contain levels of contaminants that may kill  adults, eggs, and larvae outright, or cause deformities in the  developing larvae thus precluding their survival (see discussion on  contaminants in Factor E of this section).     The primary cause of the reduced distribution of the California  tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County is the conversion of native  habitat to intensive agricultural practices and urban development. In  addition, the largest remaining subpopulations are in areas most  severely threatened by human encroachment (Shaffer et al. 1993; S.  Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a; E. Gevirtz in litt. 1998). Besides direct  loss  [[Page 57254]]  of habitat, the widespread conversion of land to agricultural and  residential uses has led to the fragmentation of the range of the tiger  salamander and isolation of remaining subpopulations in Santa Barbara  County (Shaffer et al. 1993; S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998a). Even  relatively minor habitat modifications, such as construction of roads,  pipelines, fences, and berms that traverse the area between breeding  and refuge sites, can increase habitat fragmentation, impede or prevent  breeding migrations, and result in direct and indirect mortality (Mader  1984; S. Sweet in litt. 1993, 1998; Findlay and Houlahan 1996; Launer  and Fee 1996; Gibbs 1998).  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      Although tiger salamanders have been used for bait and imported  larvae (``waterdogs'') are still sold in California, we have no  information indicating that California tiger salamanders are used for  this purpose (see discussion under Factor E of this section).  Therefore, we do not believe overutilization is a threat to the Santa  Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders.  C. Disease or Predation  Disease     The direct effect of disease on the Santa Barbara County population  of California tiger salamanders is not known and the risks to the DPS  have not been determined. Because California tiger salamanders are  found in so few sites in Santa Barbara County, and because the sites  are found across a relatively small area, disease must be considered a  potential threat to the persistence of the DPS. Sam Sweet (pers. comm.  1998) reported that one landowner in the Los Alamos Valley has seen  large numbers of dead and dying salamanders in a pond, but the cause  was not determined. Several pathogenic (disease-causing) agents,  including at least one bacterium (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), a water  mold (fungus) (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997; Lefcort et al. 1997), and  a virus (McLean 1998), have been associated with die-offs of closely  related tiger salamanders, as well as other amphibian species. Each of  these pathogens could devastate one or all of the remaining  subpopulations or metapopulations if introduced into Santa Barbara  County.     Worthylake and Hovingh (1989) reported on repeated die-offs of  tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Desolation Lake in the  Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Affected salamanders had red, swollen hind  legs and vents, and widespread hemorrhage of the skin and internal  organs. The researchers determined that the die-offs were due to  infection with the bacterium Acinetobacter. The number of bacteria in  the lake increased with increasing nitrogen levels as the lake dried.  The nitrogen was believed to come from both atmospheric deposition and  waste from sheep grazing in the watershed (Worthylake and Hovingh  1989). Acinetobacter spp. are common in soil and animal feces.  Overstocking of livestock in pond watersheds could lead to high levels  of nitrogen in ponds and contribute to increased bacterial levels.     Lefcort et al. (1997), in Georgia, found that tiger salamanders  raised in natural and artificial ponds contaminated with silt were  susceptible to infection by the water mold Saprolegnia parasitica. The  fungus first appeared on the feet, then spread to the entire leg. All  infected animals died. Die-offs of western toads (Bufo boreas),  Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae), and Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla)  also have been associated with Saprolegnia infections (Kiesecker and  Blaustein 1997). Saprolegnia spp. are widespread in natural waters and  commonly grow on dead organic material (Wise 1995).     High nitrogen and silt levels from overgrazing or other  agricultural or urban runoff may increase susceptibility to disease and  may interact with other risk factors (e.g., habitat loss, introduced  species) to jeopardize the persistence of a local population. Two of  the three ponds in the West Orcutt metapopulation area are in  overgrazed grasslands and are at risk of receiving runoff that has both  high nitrogen and high silt levels. Four ponds in the Los Alamos  metapopulation and the two ponds in the Santa Rita metapopulation are  on grazing lands; although the levels of grazing are not excessive,  silt and nitrogen levels must be considered when assessing the health  of these populations. One of the ponds in the Los Alamos Valley was the  site of a die-off of California tiger salamanders, but the cause was  unknown (S. Sweet pers. comm. 1998).     In addition to the Acinetobacter discussed above, an iridovirus  (viruses with DNA as the genetic material that occur in insects, fish,  and amphibians and may cause death, skin lesions, or no symptoms) has  been identified by the U.S. Geological Service (USGS), National  Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, as the cause of deaths of  large numbers of tiger salamanders at Desolation Lake, Utah. Infected  salamanders moved slowly in circles and had trouble remaining upright.  They had red spots and swollen areas on the skin. Viruses associated  with die-offs of tiger and spotted salamanders in two other States,  Maine and North Dakota, have been isolated (McLean 1998). In 1995,  researchers reported similar die-offs attributed to an iridovirus in  southern Arizona and near Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (McLean 1998).  Iridoviruses are found in both fish and frogs and may have been  introduced to some sites through fish stocking programs. Little is  known about the historical distribution of iridoviruses in salamander  populations. A virus could enter California via bait shops where  eastern tiger salamanders are legally sold in certain counties  (California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 14, Division 1, Subdivision  1, Chapter 2, Article 3, Sec. 4, 1999), or where they are illegally  sold in other areas. The virus may be carried by birds, such as herons  and egrets, that feed on the salamanders. Such a virus could be  devastating to the Santa Barbara County population of California tiger  salamanders. Predation     Predation and competition by introduced or nonnative species  potentially affect at least four of the six Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander metapopulations. Shaffer et al. (1993)  consider bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), mosquitofish, and other  introduced fish to be biological indicators of ponds that have been  disturbed to a degree that California tiger salamanders are excluded.  Competition is discussed under Factor E of this section.     Bullfrogs prey on California tiger salamander larvae (P.R. Anderson  1968). Morey and Guinn (1992) documented a shift in amphibian community  composition at a vernal pool complex, with California tiger salamanders  becoming proportionally less abundant as bullfrogs increased. Although  bullfrogs are unable to establish permanent breeding populations in  unaltered vernal pools and seasonal ponds, dispersing immature frogs  take up residence in vernal pools during winter and spring (Morey and  Guinn 1992) and may prey on native amphibians, including larval  California tiger salamanders. Lawler et al. (1999) found that less than  5 percent of California red-legged frog tadpoles survived to  metamorphosis when raised with bullfrog tadpoles (initially, ponds held  720 red-legged frog tadpoles and 50 bullfrog tadpoles; approximately 50  percent of the bullfrogs successfully metamorphosed). Due to the  documented effects of bullfrogs on other  [[Page 57255]]  amphibian species, we believe that they are likely to have similar  effects on California tiger salamanders and that the presence of  bullfrogs in salamander habitat threatens the persistence of the  salamander populations. Bullfrogs are found within 1.6 km (1 mi) of one  vernal pool complex in Santa Barbara County (S. Sweet pers. comm.  1999), and within two other pond complexes (L. Hunt in litt. 2000; G.  McLaughlin, pers. obs. 2000), posing threats to those three  metapopulations.     Mosquitofish, instead of pesticides, often are placed into ponds by  vector control agencies to eliminate mosquitoes. Mosquitofish are used  by every vector control district in the State and in some districts  represent the majority of their control efforts (Ken Boyce, California  Mosquito and Vector Control Association, in litt. 1994). These fish  were first introduced to California in 1922 and have since become well- established throughout the State's water systems (K. Boyce in litt.  1994). In general, mosquitofish are stocked in very small numbers  because they quickly reproduce to the maximum population levels that a  particular habitat may sustain. Mosquitofish are extremely tolerant of  polluted water with low levels of dissolved oxygen and have an  extremely wide range of temperature tolerance (Boyce 1994).  Mosquitofish prey on the California newt (Taricha torosa) (Gamradt and  Kats 1996) and Pacific treefrog (Goodsell and Kats 1999) larvae in both  field and laboratory experiments, even given the optional prey of  mosquito larvae (Goodsell and Kats 1999; Lee Kats, Pepperdine  University, pers. comm. 1999). Both newt and Pacific treefrog larvae  were found in stomachs of wild-caught mosquitofish (Goodsell and Kats  1999; L. Kats, pers. comm. 1999). Robert Stebbins observed mosquitofish  ingesting and then spitting out California newt larvae, causing severe  damage to the newts in the process (Graf 1993). Schmieder and Nauman  (1993) found that mosquitofish significantly affected the survival of  both prefeeding and large larvae of California red-legged frogs. Lawler  et al. (1999) did not find a reduction in survival rates of California  red-legged frog tadpoles raised in the presence of mosquitofish versus  controls with no mosquitofish, but those tadpoles that did survive  weighed less than control tadpoles and metamorphosed later, and most  were injured by the fish. Smaller size at metamorphosis may reduce  survival to breeding age and reproductive potential (Semlitsch et al.  1988; Morey 1998). Salamanders may be especially vulnerable to  mosquitofish predation due to their fluttering external gills, which  may attract these visual predators (Graf 1993). Loredo-Prendeville et  al. (1994) found no California tiger salamanders in ponds with  mosquitofish. Due to the documented effects of mosquitofish on other  amphibian species, we believe that they are likely to have similar  effects on California tiger salamanders and that the use of  mosquitofish in salamander habitat threatens the persistence of the  salamander populations.     In addition to mosquitofish, other introduced fish, both native and  non-native, threaten the California tiger salamander. The introduction  of bass and sunfish to many ponds that may have been breeding habitat  for California tiger salamanders has probably eliminated salamanders  from those sites. The distribution of the California tiger salamander  in the north Los Alamos metapopulation may be limited by catfish  (Ictalurus sp.) that were introduced several years ago into a pond that  appears to have suitable breeding habitat. Although a pond less than 76  m (250 ft) away appears less suitable for breeding, it is occupied by  California tiger salamanders (S. Sweet in litt. 2000b). If the  reproductive output from the smaller pond is not enough to sustain the  population and the fish are not removed, that breeding population could  be lost. Two other ponds in the north Los Alamos metapopulation had  bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus  salmoides), and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in 1999 (P.  Collins in litt. 2000a). The introduced fish populations were  extirpated when the ponds dried in the fall, but they may have caused  the loss of most or all of the larvae produced that year. A number of  ponds in or near occupied California tiger salamander habitat in the  West Orcutt area have been home to introduced fish for 20 years (Brady  Daniels, Kiewitt Pacific, pers. comm. 2000), probably eliminating any  California tiger salamanders that may have bred there.     Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarki) also apparently  prey on California tiger salamanders (Shaffer et al. 1993) and may have  eliminated some populations (Jennings and Hayes 1994). The crayfish  prey on California newt eggs and larvae, in spite of toxins that the  species has developed, and may be a significant factor in the loss of  newts from several streams in southern California (Gamradt and Kats  1996). These crayfish are found in two salamander breeding sites in  Santa Barbara County, but their effect on egg and larval survival is  unknown (S. Sweet pers. comm. 1999).     California tiger salamander larvae also are preyed upon by many  native species. In healthy salamander populations such predation is  probably not a significant threat, but when combined with other  impacts, such as predation by nonnative species, contaminants, or  habitat alteration, it may cause a significant decrease in population  viability. Native predators include great blue herons (Ardea herodias)  and egrets (Casmerodius albus), western pond turtles (Clemmys  marmorata), various garter snakes (Thamnophis species.), larger  California tiger salamander larvae, larger spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus  hammondii) larvae, and California red-legged frogs (Mike Peters,  Service, in. litt. 1993; Hansen and Tremper 1993).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The primary cause of the decline of the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders is the loss, degradation,  and fragmentation of habitat from human activities. Federal, State, and  local laws have not been sufficient to prevent past and ongoing losses  of California tiger salamander habitat. Federal     Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (Corps) to issue individual or general permits for  the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United  States, which include perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams,  wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other seasonal ponds typically used  by breeding salamanders. Projects that involve only the excavation of  pools whereby the discharge is limited to ``incidental fallback'' of  fill material, and projects that alter the watershed and hydrological  regime of the pool but do not involve ``discharge'' into the pool do  not require a section 404 permit (Coe 1988). General permits include  both nationwide and regional permits and may allow projects to proceed  without the scrutiny afforded through the individual permitting  process.     Of particular concern relative to the persistence of California  tiger salamanders are activities conducted under Nationwide Permits  (NWP) (33 CFR part 330 Appendix A). Previously, NWP 26 covered fill of  wetlands up to 3 acres; as of March 9, 2000, new NWPs 39, 41, 42, and  43, and modifications to NWPs 3, 7, 12, 14, 27, and 40 replace NWP 26  (65 FR 12817). The new and modified NWPs authorize many of the  [[Page 57256]]  same activities that NWP 26 authorized, but are activity-specific. The  maximum acreage limits of most of the new and modified NWPs is 0.2 ha  (0.5 ac). Most of the new and modified NWPs require notification to the  District Engineer for activities that result in the loss of greater  than 0.04 ha (0.1 ac). These permits thus authorize less fill than the  previous NWP 26. Under several of the NWPs that authorize activities  that might impact California tiger salamanders, the filling of less  than 0.04 ha (0.1 ac) of isolated waters can be undertaken without  notifying the Corps of the proposed activity unless a listed species or  designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity of  the project (NWP General Condition 11). However, the determination of  the potential presence of and/or impacts to listed species or  designated critical habitat is left to the applicant, who may not have  sufficient expertise to make such a determination.     Under several NWPs, if the activity will affect between 0.04 and  0.2 ha (0.1 and 0.5 ac) of wetlands, an applicant is required to notify  the Corps, but the Corps is not required to notify resource agencies  unless the project may affect a listed species or designated critical  habitat. Because vernal pools are often small and scattered across the  landscape, projects, even very large development projects that fill  hundreds of vernal pools, can be authorized under NWPs. Numerous small  projects in a given area also could be authorized, cumulatively  resulting in the loss of significant amounts of wetland and associated  upland habitats, with significant negative effects on local and  regional biodiversity (Semlitsch and Brodie 1998).     Projects affecting more than 0.2 ha (0.5 ac) of isolated waters  also can be authorized under NWPs after the Corps circulates a pre- construction notification (PCN) to the Service and other resource  agencies for review and comments. For such projects, the Corps can  place special conditions requiring minimization of impacts and/or  compensatory mitigation on authorizations granted under NWPs. The Corps  must require an individual permit for these projects if it determines  the project will have more than minimal individual or cumulative  effects. However, the Corps generally is reluctant to withhold  authorization under NWPs unless a listed threatened or endangered  species is known to be present. Also, the Corps often confines its  evaluation of impacts to those areas under its jurisdiction (i.e.,  wetlands and other waters of the United States). One review of  ambystomatid salamander studies reported that 100 percent of post- breeding adults and newly metamorphosed juveniles were found outside  the federally delineated wetland boundary (Semlitsch 1998). Therefore,  existing federal regulations are inadequate to protect tiger  salamanders, as impacts to uplands and mitigation for upland habitat  losses usually are not addressed by the Corps. Preservation of existing  pools without protection of large blocks of suitable uplands is  unlikely to result in the persistence of viable salamander populations  because the salamanders require both aquatic and upland habitats during  their life cycle. Thus, even with the new limits on filling of  wetlands, section 404 is unlikely to provide sufficient protection of  small isolated wetlands and the surrounding watersheds.     An individual permit is required for projects that do not qualify  under the terms of a General Permit, and for projects that are  determined by the Corps to have greater than minimal impacts or to be  contrary to the public interest. Individual permits are subject to  review by the Service, other resource agencies, and the public. When we  review the permit, we may recommend measures to avoid, minimize, or  mitigate losses. In some cases, compensatory mitigation (e.g., the  creation of artificial wetlands) is incorporated in the Corps permit as  a Special Condition. However, problems associated with such  compensatory measures often decrease or eliminate the habitat value for  salamanders at the sites (DeWeese 1994).     The creation of artificial wetlands and ponds as breeding habitat  for tiger salamanders has been used as a compensatory mechanism for the  loss of natural wetlands and pools. However, the long-term viability  and suitability of artificially created wetlands has not been  established. In 1994, the Service completed a report evaluating 30  wetland creation projects authorized through the Corps of Engineers  section 404 program (DeWeese 1994). Twenty-two projects ranged in age  from three to five years old, and eight projects were greater than five  years old at the time of the study. We found that, although it appeared  our goal of ``no net loss of acreage'' was being met or exceeded, the  value of the habitat created, which included the local wildlife species  that would be expected to use the habitat, was low. This was especially  the case for vernal pools and seasonal wetlands that had a value of  only 20 and 40 percent (respectively) of what existed previously.  Particular problems were noted for these habitat types, which often  were inundated (flooded) for longer than natural systems or more  frequently. The study concluded that, of the 600 ac (243 ha) of  proposed mitigation, half were meeting less than 75 percent of the  mitigation conditions. Mitigation and compensation for impacts to  larger wetlands under section 404 have failed to reduce threats to  California tiger salamanders.     The conversion of grazing land to intensive agricultural uses that  may adversely affect the California tiger salamander generally is  unregulated at any level of government. For example, the Corps has  promulgated regulations that exempt some farming, forestry, and  maintenance activities from the regulatory requirements of section 404  (33 CFR 323.4). Therefore, not all activities that destroy or degrade  vernal pools require Corps authorization. Certain normal farming  activities, including discing and plowing to depths less than 16 in (41  cm), can degrade or destroy vernal pools without requiring a permit  because these activities are exempt under the Clean Water Act. However,  deep-ripping, which disrupts the water-retaining hardpan that underlies  vernal pools and other seasonal wetlands, of lands formerly used for  ranching (i.e., grazing) or dry-land farming (e.g., non-irrigated hay  production) represents a ``change in use'' of the lands and is not  considered a normal and ongoing farming activity. As such, the practice  triggers section 404(f)(2) of the CWA, and requires review by and a  permit from the Corps (R.H. Wayland III, EPA, and D.R. Burns, Corps, in  litt. 1996). However, as discussed previously, the Corps typically  asserts jurisdiction only over the actual wetlands, not over the  surrounding uplands. State     The State of California recognizes the California tiger salamander  as a species of special concern under the California Endangered Species  Act (CESA), and has placed this species on the list of protected  amphibians, which means that it may not be taken without a special  (i.e., scientific collecting) permit (CRC, Title 14, Section 41).  However, this protection applies only to actual possession or  intentional killing of individual animals, and affords no protection to  habitat. Activities that destroy habitat and kill salamanders in the  process are not regulated.     The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) offers some  opportunities to protect rare, threatened and endangered plants and  animals and declares that it is the policy of the State to ``(p)revent  the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man's activities,  ensure  [[Page 57257]]  that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self-perpetuating  levels, and preserve for future generations representations of all  plant and animal communities.'' (California Public Resources Code,  section 21001(c) 1999). Species do not have to be listed under the  Federal or California ESAs to meet the determination of rare  (California Code of Regulations (CRC), Title 14, Chapter 3, Section  15380(b)(2)). Species that have been classified as ``species of special  concern'' are considered rare for the purposes of CEQA. When the CEQA  process is triggered, it requires full disclosure of the potential  environmental impacts of proposed projects. However, the CEQA review  process is not triggered unless issuance of a permit associated with a  project is considered ``discretionary'' rather than ``ministerial.''  The public agency with primary authority or jurisdiction over the  project is designated as the lead agency and is responsible for  conducting a review of the project and consulting with the other  agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. Section  15065 of the CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of significance if a  project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict the range  of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Once significant effects are  identified, the lead agency has the option to require mitigation for  effects through changes in the projects or to decide that overriding  social or economic considerations make mitigation infeasible. In the  latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant  environmental damage, such as destruction of rare species. Protection  of listed or rare species through CEQA depends, first, on whether  discretionary approval is required for a project and, second, where  such approval is required, on how the agency exercises its discretion.  The effectiveness of this statute in protecting California tiger  salamanders and their vernal pool and upland habitats has not been  consistent. Local     In Santa Barbara County, no specific regulatory protection exists  for vernal pools, surrounding uplands, and their associated species,  including California tiger salamanders. Some provisions are  discretionary and could provide some measure of protection. For  example, the Santa Barbara County Grading Ordinance (Ordinance 3937,  Chapter 14 of the County Code) states that the issuance of a grading  permit is discretionary (Section 14-6(a)), and that ``no person shall  cause or allow a significant environmental impact to occur as a result  of new grading as defined herein, including grading that is otherwise  exempt from these regulations.'' In one case in 1998, the Planning  Department required, after the fact, a permit, the preparation of an  environmental impact report, and mitigation for the discing of a vernal  pool and the deep-ripping of uplands associated with that and an  adjacent, larger pool in preparation for vineyard installation (Albert  J. McCurdy, Deputy Director, Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development, in litt. 1998a). Those requirements were overturned by the  County Board of Supervisors (A. McCurdy in litt. 1998b). The Corps did  require a small set-aside of approximately 5.7 ha (14 ac) to provide a  narrow buffer around both ponds, as mitigation for the discing of the  smaller pool (David Castanon, Army Corps of Engineers, in litt. 1999).  In another case, grazing lands surrounding another pool were converted  to row crops to the edge of the pool. Although discing and other  activities clearly degraded the wetland, no agency has required any  review, permits, or mitigation for the activities. Santa Barbara County  is developing new regulations to address the protection of various  components of California tiger salamander habitat, but those have not  been completed, nor do we know how effectively those regulations will  be implemented and enforced (John Patton, Santa Barbara County Planning  and Development, in litt. 2000).     A recent report on the status of agricultural grading and the  enforcement of the County's grading ordinance found that 93 percent of  the new cultivation since 1997 in Santa Barbara County has taken place  without the need for County permits (Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development Department 2000). This same report states that ``overall,  the County's enforcement of the Grading Ordinance appears to have had  little negative direct effect on the agricultural industry * * *'' and  that ``the program has not succeeded in encouraging operators of  agricultural expansion projects to consult with the agricultural  assistance team on whether permits are required prior to beginning  grading.'' Finally, a Grand Jury report published in 1999 states that  the Santa Barbara County agricultural community frequently proceeds  with agricultural conversions without a permit, preferring to suffer  the consequences later rather than undertake the time-consuming permit  process (Santa Barbara County Grand Jury 1999).     Typically, California tiger salamander habitat has been eliminated  without offsetting mitigation measures. Most mitigation plans that have  been required were designed specifically for vernal pool plants and did  not consider the upland habitats, including mammal burrows, needed by  salamanders, or their dispersal needs. As indicated above, the  artificial creation of vernal pools and seasonal wetlands as  compensatory mitigation has not been proven scientifically to be  successful over the long term (Zedler and Black 1988, Ferren and  Gevirtz 1990, Zedler and Calloway 1999). Race and Fonseca (1996)  reviewed numerous published and unpublished documents, which  collectively analyzed more than 2,000 permitted wetland mitigation  projects, and concluded that significant wetland losses will continue  unless compliance with existing regulations and permits is improved,  more habitat is generated, and more fully functioning wetlands are  created.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence      Several other factors, including habitat fragmentation,  contaminants, hybridization with and competition from introduced  species, and effects from oil production and over-grazing may have  negative effects on California tiger salamanders and their aquatic and  upland habitats. Fragmentation     Amphibian populations are prone to local extinction due to human- caused fragmentation (Findlay and Houlahan 1996, Gibbs 1998). This risk  is heightened for the California tiger salamander, as it is distributed  throughout the landscape in a metapopulation framework, with  salamanders at some sites temporarily extirpated and then recolonizing  from neighboring sites. Reducing the California tiger salamander's  distribution to a few isolated ponds greatly reduces the species'  ability to persist over time (H.B. Shaffer in litt. 2000b). The primary  factors that cause habitat fragmentation are road construction,  urbanization, and intensive agriculture (Mader 1984; Saunders et al.  1991). All documented localities of California tiger salamanders in  Santa Barbara County are affected by railroads, highways, or other  roads that have caused extensive fragmentation of the landscape. Even  the relatively pristine Purisima Hills ponds are either bounded by or  very close to a dirt road (S. Sweet in litt. 2000b). The dispersal and  migration distances of California tiger salamanders require a large  amount of barrier-free landscape (Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo et al.  1996). Large roads and highways represent permanent physical obstacles  and can block  [[Page 57258]]  California tiger salamanders from moving to new breeding habitat or  prevent them from returning to their breeding ponds or estivation  sites. Roads can accelerate fragmentation by increasing mortality and  preventing recolonization of sites that would otherwise be only  temporarily extirpated (Trombulak and Frissell 2000).     Road construction can significantly reduce the breeding population  of a pond and, in some cases, cause the loss of a large portion of a  metapopulation. Road construction results in the death of slow-moving  animals and causes soil compaction underneath and adjacent to the road  bed (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Any California tiger salamanders in  underground burrows in the path of the road or in the impact area are  likely to be crushed during road construction. Once the road is open to  traffic, salamanders are at risk of being run over on their first  dispersal migration from the pond, and on future migrations to and from  the ponds for breeding.     Two Santa Barbara County tiger salamander breeding ponds are within  0.4 km (0.2 mi) of a railroad that runs between them, possibly reducing  migration and genetic interchange between the ponds. In addition to the  barriers created by fill deposited in small canyons and watercourses,  the railroad tracks themselves can act as barriers to migrating  salamanders (Thomas R. Jones, Museum of Zoology, University of  Michigan, in litt. 1993). The animals have difficulty getting under the  tracks unless adequate holes are present.     All of the remaining breeding sites in Santa Barbara County are  near roads of various sizes. Eight are within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of a  major U.S. highway, one is bounded by a State highway, two are adjacent  to secondary roads (as was the pond destroyed in 1998), and five are  within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of secondary roads. Although the remaining ponds  are adjacent to or near dirt roads (Sweet et al. 1998a; Service files),  the threats to those ponds from roadkill and the effects of  fragmentation are less than the threats to ponds bounded by or near  heavily traveled paved roads. Findlay and Houlahan (1996) found that  roads within 2 km (1.2 mi) of wetlands adversely affected the number of  amphibian species in the wetlands. Roads alter many of the physical  characteristics of the environment that may be important to California  tiger salamanders, including soil density, soil water content, dust,  surface-water flow, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation (Trombulak  and Frissell 2000). The deleterious effects of roads on many ecological  factors reach an average of 0.6 km (0.4 mi) from the road itself and  are especially harmful to species such as salamanders that are often  genetically programmed to migrate in a certain direction for breeding  (Forman and Deblinger 2000).     Amphibians are especially vulnerable to being killed on roads due  to life histories involving migration between breeding and upland  habitats and their slow movements (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Large  numbers of California tiger salamanders, up to 9 to 12 per km (15 to 20  per mi) of road (Joe Medeiros, Sierra College, pers. comm. 1993), are  killed as they cross the roads on breeding migrations (Hansen and  Tremper 1993; S. Sweet in litt. 1993). Of California tiger salamanders  found on roads, 25 to 72 percent are dead (Twitty 1941; S. Sweet in  litt. 1993; Launer and Fee 1996). However, Sweet's report states that  ``the sizes of breeding adults do not point toward a major influence by  road-kill.'' (Emphasis in original.) Curbs and berms as low as 9 to 12  cm (3.5 to 5 in), which allow salamanders to climb onto the road but  can restrict or prevent their movements off the roads, are of  particular concern, as they effectively turn the roads into death traps  (Launer and Fee 1996; S. Sweet in litt. 1998a). Such berms exist on the  State highway and the secondary road adjacent to three ponds in Santa  Barbara County.     Although few currently used breeding ponds are within 0.5 km (0.3  mi) of urban developments, the rapid expansion of Santa Maria and  nearby communities will continue to fragment the remaining habitat. The  urbanization of the Santa Maria River and Orcutt Creek Valleys divided  what was probably a large, relatively contiguous tiger salamander  population extending from the Casmalia Hills in the west to Fulger  Point in the east into isolated subpopulations (West Orcutt and  Bradley-Dominion) that are no longer capable of genetic interchange.  One pond in the West Orcutt area is adjacent to an urban development,  the owner of the other two ponds in that area has expressed a desire to  develop his property (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999), and home sites are  offered in the Bradley-Dominion area (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998,  2000). Contaminants     Hydrocarbon and other contamination from oil production and road  runoff; the application of numerous chemicals for agricultural  production, roadside maintenance, and urban/suburban landscape  maintenance; and rodent and vector control programs may all have  negative effects on tiger salamander populations, as detailed below.     Direct mortality is not the only risk factor associated with roads,  as oil and other contaminants in runoff have been detected in adjacent  ponds and linked to die-offs of and deformities in California tiger  salamanders and spadefoot toads and die-offs of invertebrates that form  most of both species' prey base (S. Sweet in litt. 1993). Lefcort et  al. (1997) found that oil had limited direct effects on 5-week-old  marbled (Ambystoma opacum) and eastern tiger salamanders (A.t.  tigrinum), but that salamanders from oil-contaminated natural ponds  metamorphosed earlier at smaller sizes and those from oil-contaminated  artificial ponds had slower growth rates than larvae raised in non- contaminated ponds. Their studies did not address effects on eggs and  early larval stages, where the effects may be more pronounced. Hatch  and Burton (1998) and Monson et al. (1999) investigated the effects of  one component of petroleum products and urban runoff (fluoranthene, a  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) on spotted salamanders (A. maculatum),  northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), and African clawed frogs  (Xenopus laevis). In laboratory and outdoor experiments, using levels  of the contaminant comparable to those found in service station and  other urban runoff, the researchers found reduced survival and growth  abnormalities in all species and that the effects were worse when the  larvae were exposed to the contaminant under natural levels of  sunlight, rather than in the laboratory under artificial light.     Sedimentation from road construction, maintenance, and runoff is  another form of contamination that may affect California tiger  salamander breeding ponds. Roads alter the hydrology of slopes, in part  by diverting water into surface-water systems that can cause erosion,  create gullies, and deposit increased loads of sediments into wetland  systems (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Road traffic can spread dust,  which can settle into ponds, affecting aquatic and emergent vegetation  and causing asphyxiation of eggs. Increased sedimentation could also  degrade habitat by filling pools otherwise usable by the species; there  is evidence that this is occurring at one pond in the Solomon Hills/ west Los Alamos metapopulation (P. Collins in litt. 2000a, J. Sainz  pers. comm. to B. Fahey 2000). The ability of the California tiger  salamander to detect aquatic food items could be impaired from  increased sedimentation, as can  [[Page 57259]]  susceptibility to diseases (see factor C, above). Agricultural Contaminants     Even though most of the crop lands in California have been in  agricultural production since 1900, the application and associated  effects of large amounts of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and  nitrogen fertilizers on the landscape have been addressed only recently  (Burow et al. 1998a, b). The concentrations of these chemicals and  their immediate effects on various species have been difficult to  assess mainly due to lack of water sample data and lack of samples  close to the sources of application where the effects on wildlife are  most severe. In 1986-87 and from 1993 to 1997, USGS and California  Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) personnel sampled well and  ground water at 156 locations throughout the range of the California  tiger salamander (CDPR 1998; Burow et al. 1998a, b). From these  samples, 29 different chemicals potentially toxic to amphibians in  general and California tiger salamanders specifically were detected.     In Santa Barbara County, more than 1 million kilograms (kg) (2.2  million pounds (lb)) of agricultural chemicals were used in 1994 on  strawberries, grapes, lettuce, broccoli, and carrots, which were the  five major crop types grown on or near tiger salamander sites at that  time (California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Internet  Website). These chemicals included metam-sodium, methyl bromide, maneb,  fosetyl-aluminum, acephate, cryolite, chlorpyrifos, fenamiphos,  malathion, and endosulfan; some of these are extremely toxic to aquatic  organisms, including amphibians and the organisms on which they prey.  Many more agricultural chemicals may have lethal or sublethal effects  on California tiger salamanders; those discussed here provide only a  sample of the actual and potential threats.     Metam-sodium, a broad spectrum carbamate used for soil  sterilization, was one of the main chemicals applied on broccoli and  lettuce grown in 1994, when more than 114,000 kg (more than 250,000 lb)  were used in Santa Barbara County (CDFA). Metam-sodium is extremely  toxic to fish (Meister 1997). Although no test data are available for  amphibians, the effects are likely to be similar.     Chlorpyrifos is a highly toxic organophosphate insecticide applied  as granules, wettable powder, dustable powder, or emulsifiable  concentrate (EXTOXNET 1996a). Chlorpyrifos was detected at a  concentration of 0.006 micrograms/liter ( g/l) in domestic well  water close to vineyards at one location (Burow et al. 1998a); however,  animals migrating across recently treated fields may be exposed to much  higher concentrations. The compound is absorbed through the skin of  mammals (EXTOXNET 1996a); amphibians, with their more permeable skins,  absorb the chemical even more readily. General agricultural use of  chlorpyrifos is considered to pose a serious threat to wildlife  (EXTOXNET 1996a). More than 6,000 kg (13,000 lb) were used in Santa  Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Fenamiphos, a phosphorothioate, is used on many crops to control a  wide variety of nematodes (roundworms). The compound is absorbed by  roots and translocated throughout the plant. The toxicity of fenamiphos  to aquatic species varies from moderate to high. Fish are extremely  sensitive to fenamiphos (EXTOXNET 1996b). Fenamiphos has been linked to  fish and bird kills and is known to have a high potential of leaching  into the groundwater. Nearly 12,000 kg (26,000 pounds) were used in  Santa Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Malathion has caused effects such as mortality, delays in  metamorphosis, and decreased size at metamorphosis in several species  of frogs and toads at concentrations as low as 0.2 milligrams (mg/l)  (Devillers and Exbrayat 1992). Malathion was detected at concentrations  up to 0.1  g/l in test wells near fields on which it has been  used (Burow 1998a). More than 3,500 kg (7,800 lb) of malathion were  used in Santa Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Although test data for amphibian species could not be found, methyl  bromide is extremely toxic and is used to kill weeds, insects,  nematodes, and rodents (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). Methyl bromide is  used primarily on strawberries in Santa Barbara County, which are grown  extensively in the eastern Santa Maria Valley (Bradley-Dominion  metapopulation). More than 225,000 kg (500,000 lb) were used in Santa  Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     Azinphos-methyl (AZM) is an organophosphate insecticide and  miticide used on many crops. The EPA (EXTOXNET 1996c) classifies this  pesticide as class I, which are highly toxic compounds. Harris et al.  (1998) reported a green frog (Rana clamitans) 16-day LC50 of >5.0 mg/L  for Guthion WP, a preparation of 50 percent AZM. Dolah et al. (1997)  reported that, in South Carolina streams, measured concentrations of  AZM at greater than 17  g/L have coincided with documented fish  kills. They reported that at a concentration of 20  g/L, 100  percent mortality occurs within a short time. The use of AZM in the  vicinity of the California tiger salamander could affect recruitment  and survival directly, or affect the food supply.     Endosulfan is a sulfur-containing organochlorine used for the  control of many insects on a wide variety of crops. Studies by Berrill  et al. (1998) reported severe toxicity to amphibians from exposure to  endosulfan, including extensive paralysis to several species of frog  and toad tadpoles, delayed metamorphosis and high death rates. Harris  et al. (1998) reported that green frogs exposed to Thiodan  (a  47 percent mixture of endosulfan) had a 16-d LC50 of greater than 5.0  mg/L. It is apparent that endosulfan is extremely toxic at low  concentrations to amphibians.     Five of the six metapopulations of California tiger salamanders  breeding sites in Santa Barbara County may be directly or indirectly  affected by toxic agricultural chemical contaminants because there is  intensive agriculture within their drainage basins. Even if toxic or  detectable amounts of pesticides are not found in the breeding ponds or  groundwater, salamanders may still be directly affected, particularly  when chemicals are applied during the migration and dispersal seasons. Rodent Control     California tiger salamanders spend much of their lives in  underground retreats, typically in the burrows of ground squirrels and  gophers (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a). Widespread ground squirrel  control programs were begun as early as 1910 and are carried out on  more than 4 million ha (9.9 million ac) in California (Marsh 1987). It  is unclear how effective such control programs were in reducing ground  squirrel populations. According to Marsh (1987), when a ground squirrel  population is at or near carrying capacity, it must be reduced by at  least 90 percent annually for several years to significantly reduce the  population.     It may not be practical to attain such high reduction rates over  large areas typical of rangelands, but it may be possible to reduce  populations to low numbers (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). In some primarily  agricultural counties, the ground squirrel population has been reduced  and maintained at perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the carrying capacity.  Rodent control programs are conducted by individual land owners and  managers on grazing, vineyard, and crop production lands (Rosemary  Thompson, Senior Biologist, SAIC, in litt. 1998).     Until about 1990, ground squirrel control programs using compound  1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) were carried out  [[Page 57260]]  on lands in Santa Barbara County (R. Thompson in litt. 1998). Compound  1080 is extremely toxic to nontarget fish, birds, and mammals (EPA  1990) and may have contributed to reductions in salamander populations  in the areas where it was used.     Poisoned grains are the most common method used to control ground  squirrels on rangelands, and there is little risk of ingestion by  California tiger salamanders. However the use of these grains may  impact the California tiger salamanders indirectly if washed into  burrows or ponds used by the species. Two of the most commonly used  rodenticides, chlorophacinone and diphacinone, are anticoagulants that  cause animals to bleed to death. They can be absorbed through the skin  and are considered toxic to fish and wildlife (EPA 1985, EXTOXNET  1996d). Both, along with strychnine, are used in Santa Barbara County  to control rodents (R. Thompson, in litt. 1998). Zinc phosphide, an  acute rodenticide and a restricted material, turns into a toxic gas  once ingested. Although the effects of these poisons on California  tiger salamanders have not been assessed, use along roadways or  railways may result in contamination of salamander breeding ponds, with  undetermined effects. Gases, including aluminum phosphide, carbon  monoxide, and methyl bromide, can be introduced into burrows either by  using cartridges or by pumping. When such fumigants are used, all  animals inhabiting the burrow are killed (Salmon and Schmidt 1984).     In addition to possible direct effects of rodent control chemicals,  control programs probably have an adverse indirect effect on California  tiger salamander populations. Control of ground squirrels could  significantly reduce the number of burrows available for use by the  species (Loredo-Prendeville et al. 1994). Because the burrow density  required to support California tiger salamanders in an area is not  known, the loss of burrows as a result of control programs and its  affect on salamanders cannot be quantified at this time. However,  Shaffer et al. (1993) believe that rodent control programs may be  responsible for the lack of California tiger salamanders in some areas.  Active ground squirrel colonies probably are needed to sustain tiger  salamanders because inactive burrow systems become progressively  unsuitable over time. Loredo et al. (1996) found that burrow systems  collapsed within 18 months following abandonment by or loss of the  ground squirrels. Although the researchers found that California tiger  salamanders used both occupied and unoccupied burrows, they did not  indicate that the salamanders used collapsed burrows. Current risks to  the salamander in Santa Barbara County from rodent control programs are  unknown. Mosquito Control     A commonly used method to control mosquitoes, including in Santa  Barbara County (Kenneth Leanard, Santa Barbara County Vector Control,  pers. comm. 1999) is the application of methoprene, which increases the  level of juvenile hormone in insect larvae and disrupts the molting  process. Lawrenz (1984-85) found that methoprene (Altosid  SR- 10) retarded the development of selected crustacea that had the same  molting hormones ( i.e., juvenile hormone) as insects and anticipated  that the same hormone may control metamorphosis in other arthropods.  Because the success of many aquatic vertebrates relies on an abundance  of invertebrates in temporary wetlands, any delay in insect growth  could reduce the numbers and density of prey available (Lawrenz 1984- 85). The use of methoprene thus could have an indirect adverse effect  on the California tiger salamander by reducing the availability of  prey. In more recent studies, although methoprene did not cause  increased mortality of gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles  (Sparling and Lowe 1998), it caused reduced survival rates and  increased malformations in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens)  (Ankley et al. 1998) and increased malformations in southern leopard  frogs (R. utricularia) (Sparling 1998). Blumberg et al. (1998) also  correlated exposure to methoprene with delayed metamorphosis and high  mortality rates in northern leopard and mink (R. septentrionalis)  frogs. Methoprene appears to have both direct and indirect effects on  the growth and survival of larval amphibians.     Other insecticides (e.g., temephos) have caused reductions in the  growth rates of gray treefrog tadpoles, increased mortality rates in  green frog (R. clamitans) tadpoles (Sparling and Lowe 1998), and  increased mortality rates in southern leopard frogs (Sparling 1998).  Few data are available on the effects of most insecticides on  salamanders. A bacterium, Bacillus thuringensis israeli (Bti), is also  used in Santa Barbara County for mosquito control (K. Leanard, pers.  comm. 1999). Its effects on the salamander prey base have not been  quantified. Because of a lack of information regarding which mosquito  control chemicals are used and where, and about the chemicals' effects  on salamanders, the degree to which the practices directly affect the  California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County cannot be  determined at this time. Introduced Species     Introduced species can have negative effects on California tiger  salamander populations through competition and hybridization (Shaffer  et al. 1993; H.B. Shaffer in litt. 1999). Competition from fish that  prey on mosquito larvae and other invertebrates can reduce the survival  of salamanders. Both California tiger salamanders (Stebbins 1962; J. D.  Anderson 1968; Holomuzki 1986) and mosquitofish feed on micro and  macro-invertebrates; large numbers of mosquitofish may out-compete the  salamander larvae for food (Graf 1993). As urban areas continue to  expand, the introduction of mosquitofish into previously untreated  ponds may result in the elimination of California tiger salamanders  from additional breeding sites. The introduction of other fish either  inadvertently (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas) (P. Collins, pers.  comm. 1999) or for recreational fishing (e.g., bass (Micropterus  salmoides, M. dolomieu), sunfish (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1999) or other  purposes may also affect the prey base, reducing growth and survival  rates of salamanders. Fish such as bass, green sunfish (L. cyanellus),  carp (Cyprinus carpio), and bullhead (Ictalurus spp.) may also prey on  tiger salamander larvae, reducing or eliminating populations (Shaffer  et al. 1993). Introduced Tiger Salamanders     Various nonnative subspecies of the tiger salamander, Ambystoma  tigrinum, have been imported into much of California for use as fish  bait. The practice is still legal in California but is now restricted  to fewer counties and is regulated by the California Department of Fish  and Game (CCR Title 14, Division 1, Subdivision 1, Chapter 2, Article  3, Section 4 1999). Although importation into Santa Barbara County is  illegal, introduced tiger salamanders have been documented at one  locality west of the Santa Rita Valley (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998). A  recently discovered breeding population on the Lompoc Federal Prison  property are probably non-native tiger salamanders as well (Storrer in  litt. 2000); tissue from these larvae are being analyzed to confirm  their identity. Although they have not been documented in California  tiger salamander habitat, nonnative salamanders could potentially be  introduced into breeding sites or into nearby ponds. The introduced  salamanders may out-compete the California tiger salamander, or  [[Page 57261]]  interbreed with the natives to create hybrids that may be less adapted  to the California climate or are not reproductively viable past the  first or second generations (Bury and Lukenbach 1976; Shaffer et al.  1993). More recent evidence suggests that the hybrids are viable, and  that they breed with California tiger salamanders (H.B. Shaffer in  litt. 1999). With so few remaining subpopulations of California tiger  salamanders in Santa Barbara County, the loss of any to hybridization  with or competition from introduced species is of serious concern. Grazing     Grazing in many cases has positive, or at least neutral, effects on  the California tiger salamander (H.B. Shaffer and Peter Trenham, UCD,  pers. comm. 1998; S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998; 1999). By keeping  vegetation shorter, grazing can make areas more suitable for ground  squirrels, whose burrows are used by California tiger salamanders. In  Santa Barbara County, the only remaining sites with large amounts of  suitable salamander habitat currently are being grazed. Although cattle  drink large quantities of water, sometimes causing temporary pools to  dry faster than they otherwise would (Sheri Melanson, Service, in litt.  1993) and possibly causing breeding pools to dry too quickly for  salamanders to be able to metamorphose (Feaver 1971), these rangelands  are the only undeveloped habitat in the area and thus provide the only  chance for salamanders to maintain large, sustainable populations.  Although Melanson (in litt. 1993) noted that vernal pool species  continued to reproduce under a November-to-April grazing regime,  California tiger salamanders were either absent or found in low numbers  in portions of pools that were heavily trampled by cattle. Continued  trampling of a pond's edge by cattle can increase the surface area of a  pond and may increase water temperature and speed up the rate of  evaporation and thus reduce the amount of time the pond contains enough  water (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998). Cattle hoofprints could trap  salamanders as water levels in pools recede, and reduction in water  quality caused by cattle excrement may negatively affect the animals  mainly by increasing potentially detrimental nitrogen levels. High  nitrogen levels have been associated with blooms of deadly bacteria  (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), and silt has been associated with fatal  fungal infections (Lefcort et al. 1997) (see Factor C of this section).  However, grazing generally is compatible with the continued use of  rangelands by the California tiger salamander as long as intensive  burrowing rodent control programs are not implemented on such areas and  grazing is not excessive (T. Jones in litt. 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993;  S. Sweet pers. comm. 1998, 1999). Water Drawdowns     Many of the ponds in northern Santa Barbara County are subject to  drawdowns for agricultural uses, including irrigation and frost  control. Water is removed from the pond using submersible pumps. This  has a two-fold effect to California tiger salamander inhabiting these  ponds: (1) Salamander larvae and adults may be sucked into the pump  mechanism during drawdowns for frost control, killing them in the  process (P. Collins in litt. 2000a), and (2) ponds may be subject to  premature drying in the spring and summer, resulting in the stranding  of larvae before they are able to metamorphose.     In developing this final rule, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders. This DPS is one of the two  most genetically differentiated populations of the species, probably  deserving recognition as a separate species, and is restricted to very  few areas, all of which are threatened to some degree by agricultural  conversion, fragmentation, or urban development. As discussed under  Factor A of this section, ponds and upland habitats are being lost at a  rapid rate in five of the six regions of the county in which the  species occurs, and no preserves have been established to protect the  species. As discussed in Factor E of this section, this salamander is a  DPS and still occurs in a significant part of its historic range, but  the remaining subpopulations are becoming increasingly fragmented and  thus vulnerable to threats associated with isolation and small  population size. From the discussion under Factor D of this section, it  is clear that Federal, State, and local regulations and ordinances,  individually and collectively, do not provide adequate protection for  California tiger salamanders or assure that California tiger  salamanders will continue to survive in Santa Barbara County.     Of the 26 known breeding sites, 24 are located exclusively on  privately owned land and the other 2 are partially on Santa Barbara  County property. Upland habitats surrounding 25 of the ponds are  exclusively privately owned; the remaining habitat is a patchwork of  county and private lands. No conservation agreements or easements  adequate to ensure the long term viability of any metapopulation are in  place. Given the extremely rapid rate of recent and projected habitat  loss and degradation, this Santa Barbara DPS is in imminent danger of  extinction throughout most of its historic range, and may have been  eliminated from one area (Bradley-Dominion) in the last 2 years. The  survival of the Santa Barbara DPS of the California tiger salamander  now depends on protecting as many breeding sites and their associated  upland habitats from further degradation and destruction as possible,  and on the rapid rehabilitation of sites that have been seriously  degraded in the last few years. The remaining subpopulations in Santa  Barbara County are vulnerable to extinction from random natural or  human-caused events unless sufficient habitat can be protected and the  subpopulations increased in size. Immediately upon publication, this  final rule will continue the protection for this DPS of California  tiger salamanders, which began when we emergency listed this DPS on  January 19, 2000. Critical Habitat     In the last few years, a series of court decisions have overturned  our determinations regarding a variety of species that designation of  critical habitat would not be prudent (e.g., Natural Resources Defense  Council v. U.S. Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d 1121 (9th Cir.  1997); Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp. 2d 1280  (D. Hawaii 1998)). Based on the standards applied in those judicial  opinions, we have examined the question of whether critical habitat for  the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander would be prudent.     Due to the small number of populations the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander is vulnerable to unrestricted collection,  vandalism, or other disturbance. However, we have examined the evidence  available for Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander and have  not found specific evidence of taking, vandalism, collection, or trade  of this species. Consequently, consistent with applicable regulations  (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)(I)) and recent case law, we do not expect that the  identification of critical habitat will increase the degree of threat  to this species of taking or other human activity.     In the absence of a finding that critical habitat would increase  threats to a species, if there are any benefits to critical habitat  designation, then a  [[Page 57262]]  prudent finding is warranted. In the case of this species, there may be  some benefits to designation of critical habitat. The primary  regulatory effect of critical habitat is the section 7 requirement that  Federal agencies refrain from taking any action that destroys or  adversely modifies critical habitat. While a critical habitat  designation for habitat currently occupied by this species would not be  likely to change the section 7 consultation outcome because an action  that destroys or adversely modifies such critical habitat would also be  likely to result in jeopardy to the species, there may be instances  where section 7 consultation would be triggered only if critical  habitat is designated. Examples could include unoccupied habitat or  occupied habitat that may become unoccupied in the future. There may  also be some educational or informational benefits to designating  critical habitat. Therefore, we find that critical habitat is prudent  for the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander.     Critical habitat is not determinable when one or both of the  following situations exist: the information needed to analyze the  impacts of the designation is lacking, or the biological needs of the  species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an  area as critical habitat (50 CFR 424.12). We believe we understand the  biological needs of the Santa Barbara County California tiger  salamander sufficiently well to identify an area appropriate to  designate as critical habitat. However, our review of the comments we  received following the emergency listing of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander indicates the potential impacts of a  critical habitat designation are not so well understood that we can  complete the analyses required under subsection 4(b) of the Act.  Accordingly, we have found that critical habitat for the California  tiger salamander is not determinable at this time.     When we find that critical habitat is not determinable, our  regulations (50 CFR 424.17) provide that, within one year of the date  of the final rule listing the species, we must publish a final rule  designating critical habitat, based on the best information available  at the time. We will undertake critical habitat determinations and  designations during FY 2001 as allowed by our funding allocation for  that year. As explained in detail in the Listing Priority Guidance (64  FR 57114), our listing budget is currently insufficient to allow us to  immediately complete all of the listing actions required by the Act. We  plan to employ a priority system for deciding which outstanding  critical habitat designations should be addressed first. We will focus  our efforts on those designations that will provide the most  conservation benefit, taking into consideration the efficacy of  critical habitat designation in addressing the threats to the species,  and the magnitude and immediacy of those threats. We will develop a  proposal to designate critical habitat for the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander as soon as feasible, considering our  workload priorities and available funding. Available Conservation Measures     Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  practices. Recognition through listing results in public awareness and  conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private  organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land  acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery  actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required  of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities  involving listed species are discussed, in part, below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  listed as endangered or threatened, and with respect to the species'  critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing  this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50  CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to  confer with us on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued  existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse  modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species subsequently is  listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that  activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal agency action may  affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible  Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with us. Federal  agency actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders and may require conference and/or  consultation with us include, but are not limited to, those within the  jurisdiction of the Corps, Bureau of Reclamation, Natural Resources  Conservation Service, Federal Farm Bureau, and Federal Highway  Administration.     Listing this species provides for the development of a recovery  plan, which would bring together Federal, State, local, and private  efforts for the conservation of the species. The plan would establish a  framework for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each  other in conservation efforts. The plan would set recovery priorities  and estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It  also would describe site-specific management actions necessary to  achieve conservation and survival of the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders. Additionally, pursuant to  section 6 of the Act, we would be able to grant funds to the State for  management actions promoting the protection and recovery of the  salamander.     The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set  forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for  any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take  (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,  capture, or collect; or attempt any such conduct), import or export,  ship in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial  activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce  any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,  carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken  illegally. Certain exceptions apply to our agents and those of State  conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving endangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations  governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. For  endangered species, such permits are available for scientific purposes,  to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and for  incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.     As published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34272),  it is our policy to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the  time a species is listed those activities that would or would not  constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this  policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on  proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range.     We believe that, based on the best available information, the  following  [[Page 57263]]  actions are not likely to result in a violation of section 9, provided  these actions are carried out in accordance with any existing  regulations and permit requirements:     (1) Possession of a Santa Barbara County California tiger  salamander legally acquired prior to the effective date of the  emergency rule, published on January 19, 2000, and being held  consistent with regulations at 50 CFR 17.4;     (2) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a  Federal agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with an  incidental take statement issued by us under section 7 of the Act;     (3) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are not authorized, funded, or carried out by a  Federal agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with an  incidental take permit issued by us under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act. To obtain a permit, an applicant must develop a habitat  conservation plan and apply for an incidental take permit that  minimizes and mitigates impacts to the species to the maximum extent  practicable; and     (4) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are conducted in accordance with the conditions  of a section 10(a)(1)(A) permit for scientific research or to enhance  the propagation or survival of the species.     We believe that, without appropriate authorization from us pursuant  to sections 7 and 10 of the Act, the following actions may result in a  violation of section 9; however, possible violations are not limited to  these actions:     (1) Unauthorized collecting, trapping, capturing, killing,  harassing, sale, delivery, or movement, including interstate, and  foreign commerce, or harming, or attempting any of these actions, of  Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders without a permit  (research activities where salamanders are trapped or captured will  require a permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species  Act);     (2) Destruction or alteration of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander occupied habitat through the discharge of  fill material into breeding sites; draining, ditching, tilling, stream  channelization, drilling, pumping, or other activities that interrupt  surface or ground water flow into or out of the vernal pool and  seasonal pond habitats of this species (i.e., due to the construction,  installation, or operation and maintenance of roads, impoundments,  discharge or drain pipes, storm water detention basins, wells, water  diversion structures, etc.);     (3) Discharges or dumping of toxic chemicals, silt, or other  pollutants into, or other alteration of the quality of waters  supporting Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders that  results in death or injury of the species or that results in  degradation of their occupied habitat;     (4) Release of exotic species (including, but not limited to,  bullfrogs, eastern tiger salamanders, mosquitofish, bass, sunfish,  bullhead, catfish, crayfish) into Santa Barbara County tiger salamander  breeding habitat; and     (5) Destruction or alteration of uplands associated with vernal  pool or seasonal pond habitats used by Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamanders during estivation and dispersal, or modification of  migration routes such that migration and dispersal are reduced or  precluded.     Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a  violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of  the Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section).     Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed species and  inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 NE 11th  Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063, facsimile 503/231- 6243). National Environmental Policy Act     We have determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined  under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,  need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to  section 4(a) of the Act, as amended. We published a notice outlining  our reasons for this determination in the Federal Register on October  25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). Paperwork Reduction Act     This rule does not contain any collections of information that  require Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the  Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An information  collection related to the rule pertaining to permits for endangered and  threatened species has OMB approval and is assigned clearance number  1018-0094. This rule does not alter that information collection  requirement. For additional information concerning permits and  associated requirements for endangered wildlife, see 50 CFR 17.21 and  17.22.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine  the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus brunneus) to  be a threatened species under the authority of the Endangered Species  Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. This subspecies is known from 36 sites  in Adams and Valley counties, Idaho. It is primarily threatened by  habitat loss due to forest encroachment into former suitable meadow  habitats. Forest encroachment results in habitat fragmentation,  eliminates dispersal corridors, and restricts the northern Idaho ground  squirrel population into small isolated habitat areas. The subspecies  is also threatened by competition from the larger Columbian ground  squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus), land use changes, recreational  shooting, poisoning, and naturally occurring events. This rule extends  Federal protection provisions provided by the Act for the northern  Idaho ground squirrel.  EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective May 5, 2000.  ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection,  by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, Snake River Basin Office, 1387 South Vinnell Way,  Room 368, Boise, Idaho 83709.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Ruesink, Supervisor, at the  above address (telephone 208/378-5243; facsimile 208/378-5262).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The northern Idaho ground squirrel has the most restricted  geographical range of any Spermophilus taxa, and one of the smallest  ranges among North American mainland mammals (Gill and Yensen 1992).  The first specimens, collected by L.E. Wyman in 1913, were described by  A.H. Howell as Citellus townsendii brunneus, a subspecies of the  Washington ground squirrel (Spermophilus washingtoni) (Howell 1938). In  1938, Howell subsequently classified the Idaho ground squirrel as a  full species, Citellus brunneus. Hershkovitz (1949) demonstrated that  Spermophilus is the correct name for this genus. Nadler (1966) first  presented chromosome descriptions and confirmed the systematics of  Spermophilus. Yensen (1991) described the southern Idaho ground  squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus endemicus) as taxonomically distinct,  based on morphology, pelage (fur), and apparent life-history  differences including biogeographical evidence of separation.     Both the northern and southern Idaho ground squirrels are found  only in western Idaho. Of the two subspecies, the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is the rarest (Yensen 1991). A relatively small member of the  genus Spermophilus, the mean length of northern Idaho ground squirrel  males and females is 235 millimeters (mm) (9.25 inches (in.)) and 226  mm (8.9 in.), respectively. In comparison, the mean length of southern  Idaho ground squirrel males is 241 mm (9.5 in.) and 235 mm (9.25 in.)  for females (Yensen 1991). Pelage in northern Idaho ground squirrel  differs from the southern Idaho ground squirrel in its mid-dorsal area,  which consists of long, dark guard hairs and shorter, dark guard hairs  with one paler-colored band on the shield (Yensen 1991). Most northern  Idaho ground squirrels are found in areas with shallow reddish parent  soils of basaltic origin, while the southern Idaho ground squirrel  lives on lower elevation, paler colored soils formed by granitic sands  and clays from the Boise Mountains (Yensen 1985, 1991). Marked  differences in pelage coloration between the disjunct subspecies are  related to soil color.     The baculum (penis bone) of northern Idaho ground squirrel is also  generally smaller than the southern Idaho ground squirrel. A principal  component analysis, which is a statistical analysis that proves  similarities or differences, indicated a striking difference among  bacula of the two subspecies (Yensen 1991). Genetic differentiation  between the two subspecies was also confirmed using enzyme restriction  analysis, blood allozyme analyses, and DNA protein sequencing, all of  which analyze blood constituents to determine genetic differences (Gill  and Yensen 1992; Sherman and Yensen 1994).     The northern Idaho ground squirrel emerges in late March or early  April, remains active above ground until late July or early August  (Yensen 1991), and spends the rest of the year in hibernation  underground (Eric Yensen, Albertson College, pers. comm. 1999).  Populations occur at elevations ranging from 1,155 to 1,580 meters (m)  (3,800 to 5,200 feet (ft)) in Adams and Valley counties of western  Idaho. In contrast, the southern Idaho ground squirrel occurs at  elevations ranging from 669 to 973 m (2,200 to 3,200 ft) in the low  rolling hills and valleys along the Payette River in Gem, Payette, and  Washington counties of western Idaho (Yensen 1991). The southern  subspecies emerges in late January or early February where snow melt  begins 1 to 2 months earlier in spring, and ceases above-ground  activity in late June or early July. The emergence of the northern  Idaho ground squirrel in late March or early April begins with adult  males, followed by adult females, then young of the year.     The northern Idaho ground squirrel normally becomes reproductively  active within the first 2 weeks of emergence (Yensen 1991). Females  that survive the first winter live, on average, nearly twice as long as  males (3.2 years for females and 1.7 years for males). Individual  females have lived for 8 years (Yensen 1991). Males normally die at a  younger age due to behavior associated with reproductive activity.  During the mating period, males move considerable distances in search  of receptive females for mating and often fight with other males for  copulations, thereby exposing themselves to predation by raptors  including prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), goshawk (Accipiter  gentilis), and red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). Significantly more  males die or disappear during the 2-week mating period than during the  rest of the 12- to 14-week period of above-ground activity (Sherman and  Yensen 1994). Seasonal torpor (a state of sluggishness or inactivity)  generally occurs in early to mid-July for males and females, and late  July to early August for juveniles.     Unlike many ground squirrel species, the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is not truly colonial. In this final rule, local areas where  this subspecies occurs are referred to as ``sites.'' In 1985, the  estimated population of northern Idaho ground squirrels at 18 known  sites was approximately 5,000 squirrels (John Woflin, Service, in litt.  1985). Subsequent surveys were conducted on a sporadic basis from 1986  through 1993; more intensive efforts to estimate populations at 10  sites began in 1994 (Sherman and Yensen 1994). While new population  sites were found during these surveys, several previously active sites  became extirpated (Paul Sherman, Cornell University, pers. comm.,  1997). In 1996, the total population had  [[Page 17780]]  declined to fewer than 1,000 individuals found at 19 sites (Sherman and  Gavin 1997). Only 1 of these sites contained more than 60 animals. In  1997 and 1998, additional locations with northern Idaho ground  squirrels were found for a total of 36 historic and currently active  sites. However the total population estimate still remains less than  1,000 individuals. Of the 36 sites, 14 occur on public lands (Federal  and State). At 3 of these 14 sites, the subspecies has been extirpated,  and at 1 site, the subspecies was extirpated but has been reintroduced.  There are 22 sites on private lands, but at 7 of the sites, the  subspecies has been extirpated. The number of squirrels in many of the  active sites has been decreasing for over 10 years (Yensen 1980, 1985;  J. Woflin, in litt. 1985; Sherman and Yensen 1994; Gavin et al. 1998).     Soil texture and depth can be a primary factor in determining  species distribution for most Spermophilus (Brown and Harney 1993). The  northern Idaho ground squirrel often digs burrows under logs, rocks, or  other objects (Sherman and Yensen 1994). Dry vegetation sites with  shallow soil horizons of less than 50 centimeters (19.6 in.) depth  above basalt bedrock to develop burrow systems are preferred (Yensen et  al. 1991). Burrows associated with shallow soils are called auxiliary  burrows. Nesting burrows are found in well-drained soils greater than 1  m (3 ft) deep, in areas not covered with trees or used by Columbian  ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus). Although Columbian ground  squirrels overlap in distribution with the northern Idaho ground  squirrel (Dyni and Yensen 1996), Columbian ground squirrels prefer  moister areas with deeper soils. Sherman and Yensen (1994) report that  the lack of extensive use of the same areas by the two subspecies is  likely due to competition, rather than to each subspecies having  different habitat requirements.     Nearly all of the meadow habitats utilized by northern Idaho ground  squirrels are bordered by coniferous forests of Pinus ponderosa  (ponderosa pine) and/or Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir). However,  this ground squirrel is not abundant in meadows that are surrounded by  high densities of small young trees (Sherman and Yensen 1994).     The northern Idaho ground squirrel is granivorous (eats small seeds  and grain) seasonally, similar to the Columbian ground squirrel (Dyni  and Yensen 1996), and ingests large amounts of Poa species (bluegrass)  and other grass seeds to store energy for the winter. The northern  Idaho ground squirrel will consume the roots, bulbs, leaf stems, and  flower heads of another 45 to 50 plant species that are major  components of the diet during key periods of the spring and summer. The  Columbian ground squirrel often inhabits areas with denser vegetation  than the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Dyni and Yensen 1996). Such  areas contain more abundant food resources than habitats occupied by  northern Idaho ground squirrel (Belovsky and Schmitz 1994). The  northern Idaho ground squirrel is found on lands administered by the  U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service), Idaho State Department of Lands,  and private property.  Previous Federal Action      In a status review published January 6, 1989, we determined that  the northern Idaho ground squirrel was a category 1 candidate (56 FR  562). Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which we had on file  substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to  support preparation of listing proposals. Upon publication of the  February 28, 1996, Notice of Review (61 FR 7596), we ceased using  category designations and included the northern Idaho ground squirrel  as a candidate species. Candidate species are those for which we have  on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats  to support proposals to list the species as threatened or endangered.  Candidate status for this animal was continued in the September 19,  1997, Notice of Review (62 FR 49398).     As a result of long-standing litigation with the Fund for Animals,  a lawsuit settlement of January 21, 1997, directed us to make a  decision (i.e., prepare a proposed rule to list or remove from Federal  candidacy) concerning the northern Idaho ground squirrel on or before  April 1, 1998. A proposed rule to list the subspecies as threatened was  published on March 23, 1998 (63 FR 13825).     The processing of this final rule conforms with our Listing  Priority Guidance published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1999  (64 FR 57114). The guidance clarifies the order in which we will  process rulemakings. Highest priority is processing emergency listing  rules for any species determined to face a significant and imminent  risk to its well-being (Priority 1). Second priority (Priority 2) is  processing final determinations on proposed additions to the lists of  endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Third priority is  processing new proposals to add species to the lists. The processing of  administrative petition findings (petitions  filed  under section 4 of  the Act) is the fourth priority. This final rule is a Priority 2 action  and is being completed in accordance with the current Listing Priority  Guidance. We have updated this rule to reflect any changes in  information concerning distribution, status, and threats since the  publication of the proposed rule.  Summary of Comments and Recommendations      In the proposed rule (63 FR 13825), we requested all interested  parties to submit factual reports or information that might contribute  to the development of a final rule for the northern Idaho ground  squirrel. We contacted appropriate State agencies, county governments,  Federal agencies, scientists, landowners, and other interested parties  and requested them to comment. We opened a public comment period of 60  days on March 23, 1998, and closed it on May 22, 1998 (63 FR 13825). On  March 13, 1998, we sent legal notices that invited public comment and  announced a public hearing. The notice was published in The Idaho  Statesman, Council Record, Adams County Leader, and the Central Idaho  Star News on March 28, 1998. In anticipation of public interest, we  conducted a public hearing on May 5, 1998, in Council, Idaho at the  Council Elementary School. To consider new scientific information, we  reopened the public comment period for 30 days on October 21, 1998 (63  FR 56134). A legal notice concerning the public comment period was  published on October 27, 1998, in The Idaho Statesman. This comment  period closed on November 20, 1998.     During the 3-month comment period, we received a total of seven  comments. Of these comments, one supported listing, and two opposed the  listing. Four comments were noncommittal. We reviewed all of the  comments (i.e., written and oral testimony) referenced above. The  comments were grouped and are discussed under the following issue  headings. In addition, we considered and incorporated, as appropriate,  into the final rule, all biological and commercial information obtained  through the public comment period.  Peer Review      In compliance with our July 1, 1994, Peer Review Policy (59 FR  34270), we solicited the expert opinion of an independent scientist  regarding pertinent scientific or commercial data and issues relating  to the supportive biological and ecological information for the  northern Idaho ground squirrel. Information and suggestions provided by  the reviewer were considered in  [[Page 17781]]  developing this final rule, and incorporated where applicable.     Issue 1: One commenter believed there was a general lack of  adequate information about the squirrels or sufficient searches for  additional sites to publish a final rule. This responder was also  concerned that key Forest Service staff and the primary research  personnel involved in studying the northern Idaho ground squirrel  intend to leave the project.     Our Response: We, the Forest Service, and the Idaho Department of  Fish and Game have provided equipment, funding, and staff to support  surveys for new populations and monitoring of existing populations  since 1994. In 1998, additional surveys for the northern Idaho ground  squirrel were conducted on lands owned by Boise Cascade Corporation  (John Haufler, Boise Cascade Corporation, pers. comm., 1998). The  surveys used vegetation habitat analysis, historical references, and  anecdotal information from foresters, ranchers, engineers, and  biologists. Staff at the Payette National Forest collated and field- validated the information and placed it on a geographical information  systems (GIS) map. Analysis of GIS maps allows biologists to predict  potential habitat for the species throughout its present range. A team  of biologists spent several weeks in 1997 and 1998 surveying the  potential sites for ground squirrel activity. The known historic and  extant sites increased from 19 in 1996 to 36 in 1998. Of these 36  sites, 27 are currently occupied by northern Idaho ground squirrels.  However, most of these sites have less than 20 individuals, and the  total population numbers less than 1,000. Only by conducting annual  monitoring of sites where animals were translocated from other sites  and existing sites will we be able to document future population  trends.     Two scientists from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, who have  overseen recent translocations, surveys, and annual monitoring notified  us that they will not be able to continue this work in the future.  However, one of these scientists agreed to assist with field surveys in  1999, and instructed a team of biologists from the Idaho Department of  Fish and Game, Payette National Forest, and the Service for 2 weeks in  survey and monitoring methods. This team will continue to coordinate  annual surveys for new populations, collect data on population trends,  and monitor habitat changes in coordination with the Payette National  Forest staff.     Issue 2: One commenter requested that the northern Idaho ground  squirrel not be listed because listing does not consider the impact of  human welfare, local economy, public value, and private property  rights.     Our Response: In accordance with 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(1)(A) and 50 CFR  424.11 (b), listing decisions are made solely on the basis of the best  scientific and commercial data available. In adding the word ``solely''  to the statutory criteria for listing a species, Congress specifically  addressed this issue in the 1982 amendments to the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  et seq.). The legislative history of the 1982 amendments states: ``The  addition of the word solely is intended to remove from the process of  the listing or delisting of species any factor not related to the  biological status of the species' H.R. Rep. No. 567, Part I, 97th  Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1982).     Issue 3: One commenter asserted that constitutional powers were  being violated to list the northern Idaho ground squirrel under the Act  since there is no substantial and documented interstate commerce  involving this subspecies. This assertion is based on the belief that  the intention of the U.S. Constitution is to regulate only those  activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.     Our Response: The Federal Government has the authority under the  Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to protect this subspecies,  for the reasons given in Judge Wald's opinion and Judge Henderson's  concurring opinion in National Association of Home Builders v. Babbitt,  130 F.3d 1041 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 1185 S. Ct. 2340 (1998).  That case involved a challenge to application of the Act's prohibitions  to protect the listed Delhi Sands flower-loving fly (Rhaphiomidas  terminatus abdominalis). As with the northern Idaho ground squirrel,  the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly is endemic to only one State. Judge  Wald held that application of the Act's prohibition against taking of  endangered species to this fly was a proper exercise of Commerce Clause  power to regulate: (1) Use of channels of interstate commerce; and (2)  activities substantially affecting interstate commerce, because it  prevented loss of biodiversity and destructive interstate competition.  Judge Henderson upheld protection of the fly because doing so prevents  harm to the ecosystem upon which interstate commerce depends, and  because doing so regulates commercial development that is part of  interstate commerce.     The Federal Government also has the authority under the Property  Clause of the Constitution to protect this subspecies. The northern  Idaho ground squirrel occurs on the Payette National Forest, Idaho  State lands, and private lands. If this subspecies were to become  extinct, the diversity of vertebrate life in the Payette National  Forest would be diminished. The courts have long recognized Federal  authority under the Property Clause to protect Federal resources in  such circumstances (See Kleppe v. New Mexico, 429 U.S. 873 (1976);  United States v. Alford, 274 U.S. 264 (1927); Camfield v. United  States, 167 U. S. 518 (1897); United States v. Lindsey, 595 F. 2d 5  (9th Cir. 1979).  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated  to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures  for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to  be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five  factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their  application to the northern Idaho ground squirrel are as follows:  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of its Habitat or Range      The historic range of the northern Idaho ground squirrel is not  well known. However, it is thought that this subspecies was relatively  uncommon throughout its historic range (Forest Service 1997a). All  remaining habitat sites for the northern Idaho ground squirrel are  small in relation to those of other ground squirrels, ranging in size  from 1.2 to 16 hectares (3 to 40 acres), and all are threatened by one  or more of the following: forest encroachment into grassland meadows;  conversion to agriculture; residential construction; development of  recreational facilities such as golf courses; and road construction and  maintenance.     The primary threat to the northern Idaho ground squirrel is meadow  invasion by conifers (Sherman and Yensen 1994; E. Yensen, pers. comm.  1998, 1999). Fire suppression and the dense regrowth of conifers  resulting from past logging activities have significantly reduced  meadow habitats suitable for northern Idaho ground squirrels over the  past 40 years. As the amount of suitable meadow habitat on public and  private lands has been reduced, northern Idaho ground squirrel  dispersal corridors have been reduced or eliminated, further  constricting the subspecies into smaller isolated habitat areas (Truksa  and Yensen 1990). The loss of dispersal corridors has caused some  isolated populations to become extirpated in recent years (Sherman and  [[Page 17782]]  Yensen 1994; Service 1996). Small populations at several remaining  sites are likely to become extirpated as well (Sherman and Yensen 1994;  Mangel and Tier 1994).     The fragmented distribution of the northern Idaho ground squirrel  is a remnant of what may once have been a more continuous distribution  from Round Valley, Idaho, in Valley County north to New Meadows, Idaho,  and southwest to Council, Idaho, in Adams County. The forest structure  in the area has changed markedly over the past century due to logging  and fire suppression, resulting in denser, more even-aged younger  stands of trees with thinner and less heterogeneous (not uniform)  under-story plant communities (Burns and Zborowski 1996). Fire  suppression allowed conifers to invade once suitable meadow habitats,  thereby shrinking the size of forb/grass meadows or closing open grassy  dispersal/migration corridors entirely to nearby meadow sites. These  changes isolated the dry meadows with suitable shallow soils where the  northern Idaho ground squirrel finds refuge from the Columbian ground  squirrel, in addition to eliminating migration between northern Idaho  ground squirrel sites. Remaining dry meadow habitats supporting  northern Idaho ground squirrels are now being invaded by young conifer  trees, reducing availability of the preferred forage and burrow habitat  of this subspecies. Habitat dissection and reduced opportunities for  dispersal among habitats prevents gene flow and results in considerable  population differentiation (Sherman and Yensen 1994).     Agricultural conversion and rural housing developments near the  communities of Round Valley, north to New Meadows, and south to  Council, during the past 40 years have fragmented suitable habitats  formerly occupied by the northern Idaho ground squirrel. Various types  of developments continue to threaten remaining occupied sites in Adams  and Valley counties. Occupied ground squirrel habitat near New Meadows  was converted to a golf course and associated housing development  (Yensen 1985), which resulted in the eradication of northern Idaho  ground squirrels by poisoning because they were impacting the fairways  and golf greens (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1999).     A 51.5 kilometer (km) (32 mile (mi)) gravel road from Council to  Cuprum, Idaho, is scheduled to be paved by the year 2001 (U.S.  Department of Transportation 1998). Approximately 6.4 km (4 mi) of this  project runs through historic and currently occupied habitat of the  northern Idaho ground squirrel. The road improvement project will  seasonally extend vehicle access to four occupied northern Idaho ground  squirrel sites. These four sites will be subject to increased mortality  risk from vehicular traffic, and possibly recreational shooting (Forest  Service 1997a). The Federal Highways Administration consulted with us  and the Forest Service in developing conservation measures as part of  their biological assessment for the Council to Cuprum Road paving  project (Forest Service 1997a). Conservation measures include actions  to attract northern Idaho ground squirrels away from the paved highway  to adjacent but suitable habitat to avoid passing vehicles. Funding for  these conservation measures was approved by the U.S. Department of  Transportation to monitor the measures before and after the road  improvements have been made. Monitoring was initiated in 1998 and will  continue through 2003. At this time, it is uncertain whether the  proposed conservation measures will be successful in protecting  remaining populations in the vicinity of the road improvement project.  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      Recreational shooting has contributed to the decline of northern  Idaho ground squirrels at various sites (Yensen 1985, 1991; E. Yensen,  pers. comm. 1999). Sites adjacent to housing developments, farms, and  roads, in particular, are subject to a high rate of recreational  shooting.     Four population sites have been documented as being subjected to  recreational shooting (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1998). One site is  located next to a road on National Forest land. It was common to find  .22 rifle casings on the road from people presumably shooting the  ground squirrels. The subspecies has now been extirpated from this site  as a result of shooting. Another site on private land that had both  northern Idaho ground squirrels and Columbian ground squirrels was  routinely used by recreational shooters, and, as a result, the  population is now extinct there. Another site on private land at New  Meadows was periodically used by recreational shooters until a golf  course was put in at the site. The operators of the golf course then  poisoned the remaining population of northern Idaho ground squirrels to  eliminate them. The fourth site is partially located on private land  and partially located on Forest Service land and also is subjected to  shooting (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1999).     Vandalism, either by shooting or poisoning, is a threat to most of  the populations. Many private landowners consider ground squirrels to  be a pest that requires elimination. In June 1998, Dr. Eric Yensen of  Albertson College, who has done research on the subspecies, approached  a private landowner for permission to check on a northern Idaho ground  squirrel population occurring on his land. The landowner told Dr.  Yensen he wanted to know where the population was so he could go out  and poison them. Since the landowner was threatening to eliminate the  population, Dr. Yensen declined to tell him exactly where the site was.  Dr. Yensen was then refused permission to check on the site by the  landowner. Other landowners have made similar threats against northern  Idaho ground squirrel populations to Dr. Yensen (E. Yensen, pers. comm.  1999). Since most of the population sites contain less than 20 animals,  and less than 1,000 animals overall, shooting and poisoning could have  significant adverse impacts (E. Yensen, pers. comm. 1999).  C. Disease or Predation      Disease is not thought to be a major factor affecting the northern  Idaho ground squirrel. The parasitic nematode, Pelodera strongyloides,  infects the eyes of the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Sherman and  Yensen 1994; Yensen et al. 1996). This eye worm is not currently known  to be a cause of mortality in existing populations (Yensen et al.  1996). Plague (Yersina pestis) a contagious bacterial disease in  rodents, has not yet been found in any northern Idaho ground squirrel  populations (Yensen et al. 1996.). The disease, once established, could  decimate these squirrels. Blood analysis to determine whether pandemic  diseases are present have not been done on the northern Idaho ground  squirrel.     The primary predators of the northern Idaho ground squirrel include  badger (Taxidea taxus), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), prairie falcon  (Falco mexicanus), and occasionally red-tailed hawk (Buteo  jamaicensis). Predators may threaten many of the smaller, more isolated  populations of northern Idaho ground squirrel. Badger activity has been  noted at several of these sites (Sherman and Gavin 1997). Badgers are  efficient predators and could eliminate an entire population of 20 or  so animals in just a few days. Male ground squirrels, due to their  above-ground active behavior patterns, are particularly subject to  increased predation risk  [[Page 17783]]  during the mating period. Juveniles are also subject to a high degree  of predation during their first year (Sherman and Yensen 1994). Also,  domestic cat (Felis catus) predation has been documented at two sites  because the sites are located near residential housing (E. Yensen,  pers. comm. 1999).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The State of Idaho recognizes the northern Idaho ground squirrel as  a ``Species of Special Concern'' (Idaho Department of Fish and Game  1994). Because of this status, the northern Idaho ground squirrel is,  by State law, protected from taking (shooting, trapping, poisoning) or  possession. To date, however, protection from recreational shooting has  not been adequately enforced by the State, and the northern Idaho  ground squirrel remains vulnerable to this type of activity (Yensen  1985).     Local land use ordinances and other regulations are inadequate to  protect this subspecies. For example, in Adams County where 99 percent  of northern Idaho ground squirrel population sites are found, land use  regulations allow for single and multiple housing developments under a  permit system. There is no consideration under the existing permit  system for impacts that may result to northern Idaho ground squirrels  from housing or recreation developments in or adjacent to their  habitat. With no limitations on development of northern Idaho ground  squirrel habitat, it is anticipated that human population growth and  development in the foreseeable future will impact ground squirrel  sites.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence      Other factors affecting conservation actions for this subspecies  include land ownership patterns, prelisting activities, and  conservation efforts on private and public lands. All active northern  Idaho ground squirrel sites occur on private, State, and Payette  National Forest lands. A conservation agreement (Agreement) was  finalized in July 1996, between us and the Payette National Forest  (Service 1996). The duration of the Agreement is 5 years. The Agreement  identifies conservation and land management actions that will provide  habitat favorable to the northern Idaho ground squirrel. These actions,  some already in the implementation phase, include controlled burning of  selected meadows to reduce over-story and to improve forage preferred  by the northern Idaho ground squirrel, timber harvest in select areas  to open meadows where active sites are found, and timber harvest to  provide dispersal corridors for improved connectivity between active  populations (Forest Service 1998). For example, 3.3 million board feet  of timber is proposed for harvest in the Lick Creek drainage from 1998  to 2000 (Forest Service 1997b). The sale is designed to reconnect an  active population with other nearby populations. It will also expand  the size of 12 meadow habitats on Federal lands that are favorable to  recolonization by the northern Idaho ground squirrel. Two units were  completed in 1999, and the rest will be harvested in 2000. Although the  Agreement does not currently remove or reduce threats to the degree  where listing may be precluded, the conservation actions implemented  will facilitate recovery.     A relocation plan, developed by scientists from Cornell University  and Albertson College, was initiated in the spring of 1997, and  continued in 1998 and 1999. A total of 76 squirrels were transplanted  to 2 sites on lands managed by the Forest Service that had been treated  through burning and timber harvest (Sherman and Gavin 1997; Gavin et  al. 1998). One site had a small existing population of northern Idaho  ground squirrels, and at the other site, the subspecies had been  extirpated. Initial results indicate that some translocated females  were lactating, and juveniles were observed at both sites, indicating  successful reproduction (Sherman and Gavin 1997; Gavin et al. 1998). A  report compiling the results of monitoring the transplant is expected  in the spring of 2000. Whether long-term benefits to ground squirrel  recovery result from these actions will be unknown for several years.     Habitat and resource competition with the Columbian ground squirrel  is a factor affecting the survival of the northern Idaho ground  squirrel. Competition from the Columbian ground squirrel could be an  important factor in the decline of the northern Idaho ground squirrel  (Dyni and Yensen 1996). The northern Idaho ground squirrel may have  been forced into areas containing shallower soils due to competition  from Columbian ground squirrels (Sherman and Yensen 1994). The  Columbian ground squirrel is larger and prefers deeper areas with soils  that provide better over-winter protection and higher nutrients. Where  both subspecies occur, the northern Idaho ground squirrel tends to  occupy the shallower soils but requires deeper soils less than 1 m (3.2  ft) for nests (Yensen et al. 1991). The Columbian ground squirrel is  not restricted by soil depth; typically, their burrow systems are  associated with degree of slope, well-drained soils, and number of  native forbs (Weddell 1989).     Winter mortality may be a contributing factor for northern Idaho  ground squirrel decline, especially when juvenile squirrels enter  torpor without sufficient fat reserves and snow levels are below  average (Paul Sherman, pers. comm., 1997). Soils tend to freeze to  greater depths where snow levels are shallow. When this occurs, ground  squirrels are unable to thermoregulate or maintain sufficient fat  reserves. Although the relationship between ground squirrels and  weather is complex, (Yensen et al. 1992) sites may have been adversely  affected by drought and over winter mortality in the early 1990's.  Winter mortality is of special concern since many remaining sites  contain few individuals. High winter mortality combined with the loss  of suitable vegetation conditions can result in the permanent loss of  isolated populations.     As a result of the factors discussed above, and due to the small  population sizes at remaining sites and the low total number of  individuals, the northern Idaho ground squirrel may have little  resilience to naturally occurring events (Gavin et al. 1993). Small  populations are often highly vulnerable to natural climatic  fluctuations as well as catastrophic natural events (Mangel and Tier  1994). Gavin et al. (1993) used a computer population viability  simulation program (VORTEX), using natality (birth) and mortality  (death) values recorded over 8 years from an intensively studied  northern Idaho ground squirrel population (Sherman and Yensen 1994) to  examine population viability. Variables in the model included no  natural immigration. The population viability analysis used 50  individuals, a figure that was 30 individuals lower than the actual  population size of 80 individuals (Sherman and Yensen 1994). The model  calculated that all but 1 of 100 populations would become extinct in  less than 20 years.     In developing this rule, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the northern Idaho ground  squirrel. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the  northern Idaho ground squirrel as a threatened species. The subspecies  has declined from approximately 5,000 animals in 1985 to fewer than  1,000 animals in 1998. Although additional occupied sites have been  recently discovered, numerous extirpations have occurred. Most  remaining populations  [[Page 17784]]  consist of small numbers of individuals isolated from other  populations. Remaining occupied sites on private land are not protected  from threats to the species or its' habitat. Existing land use  regulations are inadequate to protect the northern Idaho ground  squirrel from habitat destruction resulting from development. Some  ground squirrel habitat improvement projects have been initiated at two  sites on Payette National Forest lands. While these efforts may be  important to the long-term conservation of the northern Idaho ground  squirrel, they are currently very limited in their applicability and  the threat of meadow loss still continues. Benefits to the northern  Idaho ground squirrel from current conservation actions may not be  realized or quantifiable for years. While the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is not in immediate danger of extinction because of ongoing  conservation efforts, the subspecies could become endangered in the  foreseeable future if remaining sites decline further. Not listing this  taxon would be inconsistent with the intent of the Act.  Critical Habitat      Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as: (i) The  specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at  the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found  those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation  of the species and (II) that may require special management  considerations or protection and; (ii) specific areas outside the  geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon  a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of  the species. ``Conservation'' means the use of all methods and  procedures needed to bring the species to the point at which listing  under the Act is no longer necessary.     In the proposed rule, we indicated that designation of critical  habitat was not prudent for the northern Idaho ground squirrel because  of a concern that publication of precise maps and descriptions of  critical habitat in the Federal Register could increase the  vulnerability of this species to incidents of shooting and other forms  of human activity. We also indicated that designation of critical  habitat was not prudent because we believed it would not provide any  additional benefit beyond that provided through listing as endangered.     In the last few years, a series of court decisions have overturned  Service determinations regarding a variety of species that designation  of critical habitat would not be prudent (e.g., Natural Resources  Defense Council v. U.S. Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d 1121 (9th  Cir. 1997); Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp. 2d  1280 (D. Hawaii 1998)). Based on the standards applied in those  judicial opinions, we have reexamined the question of whether critical  habitat for the northern Idaho ground squirrel would be prudent.     Due to the small number of populations, the northern Idaho ground  squirrel is vulnerable to shooting, colony destruction, or other  disturbance. We remain concerned that these threats might be  exacerbated by the publication of critical habitat maps and further  dissemination of locational information. We have examined the evidence  available for the northern Idaho ground squirrel, and have knowledge of  two separate incidents where northern Idaho ground squirrel colonies  were eliminated on private lands from poisoning and shooting. As stated  in threat factor D, northern Idaho ground squirrels are, by Idaho State  law, protected from taking (shooting, trapping, poisoning) or  possession, but protection from recreational shooting has not been  adequately enforced by the State, especially in those areas where  recreational shooting of nearby Columbian ground squirrels is popular.  However, we do not have any evidence that the publication of critical  habitat maps would provide additional location information that was not  already available and thus increase the threat to northern Idaho ground  squirrels from shooting and poisoning. Consequently, consistent with  applicable regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)(i)) and recent case law, at  this time we cannot make a finding that the identification of critical  habitat will increase the degree of threat to these species from taking  or other human activity.     In the case of this species, some benefits may result from  designation of critical habitat. The primary regulatory effect of  critical habitat is the section 7 requirement that Federal agencies  refrain from taking any action that destroys or adversely modifies  critical habitat. While a critical habitat designation for habitat  currently occupied by this species would not be likely to change the  section 7 consultation outcome because an action that destroys or  adversely modifies such critical habitat would also be likely to result  in jeopardy to the species, in some instances section 7 consultation  might be triggered only if critical habitat is designated. Examples  could include unoccupied habitat or occupied habitat that may become  unoccupied in the future. Designating critical habitat may also provide  some educational or informational benefits. Therefore, we find that  designation of critical habitat is prudent for the northern Idaho  ground squirrel.     As explained in detail in our Listing Priority Guidance for FY 2000  (64 FR 57114), our listing budget is currently insufficient to allow us  to immediately complete all of the listing actions required by the Act.  Deferral of the critical habitat designation for the northern Idaho  ground squirrel will allow us to concentrate our limited resources on  higher priority critical habitat and other listing actions, while  allowing us to put in place protections needed for the conservation of  the northern Idaho ground squirrel without further delay. However,  because we have successfully reduced, although not eliminated, the  backlog of other listing actions, we anticipate in FY 2000 and beyond  giving higher priority to critical habitat designation, including  designations deferred pursuant to the Listing Priority Guidance, such  as the designation for this species, than we have in recent fiscal  years.     We plan to employ a priority system for deciding which outstanding  critical habitat designations should be addressed first. We will focus  our efforts on those designations that will provide the most  conservation benefit, taking into consideration the efficacy of  critical habitat designation in addressing the threats to the species,  and the magnitude and immediacy of those threats. We will develop a  proposal to designate critical habitat for the northern Idaho ground  squirrel as soon as feasible, considering our workload priorities.  Unfortunately, for the immediate future, most of Region 1's listing  budget must be directed to complying with numerous court orders and  settlement agreements, as well as due and overdue final listing  determinations (like the one at issue in this case).  Available Conservation Measures      Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in  conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,  and individuals. Without the elevated profile that Federal listing  affords, little likelihood exists that any conservation activities  would be undertaken. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and  cooperation with the States and requires  [[Page 17785]]  that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The  protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against  taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR  part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to  confer with us on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued  existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse  modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed  subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that  activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency  must enter into formal consultation with us.     The Act requires the appropriate land management agencies to  evaluate potential impacts to the species that may result from  activities they authorize or permit. Consultation under section 7 of  the Act is required for activities on Federal, State, county, or  private lands that may impact the survival and recovery of the northern  Idaho ground squirrel, if such activities are funded, authorized,  carried out, or permitted by Federal agencies. Federal agencies that  may be involved with this subspecies include the Forest Service,  Federal Highway Administration, BLM, Office of Surface Mining, and  Natural Resource Conservation Service. Section 7 requires these  agencies to consider potential impacts to the northern Idaho ground  squirrel prior to approval of any activity authorized or permitted by  them.     Federal agency actions that may require consultation include  removing, thinning, or altering vegetation; constructing of roads or  camping sites in the vicinity of active and historical sites;  recreational home developments; off-road vehicle use areas; gravel or  sand mining activities; campground construction; mining permits and  expansion; highway construction; and timber harvest.     Listing this subspecies as threatened provides for development of a  recovery plan. Such a plan would identify both State and Federal  efforts for conservation of the subspecies and establish a framework  for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in  conservation efforts. The plan would set recovery priorities and  describe site-specific management actions necessary to achieve  conservation and survival of the subspecies. Additionally, pursuant to  section 6 of the Act, we would be able to grant funds to affected  States for management actions promoting the protection and recovery of  this subspecies.     The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 describe  general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all threatened  wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person  subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (including  harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect,  or attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate  or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or  offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It  also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship  any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions  apply to our agents and State conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances.  Regulations governing permits for threatened species are at 50 CFR  17.32. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance  the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take  in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species,  permits are also available for zoological exhibition, educational  purposes, or special purposes consistent with the purposes of the Act.     As published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34272),  our policy is to identify, to the maximum extent practicable at the  time when a species is proposed for listing, those activities that  would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The  intent of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of  the listing on proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range.  We believe that, based upon the best available information, the  following action will not likely result in a violation of section 9:     (1) Activities authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal  agencies (e.g., logging, flood and erosion control, mineral and housing  development, off-road vehicle permitting or park development,  recreational trail and campground development, road construction,  prescribed burns, pest control activities, utility lines or pipeline  construction) when such activity is conducted in accordance with any  incidental take statement prepared by us in accordance with section 7  of the Act; and     (2) Clearing of a firebreak around one's personal residence.     Activities that we believe could potentially result in a violation  of section 9 include but are not limited to:     (1) Activities that directly or indirectly result in the actual  death or injury of the northern Idaho ground squirrel, or that modify  the known habitat of the subspecies by significantly modifying  essential behavior patterns (e.g., intensive plowing and conversion to  cropland, shooting, intentional poisoning, road and trail construction,  water development and impoundment, mineral extraction or processing,  off-road vehicle use, and unauthorized application of herbicides or  pesticides);     (2) Activities within the northern Idaho ground squirrel  hibernating period (mid July through early April) and near burrow areas  that include road, pipeline, or utility construction, herbicide  application, or other activities that would alter the burrow systems  and food sources of the northern Idaho ground squirrel; and     (3) Activities authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal  agencies (e.g., logging, flood and erosion control, mineral and housing  development, off-road vehicle permitting or park development,  recreational trail and campground development, road construction,  prescribed burns, pest control activities, utility lines or pipeline  construction) when such activity is not conducted in accordance with  any incidental take statement prepared by us in accordance with section  7 of the Act.     Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a  violation of section 9 or requests to obtain approved guidelines for  actions within northern Idaho ground squirrel habitat should be  directed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Snake River Basin  Office, Boise, Idaho (see ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of  the regulations concerning listed animals and inquiries regarding  prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland,  Oregon 97232-4181 (telephone 503/231-2063; Facsimile 503/231-6243).  National Environmental Policy Act      We determined that we do not need to prepare an Environmental  [[Page 17786]]  Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the  authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in  connection with regulations adopted under section 4(a) of the  Endangered Species Act, as amended. A notice outlining our reasons for  this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25,  1983 (48 FR 49244).  Required Determinations      This rule does not contain any new collections of information other  than those already approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44  U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned Office of Management and Budget  clearance number 1018-0094. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a  person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless  it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

GX095-45-8639844	_doc_ _/doc_  [Federal Register: November 3, 2003 (Volume 68, Number 212)] [Notices]                [Page 62315-62316] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr03no03-66]                           -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  Fish and Wildlife Service    Southern Idaho Ground Squirrel Programmatic Candidate  Conservation Agreement With Assurances  AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.  ACTION: Notice of intent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, this notice  advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),  in cooperation with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) and  the Idaho Governor's Office of Species Conservation, intends to gather  information necessary to prepare an environmental document  (environmental assessment and/or environmental impact statement)  regarding a proposed Southern Idaho Ground Squirrel Programmatic  Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) and enhancement  of survival permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species  Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). The IDFG is the proposed permit  applicant.     The Service is furnishing this notice in order to: (1) Advise other  Federal and State agencies, affected tribes, and the public of our  intentions; (2) announce the initiation of a 21-day public scoping  period; and (3) to obtain suggestions and information on the scope of  issues to be addressed in the environmental document.  DATES: Written comments from all interested parties must be received on  or before November 24, 2003.  ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Carmen Thomas, Project  Biologist, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1387 S. Vinnell Way, Room  368, Boise, Idaho 83709; facsimile: (208) 378-5262.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carmen Thomas at the above address or  telephone: (208) 378-5243.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Candidate Conservation Agreements with  Assurances contain a strategy for covered lands and activities that  constitute an applicant's contribution to avoid listing or remove the  need to list a covered species as threatened or endangered under the  ESA. In return, an applicant receives assurances that it will not be  required to provide additional conservation measures if any of the  covered species become listed under the ESA in the future.     The proposed CCAA planning document would cover approximately  1,000,000 acres in Adams, Washington, Payette, and Gem Counties, Idaho;  within this area, individual non-Federal landowners could voluntarily  enroll lands under the proposed CCAA. It is unknown how many landowners  would participate and enroll lands under the CCAA, however, we expect  the acreage of enrolled lands to be substantially less than 1,000,000  acres.     The primary goal of the proposed CCAA would be to implement habitat  and population conservation measures on non-Federal lands enrolled  under the CCAA for the southern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus  brunneus endemicus). Habitat conservation measures would focus on  restoration or protection of native plant communities, including shrub/ steppe habitat, or other habitat management measures to benefit this  species. Other conservation measures could include: minimization of  impacts from land use activities in southern Idaho ground squirrel- occupied habitat to conserve ground squirrel populations; prohibition  of shooting, trapping, and poisoning of  [[Page 62316]]  southern Idaho ground squirrels; reintroduction of southern Idaho  ground squirrels into unoccupied suitable habitat; and authorization  for Service and IDFG personnel to access enrolled lands for purposes of  monitoring southern Idaho ground squirrel populations and habitat.  Potential covered activities include: crop cultivation and harvesting,  livestock grazing and production, farm equipment operation, and  recreational activities (e.g., hunting, fishing, camping, dog training,  and use of recreational vehicles on and off established roads).     The Service will conduct an environmental review of the proposed  CCAA and prepare an environmental document. The review will analyze the  CCAA, as well as a full range of reasonable alternatives, and the  associated impacts of each. Should information become available that  indicates significant environmental impacts from the proposed CCAA, an  Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared. Comments and  suggestions are invited from all interested parties to ensure the full  range of issues related to this proposed action are identified.  Comments or questions should be addressed to the Service at the address  or telephone number provided above. See ADDRESSES and FOR FURTHER  INFORMATION CONTACT.     The environmental review of this proposed project will be conducted  in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), National  Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), other  applicable Federal laws and regulations, and policies and procedures of  the Service for compliance with those regulations.

The proposed Program combines a number of proven control methods with regulatory quarantines. Citrus canker is a bacterial disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Hasse) Dawson. It can cause extensive damage to twigs, leaves, and fruit of susceptible citrus varieties often causing fruit to drop prematurely and to be unmarketable due to lesions on the peel. The bacteria that cause citrus canker can survive for extensive periods on citrus branches and bark. The disease is spread by wind; rain splash; mechanical activities, such as pruning, picking, and spraying carried out within and between groves; movement of infected plants or plant parts; and the activities of birds, insects, and/or mammals. Citrus canker threatens the citrus growing areas of the United States because of its rapid spread, high potential for damage, and impact on exports to foreign countries and interstate movement. The proposed Program will include the removal of infected trees and the treatment of stumps with trichlopyr. The trees and limbs will be burned or buried. For commercial groves, the burning or burning may be conducted on site or placed in a municipal landfill. For residential plantings, the removed plant material may be burned in municipal waste incinerators or placed in a municipal landfill. The herbicide trichlopyr will be applied directly to the stump by painting or spraying. It dries rapidly and is readily adsorbed by the stump. Environmental degradation occurs readily through photo degradation and microbial decomposition. Any trichlopyr that may reach the ground is not strongly adsorb to the soil particles, and it readily photo degrades. No run-off is anticipated (USDA/APHIS, 1999).  1   SPECIES ACCOUNTS MAMMALS  Florida Panther (Felis concolor coryi) Status: The Florida panther was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 (USDOI, FWS, 1967). Pertinent Species Information: The Florida panther is a medium-sized cat that is a subspecies of the more widespread Felis concolor. It is generally a solitary cat except during the breeding season (October to March). The gestation period is 90 to 95 days. The Florida panther ranges up to 310 square miles during a month. Its diet consists of rabbits, feral hogs, deer, and armadillos. The preferred habitat during the day is one that is heavily vegetated. At night, open areas that are good for hunting are preferred. The present threats to the Florida panther are low population numbers, increased human presence, diseases and predation, and reduced prey base (FWS, 1987). According to the FWS, the Florida panther occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The Florida panther prefers remote habitats that contain heavy vegetation, such as swamp forests, hardwood hammock, and oak pine woodlands. These habitat types are not part of the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Florida panther.  West Indian (=Florida) Manatee (Trichechus manatus) Status: The West Indian manatee was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967, and June 2, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1967, and USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Critical habitat has been designated (50 CFR Part 17.95(a)). Pertinent Species Information: The West Indian manatee is a massive, fusiform, thick-skinned nearly hairless marine mammal with paddle-like forelimbs, no hindlimbs, and a spatulate, horizontally flattened tail. Calving probably occurs throughout the year because small calves are seen every month. The female (cow) usually mates with several bulls during her brief period of receptivity. The gestation period is estimated to be 365 to 400 days. Manatees are known to eat many kinds of plants, preferring submergents to surface-floating and emergent vegetation. The habitat of manatees consists of brackish waters, lagoons, and mouths of rivers. The species cannot tolerate water temperatures below 46 degrees, and movements  2   have been documented to warmer waters in Florida during cold periods. Turbidity seems to have no effect on the species, and animals can tolerate extremely muddy waters. The manatee typically ranges from Beaufort, North Carolina, south to the Florida Keys and along the Gulf of Mexico (Burt and Grossenheider, 1964). In 1994, the species was detected as far north as in the Chesapeake Bay of Maryland. The entire State of Florida has been designated as a refuge and a sanctuary for the manatee, and federally designated critical habitat extended from Jacksonville on the Atlantic, along the coast in inland waterways, to Crystal River on the Gulf Coast (50 CFR Part 17.95 (a)). The manatee was hunted extensively in the 18th and 19th Centuries. The present major threat to manatees is strikes by power boats (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). . According to the FWS, the West Indian manatee occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The aquatic habitat of the manatee excludes it from being in close proximity to the Program area. Therefore, APHIS had determined that the Program will have no effect on the West Indian manatee or its critical habitat.  BIRDS  Audubon's Crested Caracara (Polyborus plancus audubonii) Status: The Audubon crested caracara was listed as threatened on July 6, 1987 (USDOI, FWS, 1987c). Pertinent Species Information: The Audubon crested caracara is a hawk of open country. Dry prairies with wetter areas and scattered cabbage palm constitute the typical habitat. Adults maintain large territories, usually with their mates. Pair bonds are strong, apparently lasting until one mate dies. The breeding peak is from January to March, and two to three eggs are laid in a nest made of slender vines and sticks, which is usually located in a cabbage palm. Incubation lasts about 32 days, and the young leave the nest at about 8 weeks of age. The family group usually remains together for 2 or 3 months after the young fledge.  Audubon crested caracaras are opportunistic feeders. Their diet consists of both carrion and living prey. The living prey is largely small turtles and turtle eggs, but it also eats insects, fish, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds, and small mammals. Threats to the caracara are habitat loss due to conversion to citrus groves, tree  3   plantations, improved pastures, other agricultural uses, and real estate development. The current number of breeding birds is low relative to most other large raptors in Florida. The caracara is a long lived bird with a low reproductive rate that uses widely dispersed territories. It is susceptible to natural or human caused catastrophes, such as hurricanes and poisoning from pesticides (USDOI, FWS, 1987c). According to the FWS, the Audubon crested caracara occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Hendry, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The Program area would not include the habitat of the caracara. Therefore, APHIS determined that the Program will have no effect on the Audubon crested caracara.  Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) Status: The bald eagle was listed as endangered throughout the lower 48 States on March 11, 1967 (USDOI, FWS, 1967). The species was reclassified as threatened in Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan on February 14, 1978 (USDOI, FWS, 1978b). A reclassification to threatened status in all of the lower 48 States was finalized July 12, 1995 (USDOI, FWS, 1995), and a proposal for delisting occurred on July 6, 1999 (USDOI, FWS, 1999). Pertinent Species Information: Bald eagles are large raptors that mate for life. Breeding starts at age 4 to 5. They inhabit riparian habitats: rivers, coasts, and lakes. Bald eagles are opportunistic feeders eating a variety of living and dead (carrion) prey. The preferred diet is fish. Nesting sites are usually within 1 to 2 miles of water, in the largest living tree in a stand and with an open view of the surrounding area. Eagles are territorial during the breeding season, which begins in October; they defend an average territory size of 57 acres and establish a platform nest of sticks in a tall tree or cliff. A female bald eagle lays 2 eggs; incubation usually lasts 35 days. Ten to 12 weeks are needed for fledging. Nestlings usually fledge by mid-March; however, nesting activities sometimes carry on into June (FWS, 1989). The decline of the bald eagle has been attributed to the use of DDT. DDT and its metabolites caused eggshell thinning, which lead to nesting failure (USDOI, FWS, 1995).  According to the FWS, the bald eagle occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: Impacts to the eagle would be those associated with disturbance during the breeding period. Nesting and fledging will be completed prior to Program implementation. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the bald eagle.  4   Everglade Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) Status: The Everglade snail kite was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 (USDOI, FWS, 1967). Critical habitat was designated in 1977 (50 CFR Part 17.95 (b)). Pertinent Species Information: The Everglade snail kite is a medium-sized hawk whose preferred habitat is extensive areas of shallow open surface water, such as sloughs and wet prairies, that retain some water throughout most years and usually for several successive years. These areas must have emergent vegetation to support populations of the apple snail. Such plant communities are normally situated in a larger marsh of sawgrass or cattails with only scattered shrubs, small trees, and tree islands. Flooding of marshes is necessary to sustain an adequate snail supply. The apple snail is the kite's primary food source. The kite has been observed eating rice rats, small turtles of several species, and two other aquatic snails. However, these are eaten when snail kites are unavailable or scarce. Nesting occurs every month, but Kites nest over water in trees or not available. The clutch size is can occur following the loss of a occurs early in the season. the main nesting season is January through August. shrubs; cattails are used when trees and shrubs are three and does not vary between years. Renesting nest, plus there is double brooding when nesting  Threats to the Everglade snail kite started in the early 1900's and continues with the drainage of south Florida's wetlands for agricultural use and residential development. The increased demand for fresh water, the degradation of water quality, and the invasion of exotics, such as water hyacinth and Australian punktree, also is a continuing threat. Nesting success is comparatively low ranging from 0 to 10 percent when water levels are low to 50 percent when water levels are high (FWS, 1986a). According to the FWS, the Everglade snail kite occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The habitat of the kite would not be the same as the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Everglade snail kite or its critical habitat.  Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Status: The piping plover was listed on December 11, 1985 (USDOI, FWS, 1985b). The listing designated the population breeding in the Great Lakes watershed as endangered and the populations breeding along the Atlantic Coast and in the northern Great Plains as threatened. Critical habitat has been proposed (USDOI, FWS, 2000). Pertinent Species Information: Piping plovers are migratory shorebirds. They arrive in their northern breeding grounds in April or May and most leave the nesting grounds in 5   August. Four eggs are usually laid in the second or third week of May in a scrape in the sand, which is lined with pebbles or shell fragments. The breeding grounds are north of the Program; however, this species winters (from late July through early May) along the Gulf Coast (Texas to Florida) and eastern seaboard (from Georgia south). Their winter habitat is beaches and sandflats, from which they pick or probe marine worms, crustaceans, insects, and mollusks (Bent, 1962; FWS, 1988). The threats to this species occur mostly on the breeding grounds, which include sandy beaches of the Atlantic (from North Carolina northward), inland areas around the Great Lakes, and potholes and rivers of the northern prairies. These habitats are highly disturbed by recreational activities, development, water projects, or natural phenomena that cause fluctuations in river or lake levels. However, coastal development throughout the range has undoubtedly negatively affected this species, as it is easily disturbed by humans and their pets (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the piping plover occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The coastal habitat of the plover would not be the same as the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the piping plover or its proposed critical habitat.  Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) Status: The Florida scrub jay was listed as threatened on June 3, 1987 (USDOI, FWS, 1987b). Pertinent Species Information: The Florida scrub jay is a 12 inch bird that is restricted to scrub habitat areas of Florida that consists of dense thickets of scrub oaks less than 10 feet in height interspersed with bare sand for foraging and storing acorns. Such areas occur along the Atlantic coast, the dunes in Lake Wales Ridge, and in Ocala National Forest.  The Florida scrub jay eats about anything it can catch, but it concentrates on lizards and arthropods in spring and summer and acorns in fall and winter. Excess acorns are frequently cashed in the ground. These birds are long-lived (about 10 years) and are monogamous. They nest from late February to early June. The raising of a brood is assisted by the older young, both males and females. Males assist for up to 7 years, whereas females assist the parents for about 2 years. The major threat to the Florida scrub jay is habitat destruction. Other threats are shooting by vandals and road kills (USDOI, FWS, 1987b). According to the FWS, the Florida scrub jay occurs in the Program counties of Collier, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. 6   Program Assessment: The habitat of the scrub jay is not the same as the Program area. Therefore, APHIS determined that the Program will have no effect on the Florida scrub jay.  Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) Status: The Cape Sable seaside sparrow was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 (USDOI, FWS, 1967). Critical habitat has been designated (50 CFR 17.95(b)). Pertinent Species Information: The Cape Sable seaside sparrow is a medium sized, non-migratory sparrow that lives in freshwater and brackish marshes and flooded prairies. It eats soft-bodied insects (grasshoppers, spiders, moths, caterpillars, beetles, dragonflies, wasps), marine worms, shrimp grass, and sedge seeds. Breeding can three broods the ground in young spend take place from late February a season if weather conditions grasses. Three to 4 eggs are 9 to 11 days in the nest. Both to early August with one or two and possibly allow. A cup nest is built about 5 inches off laid, incubation take 12 to 13 days, and the parents rear and feed the young.  Threats to the sparrow include the invasion of native and exotic trees, hydrologic changes, and predations from raccoons, snakes, rice rats, and hawks (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, and Dade. Program Assessment: The scrub habitat of the sparrow would not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Cape Sable seaside sparrow or its critical habitat.  Wood Stork (Mysteria americana) Status: The wood stork was listed as endangered on February 28, 1984 (USDOI, FWS, 1984a). Pertinent Species Information: The wood stork is a large, long-legged wading bird with a white body; a gray, naked head; and a dark, thick bill (USDOI, FWS, 1984a). The wood stork builds a platform nest of large sticks lined with leaves in the tops of cypress trees. Storks are very colonial, with 5 to 25 nests per tree. They lay two to five eggs and fledge two young in a year of abundant prey (Ehrlich, et al., 1988). Their diet consists of small fish, such as topminnows and sunfish. The stork requires a high concentration of prey. It probes the water with its beak partially open, and if a fish touches it, the bill reflexively snaps shut. The stork prefers fresh water, brackish wetlands, and cypress and mangrove swamps. 7   Depressions in these marshes, where fish become concentrated in dry periods, are the preferred feeding areas. The wood stork often ranges as far as 80 miles from nesting to feeding areas. Breeding populations of the species are presently restricted to Florida, Georgia, and marginally South Carolina. Reproductive failures are primarily from feeding problems caused by water management in south Florida. Water levels in these swamps remain too high for the stork to feed properly. Nest failures have even been reported in protected areas, such as the Everglades (FWS, 1986b). According to the FWS, the wood stork occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The nesting areas of the wood stork would not be included in the Program area. However, the feeding areas, up to 80 miles from the nesting areas, could be near the Program area. The cutting of citrus trees would have no effect on the stork and the treating of stumps is not expected to create any run-off of the chemical. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the wood stork.  Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) Status: The northeast population of the roseate tern was listed as endangered, and the Caribbean population was listed as threatened on November 2, 1987 (USDOI, FWS, 1987d). Pertinent Species Information: The roseate tern is a dove-sized (about 15 inches long) coastal bird that feeds mainly on small schooling marine fish, which it captures by plunging headfirst into the water (USDOI, FWS, 1987d). The terns that nest in the northeastern United States winter from western Columbia to eastern Brazil. Most of the Caribbean birds probably winter further to the south (FWS, 1999). The birds migrate into Florida in late April or early May. Nests are built on the ground on isolated islands, rubble islets, and dredge-spoil. Some roseate terns have nested on roof tops. A few terns will nest at age 2, but the usual age is 3 to 4. Eggs are laid in May with downy chicks hatching in June. The clutch size for the Caribbean population is between 1.31 to 1.71 eggs per nest. Both sexes incubate, brood, and feed the young (FWS, 1999). The nesting populations in North America and the Caribbean are very small and localized and occur only along marine coasts. Abandonment of nesting sites is due to predation by nocturnal-feeding mammals and competition with gulls for nesting space. Threats to the roseate tern include habitat loss and modification, predation and competition (USDOI, FWS, 1987d), and human interference during nesting (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the roseate tern occurs in the Program counties of Broward, 8   Dade, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The Program area will not include the coastal habitat of the tern. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the roseate tern.  Bachman's (Wood) Warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) Status: The Bachman's warbler was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 and June 2, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1967, and USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Pertinent Species Information: The Bachman's warbler is a small migratory songbird that winters in Cuba and the Isle of Pines and migrates to the Southeast United States in mid-March to breed. Breeding has been documented in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. It does not breed in Florida but transits through during migration. The habitat requirements during migration are variable, but floodplain forests are an important habitat. The habitat requirements for nesting warblers is typically low, wet, forested areas containing variable amounts of water but usually some permanent water. The warbler builds a cup-shaped nest near the ground out of dried leaves, weeds, and grass stalks and lines it with Spanish moss. The clutch size is thought to be three to four eggs. Evidence suggests that the species is particularly adapted to swampy canebreaks or bamboo thickets. This warbler forages in dense foliage high in trees and an insect diet, similar to other Vermivora, is suspected. The last sighting of the Bachman's warbler in Florida was reported in 1977 near Melbourne. The last confirmed sighting in the United States was in Louisiana in 1988. The last sighting in Cuba was in 1981. The species was hunted for its feathers, and its decline also may be tied to the decrease in the canebreak habitat. Much of this habitat has been cleared for agriculture (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Bachman's warbler could occur in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: Since there have been no recent sightings of this bird in the United States, APHIS determined that the Program will have no effect on the Bachman's warbler.  Kirtland's Warbler (=Wood) (Dendroica kirtlandii) Status: The Kirtland's warbler was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 and June 2, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1967 and USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Pertinent Species Information: The Kirtland's warbler is a small songbird, approximately 5 to 7 inches, whose primary diet consists of insects (moths, caterpillars, adult ant lions, and numerous insects), but it does feed on tree sap and blueberries. It 9   is a migratory bird that is present in Michigan from April to August/September at which time it nests. It builds a typical cup nest in the soil and lays 4 to 5 eggs in June that incubate 26 to 28 days. Nesting occurs in central Michigan in the Au Sable River watershed in Crawford, Oscoda, and Ogemaw Counties. The habitat requirements for nesting are distinctive. They require Jack pines at least 7 feet tall and up to 20 feet tall with low ground cover. This habitat type was achieved when forest fires were not minimized. When the Jack pines grow larger than 16 to 20 feet tall with no lower branches, the warbler will not nest in the area. A tract must be at least 80 acres and preferably 200+ acres to attract the warbler. Another specific nesting habitat requirement is the presence of Grayling sand, which quickly drains during summer downpours and prevents nest flooding. The Kirtland's warbler migrates through Florida on its way to and from its wintering habitat in the Bahama Islands, other Caribbean Islands (Grand Turks and Caicos Islands and the Dominican Republic), and maybe Cuba. The wintering habitat requirements are not well known, but from January through April it is associated with desert-like vegetation of deciduous shrubs and Caribbean pine ecosystem. The major threats to the Kirtland's warbler are habitat destruction and nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothras ater) (FWS, 1991; FWS, 1976). According to the FWS, the Kirtland's warbler occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The warbler is present in the Program area for a short period of time as it migrates through in the fall and spring. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Kirtland's warbler.  Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) Status: The ivory-billed woodpecker was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967, and June 2, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1967, and USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Pertinent Species Information: The ivory-billed woodpecker is the largest North American woodpecker reaching a length of 19.5 inches. It excavates a cavity in trees about 30 feet off the ground for nesting (World Wildlife Fund, 1990), which occurs from January to May (FWS, 1991). A clutch of 2 to 3 eggs are incubated for about 20 days. Young fledge in about 35 days. This woodpecker forages on the larvae of engraver beetles that live just under the bark of dead or dying trees (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). Fruits, nuts, and seed are also occasionally eaten (FWS, 1991). The ivory-billed woodpecker requires large tracts of forest to survive - up to 2,000 acres for each pair. It inhabits bottomland, cypress swamps, and uncut long-leaf pine forests. The last confirmed observation in the United States was in Louisiana on the Tennsas River National Wildlife Refuge. A survey was recently conducted to search for this woodpecker and, no birds were located. Areas that may still have habitat for the ivorybilled woodpeckers include: the Atchafalaya Basin (Louisiana), the Santee River (South Carolina), the Altamaha River (Georgia), the Yazoo and Pascagoula Rivers 10   (Mississippi), and the Suwannee, Withlacoochee, and Ochloconee Rivers (Florida). It was observed in Cuba in 1986. Two additional expeditions, 1991 and 1993, took place with no ivory-billed woodpeckers observed (Lammertink, 1995). Threats to the species are from logging and over hunting of the adults (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the ivory-billed woodpecker could occur in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: Due to the forest habitat of this bird and since there have been no recent sightings of this woodpecker in the United States, APHIS determined that the Program will have no effect on the ivory-billed woodpecker.  Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides (=Dendrocopos) borealis) Status: The red-cockaded woodpecker was listed as endangered on October 13, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1970b). Pertinent Species Information: The red-cockaded woodpecker is a small bird about 7 to 8 inches long. This woodpecker excavates nest cavities in living pine trees, sometimes infected by redheart disease. These birds are strongly territorial and live in a family unit, or clan, of 5 to 10 birds, consisting of a breeding pair and unmated young. Nesting occurs in April and May, with a clutch size of two to five eggs. Incubation lasts about 10 days, and juveniles remain in the parents' home range through the summer and into the fall. The red-cockaded woodpecker is a habitat specialist, nesting in open stands of pines a minimum of 60 years old. They keep numerous small ""wells"" of sap running around the entrance to the cavity as a defense mechanism against nest predators, such as snakes. They feed on surface and subsurface arthropods. A colony requires an average of 200 acres. Loss of old-growth stands of long-leaf and loblolly pine to logging, development, and improper management are major threats to the red-cockaded woodpecker (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to FWS, the red-cockaded woodpecker occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Hendry, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The forested habitat of the woodpecker is not the habitat included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the red-cockaded woodpecker.  REPTILES American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) 11   Status: The American crocodile was listed as endangered on September 25, 1975 (USDOI, FWS, 1975). Critical habitat has been designated (50 CFR 17.95(c)). Pertinent Species Information: The American crocodile is a reptile that lives in the coastal mangrove swamps, salt and brackish bays, and brackish creeks of southern Florida. The adults eat fish, crabs, birds, turtles, snakes, and small mammals. The young feed chiefly on aquatic invertebrates and small fish. The crocodile breeds in the southern portion of the Everglades National Park, chiefly in Florida Bay, and outside the park at Key Largo and Turkey Point. Nest construction occurs in April, 20 to 60 eggs are laid in late April to early May, and hatching occurs from July to August. Nesting occurs in hardwood thickets at the head of small sand beaches and banks along narrow coastal creeks (FWS, 1991). Crocodiles are active and forage from shortly before sunset to shortly after sunrise (FWS, 1999). Threats to the crocodile include loss of habitat to urbanization, human disturbance, intentional killing (FWS, 1991), including hunting for hides (FWS, 1999), accidental deaths from commercial fishing nets and highway collisions, predation of eggs by raccoons, and a decrease in the amount of freshwater available to the hatchlings that cannot tolerate as much salinity as adults (FWS, 1991). According to the FWS, the American crocodile occurs in the Program counties of Collier and Dade. Program Assessment: The coastal habitat of the crocodile will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the American crocodile or its critical habitat.  Sea Turtles The following five sea turtles are all marine organisms, except when nesting on beaches. The potential impacts due to Program activities are the same for all five species. For this reason, the Program assessment for the green sea turtle, the hawksbill sea turtle, the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, the leatherback sea turtle, and the loggerhead sea turtle has been combined and follows the species accounts of the five sea turtles.  Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas) Status: The green sea turtle was listed as endangered on July 28, 1978, (USDOI, FWS, 1978c). Pertinent Species Information: Green sea turtles spend most of their lives feeding on sea grasses and algae along the Continental Shelf. They migrate long distances and return to the same beaches at intervals of 2 to 4 years to nest. In the United States, the green sea turtles nest from June through August. Nesting occurs in North Carolina, 12   Georgia, and Florida. Nesting beaches need to be relatively undisturbed by humans and predators, and they must have stable temperatures and moisture for the 48 to 70 days of incubation. The females crawl ashore at night and lay 100 to 200 eggs. The threats to the green sea turtle include development of beaches, hunting for their meat, poaching of the eggs, and drowning as a result of being caught in shrimp nets. The State of Florida is working to preserve the nesting areas, and the National Marine Fisheries Service has regulations (50 CFR Part 227) requiring the use of turtle excluder devices (TED's) on larger shrimp boats in both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the green sea turtle occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach.  Hawksbill Sea Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) Status: The hawksbill sea turtle was listed as endangered on June 2, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Critical habitat has been designated in Puerto Rico (50 CFR 17.95(c) and 226.71). Pertinent Species Information: The hawksbill is one of the smaller of the sea turtles. Mature turtles grow to a length of 2 feet and weigh 100 pounds. The name ""hawksbill"" is derived from the turtle's prominent hooked beak. The hawksbill sea turtle is primarily carnivorous feeding on jellyfish, sponges, and other sedentary organisms near coral reefs. The species does not migrate and occupies a small range. In tropical waters, the turtle breeds year-round, and the species tends to nest alone. The female will scoop out a nest in an isolated, undisturbed, sandy beach area and deposit about 160 eggs, which incubate in about 50 days. Currently found throughout the world in tropical seas, the hawksbill sea turtle represents two distinct subspecies in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. No population estimates exist. The hawksbill is pelagic and spends most of its time in the open ocean (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the hawksbill sea turtle occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, and Palm Beach.  Kemp's (=Atlantic) Ridley Sea Turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) Status: The Kemp's ridley sea turtle was listed as endangered on June 2, 1970, (USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Pertinent species information: Although the Kemp's ridley sea turtle may reach 70 to 100 pounds in weight, it is the smallest member of the sea turtle family Chelonidae. The species is a migratory species inhabiting the open waters for much of the year 13   before returning to land for the nesting season. The species has a high reproductive potential, and each nesting female may lay about 100 eggs during multiple nestings during a year. Kemp's ridley sea turtles nest on rock-strewn beaches where primary vegetation grows along the berm and dunes are vegetated with a climax community of shrubs and small trees. Almost the entire nesting population of these turtles is found in the Playo del Rancho Nuevo, in the State of Tamaulipas, Mexico. A few nestings were recorded on Padre Island, Texas, but such sightings are rare. The species' primary sea habitat is  the Gulf of Mexico, but juveniles have been found along the eastern coast of the United States from Florida to Cape Cod. The Kemp's ridley sea turtle is primarily carnivorous, and its favorite food is the blue crab. The factors affecting the decline of this sea turtle are predation, poaching, and drowning caused by entanglement in shrimp nets. The nesting beach in Mexico is now protected by patrols to prevent poaching, and the eggs are moved to predator-proof hatcheries. The use of TED's (50 CFR Part 227) in both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico will have a positive effect on the Kemp's ridley sea turtle (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the Kemp's ridley sea turtle occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, and Palm Beach.  Leatherback Sea Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) Status: The leatherback sea turtle was listed as endangered on June 2, 1970 (USDOI, FWS, 1970a). Critical habitat has been designated in the Virgin Islands (50 CFR 17.95(c) and 226.71). Pertinent Species Information: The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle in the world and is known to migrate great distances. It spends most of its adult life in the open ocean, entering shallow waters only at breeding time. It eats twice its body weight of jellyfish each day with supplements of soft-bodied creatures. The United States nesting beaches include barrier islands in south central Florida from Vero Beach to Boca Raton. The other nesting area is on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nesting begins in March and continues until July. The females come ashore at night and lay about 35 eggs. The eggs incubate approximately 60 days before hatching. The major threats to the leatherback sea turtle include destruction of nesting beaches; hunting for food and oil; swallowing plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish; and drowning when caught in shrimp nets. The use of TED's (50 CFR Part 227) and the preservation  14   of nesting beaches will help conserve the species (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the leatherback sea turtle occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, and, Palm Beach.  Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta) Status: The loggerhead sea turtle was listed as threatened on July 28, 1978 (USDOI, FWS, 1978c). Pertinent Species Information: The loggerhead sea turtle is carnivorous and has strong jaws to crush heavy-shelled mollusks and crustaceans. From May to August adult females lay an average of two clutches of eggs at 13-day intervals. Each clutch size is approximately 120 eggs. The eggs incubate for 2 months, with the hatchlings emerging, usually at night, and making their way to the ocean. The females require well-drained dunes, clean sand, and grassy vegetation for nesting. The factors affecting the decline of the loggerhead sea turtle are habitat destruction, predation, and drowning from being caught in shrimp nets. The States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida are taking steps to prevent beach destruction and predation, and the Atlantic and Gulf shrimpers are using TED's (50 CFR Part 227) to prevent drowning (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the loggerhead sea turtle occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The beach habitat of the sea turtle when nesting is not the habitat included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the green sea turtle, the hawksbill sea turtle, the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, the leatherback sea turtle, or the loggerhead sea turtle. Critical habitat is not within the Program area.  Atlantic Salt Marsh Snake (Nerodia fasciata taeniata) Status: The Atlantic salt marsh snake was listed as threatened on November 29, 1977 (USDOI, FWS, 1977). Pertinent Species Information: The Atlantic salt marsh snake is a small, slender snake that inhabits coastal salt marshes and mangrove swamps that vary in salinity from brackish to full strength seawater. When they are in the brackish tidal marshes, they are most often found in association with saltwort flats and salt grass-bordered tidal  15   creeks. They can be active at any time, and the activity is strongly influenced by tidal cycles and availability of food. This snake feeds primarily on small fish, but it will eat frogs when available. They are ovoviviparous (eggs hatch within the female's body) and give birth to 3 to 9 young between August and October.  The snake is threatened by habitat loss and alterations due to intensive drainage and development plus the potential hybridization with adjacent freshwater snakes (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Atlantic salt marsh snake occurs in the Program county of Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The aquatic habitat of the snake is not included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Atlantic salt marsh snake.  Eastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon corais couperl) Status: The eastern indigo snake was listed as threatened on January 31, 1978 (USDOI, FWS, 1978a). Pertinent Species Information: The eastern indigo snake attains a length of approximately 8 feet and has a lustrous black body. It has a wide diet, which includes fish, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, turtle eggs, small alligators, birds, and small mammals. The snake is not territorial and may cover a wide range, depending on the season. During the winter (December through April), the species inhabits a range of about 19.5 acres; in the spring and summer its range increases to an average of 225.8 acres by late summer (FWS, 1982). The snake often takes refuge in the abandoned summer nesting burrows of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) when that species moves to its winter habitat. This habitat tends to be characterized by dry, sandy ridges. The loss of habitat through increased urbanization and agricultural development has contributed to the population decline of the eastern indigo snake. Habitat fragmentation has isolated snake populations and increased highway mortality. The decline of the gopher tortoise, also a threatened species, has reduced the area of the snake's potential habitat by decreasing the number of sandy ridge burrows available for winter refuge (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the eastern indigo snake occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The eastern indigo snake could occur throughout the Program  16   area. However, the cutting of trees and the treating of stumps should have no direct or indirect effects on the snake. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the eastern indigo snake.  FISH Gulf Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhynchus desotoi) Status: The Gulf sturgeon was listed as a threatened species on September 30, 1991 (USDOI, FWS, 1991). Pertinent Species Information: The Gulf sturgeon is a large nearly cylindrical subspecies of the Atlantic sturgeon (A. oxyrhynchus). It is a bottom-feeding species that primarily eats invertebrates, including brachiopods, insect larvae, mollusks, worms, and crustaceans. Most adult feeding occurs in the Gulf of Mexico and its estuaries. As an anadromous species, however, reproduction occurs in freshwater in February with individuals probably breeding in the same river system in which they hatched. Spawning occurs in areas of deep water with clean rock gravel or sand bottoms. The Gulf sturgeon is a slow-maturing, long-lived fish; females require 8 to 12 years to reach sexual maturity, while males need 7 to 10 years. The present range of the Gulf sturgeon is primarily found along the Florida coast. The Suwannee River contains the healthiest remaining population of Gulf sturgeon, but the species also has been identified in Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana; the Mobile River system in Alabama; and the Pascagoula and Pearl Rivers in Mississippi. This species inhabits large freshwater rivers from late winter through fall, is only transitory in coastal waters, and spends the winter in offshore marine waters. The primary factor in the decline of the Gulf sturgeon has been the impoundment of the major rivers and their tributaries that restrict upstream migration and destroys spawning habitat. Dredging, desnagging, and the deposit of dredging spoils conducted for channel improvement and maintenance also may degrade the species' preferred spawning habitat (World Wildlife Fund, 1990). According to the FWS, the Gulf sturgeon occurs in the Program counties of Hillsborough and Manatee. Program Assessment: No run-off from stump treatments is anticipated. Thus, the habitat of the sturgeon will not be affected. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Gulf sturgeon.  17   INSECTS Schaus Swallowtail Butterfly (Heraclides (=Papilio) aristodemus ponceanus) Status: The Schaus swallowtail butterfly was listed as threatened on April 28, 1976 (USDOI, FWS, 1976). It was reclassified as endangered on August 31, 1984 (USDOI, FWS, 1984b). Pertinent Species Information: The Schaus swallowtail butterfly lives in subtropical dry forests (hardwood hammocks) in southern Miami-Dade County through the Keys. Adults feed on the nectar from blossoms of guava, wild tamarind, and cheese shrub. Larvae feed on the tender new growth of torchwood and wild lime (FWS, 1991). Adults prefer shady habitat for feeding and oviposition, while the larvae are more commonly found on host plants that grow in open areas. Schaus swallowtails have a single annual flight season, primarily in May and June, where adults are active (FWS, 1999). Most reproduction is correlated with the beginning of the rainy season, April to June. This seems to trigger the emergence of adults. Eggs are deposited on the top of torchwood and wild lime, where the plants are not in open sunlight (FWS, 1999). Eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days and at the age of 20 days the larvae enter their last (fourth) molt. The pupal stage remains dormant for 1 to 2 years. Adults live for about 1 month (FWS, 1991). Threats to the butterfly are habitat loss, aerial application of insecticides, over-collecting (FWS, 1996), and extreme climactic conditions, such as hurricanes, freezes, and droughts (FWS, 1991). According to the FWS, the butterfly occurs in the Program county of Dade. Program Assessment: The habitat of the butterfly will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Schaus Swallowtail butterfly.  PLANTS Florida Golden Aster (Chrysopsis (=Heterotheca) floridana) Status: The Florida golden aster was listed as endangered on May 16, 1986 (USDOI, FWS, 1986a). Pertinent Species Information: The Florida golden aster is a perennial herb that occurs in sand pine and oak scrub or in disturbed areas at the edge of scrub habitat. It  18   flowers in late November and December and sheds seed from December onward. It can spread vegetatively, but reproduction is primarily by seed. Seedling emergence is enhanced by disturbances, such as rooting by armadillos or the presence of an ant mound. The disturbed soil of a gopher tortoise burrow also provides suitable soil for germination. The aster has been reintroduced into several locations. Threats to the Florida golden aster include residential and commercial development, mowing, intense grazing, and off-road vehicles (ORV's) (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Florida golden aster occurs in the Program county of Hillsborough. The Multi-Species Recovery Plan for South Florida includes Manatee County as a county of occurrence (FWS, 1999). Program Assessment: The scrub habitat of the aster will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Florida golden aster.  Florida Perforate Cladonia (Cladonia perforata) Status: The Florida perforate cladonia was listed as endangered on April 27, 1993 (USDOI, FWS, 1993a). Pertinent Species Information: The Florida perforate cladonia is a lichen that occurs in high, well-drained sands of rosemary scrub. They typically occur in open patches of sand between shrubs in areas with sparse or no herbaceous cover. They form mats that can be composed of only Florida perforate cladonia or a mixture with other species of Cladonia or Cladina. The branches are developmentally derived from sporeproducing structures rather than from the vegetative body of the lichen. It is suspected that this lichen reproduces only by vegetative fragmentation; no spore-producing organs have been described. Threats to the cladonia include loss of scrub habitat, trampling, ORV's, hurricane washover, and improper land management (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Florida perforate cladonia occurs in the Program county of Palm Beach. The Multi-Species Recovery Plan for South Florida includes Manatee County as a county of occurrence (FWS, 1999). Program Assessment: The scrub habitat of the cladonia will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Florida perforate cladonia.  Okeechobee Gourd (Cucurbita okeechobeensis ssp. okeechobeensis)  19   Status: The Okeechobee gourd was listed as endangered on July 12, 1993 (USDOI, FWS, 1993b). Pertinent Species Information: The Okeechobee gourd is an annual or perennial vine that will climb any plant that provides a trellis. The plants that are most closely associated with the gourd are elderberry and buttonbush. Around Lake Okeechobee, the gourd is frequently associated with alligator nests. These disturbed sites provide elevated areas and the preferred support plants. Seeds germinate in early spring during the dry season. The plant then produces flowers in the spring, and fruits, which are gourds, are most visible by early to midsummer. Based upon closely related gourds, the pollinators of the Okeechobee gourd could include bees, flies, and squash beetles. Marsh rabbits may be the main terrestrial dispersal agent. It also is suggested that the gourds are dispersed by floating in canals. Threats to the Okeechobee gourd include the conversion of swamp forests to agriculture, prolonged changes in the water level, the introduction of the exotics, such as Melaleuca and the Australian pine, and the use of herbicides for vegetation management (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Okeechobee gourd occurs in the Program county of Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The swamp habitat of the gourd will not be part of the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Okeechobee gourd.  Beach Jacquemontia (Jacquemontia reclinata) Status: The beach jacquemontia was listed as endangered on November 24, 1993 (USDOI, FWS, 1993c). Pertinent Species Information: The beach jacquemontia is a perennial vine that requires open areas typically found on the crest and lee sides of stable dunes. It also invades and restabilizes maritime hammocks or coastal strand communities that have been disturbed. It flowers from November to May and can propagate vegetatively at any time. Fruit sets are produced at some sites and seed dispersal is prolific. Possible pollinators are from the Halictidae family.  Threats to the jacquemontia include habitat conversion for residential and commercial construction, having a limited geographic distribution, the fragmentation of the remaining habitat, beech erosion, the small sizes of the populations, and natural events (FWS, 1999).  20   According to the FWS, the beach jacquemontia occurs in the Program counties of Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The coastal habitat of the jacquemontia is not included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the beach jacquemontia.  Crenulate Lead-plant (Amorpha crenulata) Status: The crenulate lead-plant was listed as endangered on July 18, 1985 (USDOI, FWS, 1985a). Pertinent Species Information: The crenulate lead-plant is a perennial shrub that inhabits poorly-drained Opalocka Sands within pine rocklands, wet prairies with Opalocka-rock Outcrop Complex soils, seasonally hydrated soils, including wet pinelands, traverse glades, and hammock edges. These habitats are maintained by frequent burning. It is a rhizomatic plant that flowers in the spring, and it is semi deciduous with approximately 70 percent of the plants losing most or all of their leaves from December to February. This shrub can reach 5 feet in height and can grow in areas of open sun to partial shade. It has been introduced into the Cutler area. Threats to the lead-plant are habitat loss, fire suppression, drainage, and exotic plat invasions from Brazilian pepper, Schinus terebinthifolius, and a large reed (Neyraudia sp.) (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the crenulate lead plant occurs in the Program county of Dade. Program Assessment: The habitats of the lead-plant would not be those included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the crenulate lead-plant.  Small's Milkpea (Galactia smallii) Status: The Small's milkpea was listed as endangered on July 18, 1985 (USDOI, FWS, 1985a). Pertinent Species Information: The Small's milkpea is a perennial legume with small purple flowers that may bloom throughout the year a few weeks after a burn. Normal flowering occurs during the summer months. The habitat of the milkpea is pine rocklands. Several pollinators have been identified, three species of bees (one is a carpenter bee), one species of wasp, and the Cassius blue butterfly. Threats to the species include habitat loss due to conversion to housing, commercial construction, or agriculture; fragmentation of habitat; fire suppression; and invasion by  21   exotics, such as Brazilian pepper and the reed Neyraudia reynaudiana (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Small's milkpea occurs in the Program county of Dade. Program Assessment: The habitat of the milkpea will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Small's milkpea.  Four-petal Pawpaw (Asimina tetramera) Status: The four-petal pawpaw was listed as endangered on September 26, 1986 (USDOI, FWS, 1986b). Pertinent Species Information: The four-petal pawpaw is a shrub that reaches a height of from 3 to over 9 feet. It grows in sand pine scrub habitat on old coastal dunes that are excessively drained. This shrub is deciduous, or partly so, with new leaves emerging in April and continuing to develop into the summer. Flowering occurs throughout the summer but peaks in April and May. Pollinators are most likely beetles with Dipterans, Hymenopterans, and other insects having been observed visiting the flowers. Seed dispersal may be from gopher tortoises and small mammals (Florida mouse) that eat the fleshy fruit. Ingestion of the seeds are not necessary for germination, which occurs from September to March, and can take 1 to 8 months. The pawpaw is adapted to infrequent, intense fires that occur every 20 to 80 years. The abundance of flowers and fruitsets decreases as the canopy closes over the shrub. Threats to the pawpaw come from habitat loss due to its conversion to residential housing and commercial activities (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the four-petal pawpaw occurs in the Program county of Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The coastal dune habitat of the pawpaw will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the four-petal pawpaw. Tiny Polygala (Polygala smallii) Status: The tiny polygala was listed as endangered on July 18, 1985 (USDOI, FWS, 1985a). Pertinent Species Information: The tiny polygala is a short-lived herb that grows to a height of 0.78 to 3.7 inches. It occurs in sand pockets in pine rocklands (sometimes in association with the deltoid spurge), open sand pine scrub, slash pine-high pine, and well-drained coastal spoil. It requires high light and open sand with little or no organic litter accumulation. Seedlings can be observed from late October through April with December through February being the times of greatest visibility. Flowering begins in  22   May and continues throughout the year. The plants show a marked reduction in their condition about 1 year after seedlings appear. The resources of the plant shift from growth and self-maintenance to flowering. The plants die at about 18 months. Pollination of the polygala has not been observed; self-pollination may occur since the tiny polygala has the structures for this. Ants have been observed taking the seeds of this polygala to their hills. Threats to the polygala are habitat loss due to urban development, fire suppression, and exotic plant infestations (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the tiny polygala occurs in the Program counties of Dade and Palm Beach. Program Assessment: The habitat types of the polygala will not be part of the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the tiny polygala.  Snakeroot (Eryngium cuneifolium) Status: The snakeroot was listed as endangered on January 21, 1987 (USDOI, FWS, 1987a). Pertinent Species Information: The snakeroot is an erect perennial herb that occurs in scrub habitat, in nearly barren sand, and usually with rosemary. It grows in sunny sites and readily colonizes bare sand created by fire and other disturbances. Budding occurs in July with flowering from August to October. Fruiting and seed dispersal take place from October to January. The snakeroot reproduces sexually and by seed. Pollination is most likely from generalist insects, which is what pollinates members of this family.  Threats to the snakeroot are habitat loss of the limited number of sites that meet the plant's requirements, fire suppression, and ORV's (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the snakeroot occurs in the Program county of Collier. Program Assessment: The scrub habitat of this plant will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the snakeroot.  Deltoid Spurge (Chamaesyce (=Euphorbia) deltoidea ssp. deltoidea) Status: The deltoid spurge was listed as endangered on July 18, 1985 (USDOI, FWS, 1985a).  23   Pertinent Species Information: The deltoid spurge is a perennial herb that occurs in pine rocklands. It forms mats over exposed limestone and is often found growing in sand pockets in association with the tiny polygala. This spurge requires relatively high light levels and little to no organic litter accumulation. Periodic fires maintain the low litter and open canopy. Flowering occurs from April through November, with July as the peak month. The reproductive ecology of the genus is highly variable. Some members rely on insects for pollination and seed production, and others are self-pollinated. Pollinators may include bees, flies, ants, and wasps. Seed dispersal in the family (Euphorbiaceae) varies from some that are dispersed by explosive seed capsules to some that are dispersed by ants. Threats come from habitat loss, poor management of publicly-owned sites, fire suppression, and invasion by exotic plants (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the deltoid spurge occurs in the Program county of Dade. Program Assessment: The habitat of the spurge will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the deltoid spurge.  Garber's Spurge (Chamaesyce (=Euphorbia) garberi) Status: The Garber's spurge was listed as threatened on July 18, 1985 (USDOI, FWS, 1985a). Pertinent Species Information: The Garber's spurge is a short-lived perennial herb that grows on thin sandy soils or limestone. The habitat types it occurs on are pine rocklands, coastal flats, coastal grasslands, and beach ridges. It can be found in areas that are open and sunny to moderately shaded (FWS, 1999). This spurge flowers and produces fruit from March to December (FWS, 1991). The reproductive ecology of the genus is highly variable. Some members rely on insects for pollination and seed production, and others are self-pollinated. Pollinators may include bees, flies, ants, and wasps. Seed dispersal in the family (Euphorbiaceae) varies from some that are dispersed by explosive seed capsules to some that are dispersed by ants. Threats to the spurge include habitat loss, invasion of the habitat by exotic plants, fragmented habitat, and small populations (FWS, 1999). According to the FWS, the Garber's spurge occurs in the Program county of Dade. Program Assessment: The habitat of the spurge will not be included in the Program area. Therefore, APHIS has determined that the Program will have no effect on the Garber's spurge.  24   25   REFERENCES Bent, Arthur Cleveland, 1962. Life histories of North American shore birds.

ACTION: Notice of 12-month petition finding.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a  12-month finding for a petition to list a distinct population segment  (DPS) of the western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus griseus) in  Washington, in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  amended. After reviewing the best scientific and commercial information  available, we find that the petitioned action is not warranted because  the petitioned entity is not a DPS and, therefore, not a listable  entity. Additionally, we evaluated the Washington populations of the  western gray squirrel relative to the entire range of the subspecies  and determined that the Washington populations collectively do not  constitute a significant portion of the range of the subspecies. We ask  the public to submit to us any new information that becomes available  concerning the status of or threats to this subspecies. This  information will help us monitor and encourage the conservation of this  subspecies.  [[Page 34629]]   DATES: The finding announced in this document was made on May 30, 2003.  Although further listing action will not result from this finding, we  request that you submit new information concerning the status of or  threats to this subspecies whenever it becomes available.  ADDRESSES: You may send data, information, or questions concerning this  finding to the Manager, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western  Washington Fish and Wildlife Office, 510 Desmond Drive SE, Suite 102,  Lacey, WA 98503. In order to inspect the petition, the administrative  finding, supporting information, and comments received, you may make an  appointment during normal business hours at the above address.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ken Berg, Manager, Western Washington  Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES) (telephone 360/753-9440,  facsimile 360/753-9405).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), requires that, for any petition  to revise the List of Threatened and Endangered Species that contains  substantial scientific or commercial information that listing may be  warranted, we make a finding within 12 months of the date of the  receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not  warranted, or (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded by other  pending proposals. Such 12-month findings are to be published promptly  in the Federal Register.     On January 4, 2001, we received a petition dated December 29, 2000,  from the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, Bellingham, Washington, and the  Tacoma Audubon Society, University Place, Washington. The petition  requested an emergency rule to list the Washington population(s) of the  western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus griseus) as threatened or  endangered under the Act or, alternatively, the immediate emergency  listing of just the southern Puget Sound population of western gray  squirrels, followed by a later consideration of the ``full Washington  State distinct population segment under the standard processing  requirements.'' On October 29, 2002, we announced an initial petition  finding in the Federal Register (67 FR 65931) concluding the petition  presented substantial information to indicate there may be one or more  distinct population segments (DPS) of western gray squirrels in  Washington for which listing may be warranted. We are making this 12- month petition finding in accordance with a court order to complete  this finding by June 1, 2003 (Northwest Ecosystem Alliance v. U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service (CV No. 02-945 KI (D.OR)).  Taxonomy      The western gray squirrel belongs to the mammalian order Rodentia,  the suborder Sciurognathi, and the family Sciuridae. There are three  subspecies of western gray squirrel: Sciurus griseus griseus, which  ranges from central Washington to the western Sierra Nevada Range in  central California; S. g. nigripes, which ranges from south of San  Francisco Bay in the central California Coast Range to San Luis Obispo  County; and S. g. anthonyi, which ranges from the southern tip of the  Coast Range (near San Luis Obispo, California) into south-central  California (Hall 1981). Sciurus griseus griseus was described from a  squirrel seen by Lewis and Clark at The Dalles in Wasco County, Oregon  (Bailey 1936; Hall 1981).     The western gray squirrel is the largest native tree squirrel in  the Pacific Northwest and is the only member of the genus Sciurus  native to Washington. Two other members of the genus found in  Washington are introduced species: the eastern gray squirrel (S.  carolinensis) and the fox squirrel (S. niger) (Washington Department of  Wildlife (WDW) 1993). Other common names applied to this subspecies  include the silver-gray squirrel (Bailey 1936; Booth 1947; Maser et al.  1981), California gray squirrel (Grinnell and Storer 1924; Couch 1926),  Oregon gray squirrel (Bowles 1921), Columbian gray squirrel (Bailey  1936), banner-tail (Scheffer 1923), and gray squirrel (Bowles 1920,  Booth 1947).  Description and Natural History      Western gray squirrels are silvery-gray with dark flanks and creamy  white underneath. The tail is long, bushy, and edged with white; darker  hairs in the tail give it a pepper-gray frost effect. Large ears  without tufts also distinguish the western gray squirrel from other  tree squirrels. There is a light reddish-brown wash on the backs of the  ears, but otherwise the western gray squirrel is entirely gray. To some  extent it resembles the eastern gray squirrel, native to the eastern  United States but introduced into the range of the western gray  squirrel. However, eastern gray squirrels, which are smaller in size,  also have smaller tails and rufous (reddish) coloration on the head,  back, flanks, and underparts (WDW 1993; Carraway and Verts 1994; Ryan  and Carey 1995a).     Body measurements of western gray squirrels can be variable. Adult  weights can range from 18 to 33 ounces (520 to 942 grams). Total  lengths (inclusive of body and tail) may range from 20 to 24 inches  (in) (500 to 615 millimeters (mm)), with tail lengths ranging on  average from 9 to 15 in (240 to 381 mm) and body lengths ranging from  10 to 15 in (265 to 391 mm) (Hall 1981; Carraway and Verts 1994). Based  on the results of four studies, body measurements of western gray  squirrels in Klickitat County, Washington, were found to be  significantly larger than elsewhere in the subspecies' range (Mary  Linders, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), pers. comm.  2003d).     Western gray squirrels are arboreal (adapted for living in trees)  and, although they forage on the ground, they rarely stray far from  trees. They use tree canopies for escape, cover, and nesting. Western  gray squirrels can move rapidly and cover long distances among tree  canopies when canopy conditions permit. A contiguous tree canopy that  allows arboreal travel for at least 198 feet (ft) (60 meters (m))  around the nest is an important feature of western gray squirrel  habitat (Ryan and Carey 1995a).     Western gray squirrels avoid open spaces; in the Puget Trough,  western gray squirrels will not cross the prairie to use an isolated  tree (Ryan and Carey 1995a). Western gray squirrels, when released from  traps and pointed toward openings, did not cross the prairie or open  areas any larger than about 40 ft (12 m). Movements across relatively  open areas to small groups of trees or small habitat patches can be  facilitated by scattered saplings and small trees in fence lines or in  the open areas. For example, one radio telemetered squirrel was  observed in a group of three isolated trees separated from the main  stand by scattered individual trees. The distance of movement, which is  rapidly completed, across a relatively open area with scattered trees  may be about 150 ft (50 m) (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003a).     Ryan and Carey (1995b) found that western gray squirrels on Fort  Lewis Military Reservation (Fort Lewis) in Washington were rarely seen  in small (less than 5 ac (2 ha)), isolated pure oak stands or in pure  Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands away from oaks. Western gray  squirrels preferred stands with a mixture of conifers, oaks, and other  food-bearing tree species, and were seen most often in stands greater  than 5 acres (ac) (2 hectares (ha)) in size and not more than 1,280 ft  (390 m) away from water.  [[Page 34630]]      In Washington, and elsewhere within the subspecies' range, the  principal food is acorns, although the seeds of Douglas-fir and other  conifers are also eaten (Dalquest 1948). While pine nuts and acorns are  considered essential foods for storing body fat and conditioning  western gray squirrels for winter, green vegetation, seeds and nuts of  trees and shrubs, fleshy fruits, mushrooms, and other foods are also  consumed. Hypogeous fungi (underground fungi such as truffles) comprise  a large portion of the western gray squirrel diet (WDW 1993; Carraway  and Verts 1994; Ryan and Carey 1995a).     The western gray squirrel is in the northern portion of its range  in Washington, where the diversity of mast-producing tree species is  less than in Oregon or California. ``Mast'' includes fruits and nuts  used as a food source by wildlife. A decreased diversity of food  resources increases the likelihood that concurrent mast failures could  seriously affect the survivability of a mast dependent species such as  the western gray squirrel population (Ryan and Carey 1995a, b; Linders  2000).     Western gray squirrels require a year-round source of water. On  Fort Lewis, western gray squirrels select forested stands within 1,800  ft (550 m) of permanent water (Ryan and Carey 1995b). The majority of  nests at one site in Okanogan County, Washington were within 0.6 mile  (mi) (1 kilometer (km)) of water, with a maximum distance of 1 mi (1.6  km) (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d). Western gray squirrels drink  freely from permanent and intermittent water sources, including lakes,  marshes, rivers, streams, and puddles (Ryan and Carey 1995a).     Western gray squirrels are active throughout the day, but are most  active in the morning. They were observed from dawn to dusk and year  round on Fort Lewis; no nocturnal activity has been observed. Western  gray squirrels are most active in August and September, when they are  collecting and storing food for winter, and they are less visible in  June and July (Ryan and Carey 1995a).     Home range sizes can differ with age, sex, location, population  density, and from year to year. Home range size increases with social  rank and the number of nests used by an individual. Typically, home  range sizes for western gray squirrels vary across the subspecies'  range from 1.2 ac (0.5 ha) recorded for males in a city park in  California, to 16 ac (6.5 ha) in northern Oregon. Recorded home ranges  of females vary from 0.3 ac (0.1 ha) in California to 42 ac (17 ha) in  Oregon in the summer (Ryan and Carey 1995a). However, a study on the  Klickitat Wildlife Area in Klickitat County, Washington, documented  average home range sizes of 180 ac (73 ha) for males and 52 ac (21 ha)  for females (Linders 2000). These home range estimates from Klickitat  County were significantly larger than in other parts of the subspecies'  distribution. However, methods used to determine home range sizes may  be a source of variability (Ryan and Carey 1995a).     Western gray squirrels use two types of stick nests: large, round,  covered shelter nests are used in winter, and broad platforms are for  seasonal or temporary use (Ryan and Carey 1995a). Cavity nests are also  used for rearing young and for sleeping at other times (Carraway and  Verts 1994). Western gray squirrels frequently use more than one nest,  with different individuals often occupying the same nest on successive  nights; two squirrels rarely occupy the same nest simultaneously  (Linders 2000). Construction and use of multiple nests by individual  squirrels, overlap in use, and the fact that nests may remain intact  for 3 to 5 years makes it difficult to associate the number of nests  with an estimate of the population size. As an example, in Klickitat  County, most pregnant and lactating females used cavity nests in oaks  and averaged 14.3 nests each, significantly more than the 3.5 nests per  squirrel reported for southern Oregon.     Males reach sexual maturity at 1 year and females at 10 to11 months  of age. In western Washington, breeding occurs from January to  September, and lactating females have been observed from May to August  (Ryan and Carey 1995a; M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d). Most researchers  believe western gray squirrels have only one litter each year, although  there is some indirect evidence to indicate two litters may be  biologically possible, but uncommon (Ryan and Carey 1995a). Litter  counts ranged from one to five, averaging about 2.6 young/litter over a  3-year period (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d).  Distribution      Historically, the western gray squirrel's distribution was  widespread throughout Washington, Oregon, California, and in western  Nevada along the base of the Carson Range and in Washoe County  (Dalquest 1948). Currently, the subspecies is rare in Nevada and absent  from the Central Valley in California. Western gray squirrels still  occur in the interior valley margin of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon  and Washington; the foothills of the Coast Range in Oregon; the Sierra  Nevada, Tehachapi, Little San Bernardino, Santa Rosa, and Laguna  Mountains in central and southern California; and westward through the  Coast Ranges of California (Carraway and Verts 1994). In California,  the western gray squirrel is fairly common in the Klamath Mountains of  northern California, and the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges of  southern California (California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG)  1990). In Oregon, the western gray squirrel distribution extends along  the southwestern foothills of the Coast Range northward to Coos Bay,  and north along the eastern side of the Coast Range and along both  sides of the Cascade Mountains into Washington (Verts and Carraway  1998).     Western gray squirrels in Washington once ranged from southern  Puget Sound south to the Columbia River, east along the Columbia River  Gorge in the southern Cascades, and north along the eastern slopes of  the Cascades to Lake Chelan. Documentation for western gray squirrels  includes records for Pierce, Thurston, Grays Harbor, Lewis, Clark,  Skamania, Klickitat, Yakima, Kittitas, Chelan, and Okanogan Counties in  Washington. There is one record from extreme northeastern Whatcom  County, probably associated with western gray squirrels in the northern  Cascade Mountains (WDW 1993; WDFW 2002). Currently in Washington, the  western gray squirrel distribution has been reduced to three  geographically isolated western gray squirrel populations in  Washington: the ``Puget Trough'' population, now centered in Thurston  and Pierce Counties in the Puget Sound region; the ``South Cascades''  population in extreme eastern Skamania County and Klickitat and Yakima  Counties; and the ``North Cascades'' population in Chelan and Okanogan  counties (Bayrak[ccedil]i et al. 2001, WDW 1993). The distribution of  western gray squirrels in each of these counties is limited.  Status Review      On October 29, 2002, we published a positive initial 90-day  administrative finding on the petition to list the Washington  population of the western gray squirrel in the Federal Register  indicating the petitioned action may be warranted (67 FR 65931). At  that time, we requested public comments on this initial finding and any  additional information, comments, and suggestions from the public,  governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, and any  other interested parties concerning the status of the subspecies  throughout its range in Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada. We  asked for  [[Page 34631]]  information regarding the subspecies' historic and current  distribution, habitat conditions and use, biology and ecology, threats,  and ongoing conservation measures for the subspecies and its habitat.  We requested any available information on the three Washington  populations of the western gray squirrel concerning (1) the genetics of  these populations as they relate to each other and to the closest  populations in Oregon; (2) the extent to which the two populations east  of the Cascade Mountains are discrete from each other; (3) current  status and trends of each of these populations; (4) the presence of the  subspecies on additional public or private lands; (5) identification of  the current specific threats to each of the populations; and (6) any  additional information supporting the DPS analysis of significance, as  defined in our DPS policy (61 FR 4722), of each of these populations to  the subspecies as a whole.     We received comments, information, and data concerning the status  of the western gray squirrel from 27 individuals, State and local  agencies, nongovernmental organizations, industries, museums, and  universities. Some commenters expressed only support for or opposition  to a potential listing without providing additional documentation.  Information or data from more substantive comments are incorporated,  where appropriate, and concerns raised in the comments are addressed  throughout this petition finding. We also reviewed information from  peer-reviewed journal articles, agency reports and file documents,  telephone interviews, and correspondence with biologists familiar with  the western gray squirrel.  Western Gray Squirrel Status Summary      The rangewide status review initiated in the 90-day petition  finding (67 FR 65931) entailed obtaining and considering the best  scientific and commercial information available to assist us in our DPS  analysis for the western gray squirrel in Washington.  Nevada      Western gray squirrels are considered uncommon in Nevada. They are  only found on the Carson Range in west-central Nevada where they are  yearlong residents; they are not documented to currently occur  elsewhere in Nevada (Biological Resources Research Center, University  of Nevada-Reno (UNR) 2003). Johnson (1954) reported collection of the  subspecies in Washoe County near the California State line, and  observations of individuals along the base of the Carson Range. Hall  (1981) cites marginal records in Verdi and just southwest of Carson  City.     The Nevada western gray squirrel population probably represents a  migrant population from the Sierra Nevada in California on the fringe  of the subspecies' range (UNR 2003). Although western gray squirrels  occur along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, up to 7,700 ft (2,347  m) at times, they probably crossed into Nevada from lower elevations in  the northern Sierra Nevada. The subspecies has never been wide-ranging  in Nevada, and its limited range in Nevada is probably related to the  absence of oak trees (Johnson 1954).     The western gray squirrel is a ``protected species'' under the  Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) (NAC 503.030). There is no open season  on species classified as protected (NAC 503.090), according to criteria  specified in NAC 503.103. The National Heritage Status Rank for the  western gray squirrel in Nevada is S4 (Apparently Secure) (NatureServe  Explorer 2002).     Current distribution and population sizes in Nevada have not been  documented. Although small and possibly isolated from other populations  in the subspecies' range in California, this western gray squirrel  population has apparently never been large. Two public comments in  response to our request for information in the 90-day finding provided  data suggesting that western gray squirrels are ``common in the Lake  Tahoe basin, especially in the urbanized areas of the basin'' (J. Shane  Romsos, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (NV), pers. comm. 2002) and are  ``common and well-adapted to the urban/forest interface setting in  South Lake Tahoe, California'' (Peter Maholland, California Tahoe  Conservancy, pers. comm. 2002). Western gray squirrels are apparently  adapted to habitat and food sources available in these urbanized areas.  California      The western gray squirrel is fairly common in California where it  occupies mature stands of most conifer, hardwood, and mixed hardwood- conifer habitats in the Klamath, Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi, Little San  Bernardino, Santa Rosa, Laguna Mountains, and Transverse and Peninsular  Ranges. Western gray squirrels are also found in riparian stands and  other suitable habitats in the Sacramento Valley (CDFG 1990).     The western gray squirrel is a regulated game species in  California. CDFG bases hunting regulations on estimates of  approximately 12 million ha (30 million ac) of western gray squirrel  habitat, not including orchards, that are occupied by approximately 18  million squirrels just before the breeding season. Their estimates  include an average net increase of about 1.2 million squirrels  annually, after assuming a 50 percent juvenile mortality, a 50 percent  adult mortality, and a hunting harvest rate of less than 1 percent each  year. Their conclusions, based on these estimates, are that hunting  mortality does not have adverse effects on the western gray squirrel  populations, and that environmental and density-dependent mechanisms  help keep the populations in check with their habitats (CDFG 2002).  Also, CDFG data indicate the number of tree squirrel hunters has  declined from a high of about 68,000 in the late 1960s to about 12,000  hunters in 2000. The number of tree squirrels harvested has declined  from a peak of about 350,000 in the late 1970s to about 75,000 tree  squirrels harvested in 2000 (CDFG 2002).     The National Heritage Status Rank for the western gray squirrel in  California is S4 (Apparently Secure) and S5 (Secure) (NatureServe  Explorer 2002). None of the subspecies of the western gray squirrel is  included on the CDFG ``special animal'' list. This list is a general  term referring to all of the taxa the California Natural Diversity Data  Base is interested in tracking, regardless of their legal and  protection status (CDFG 1999).     Several conservation programs, policies, and regulations help  maintain western gray squirrel habitat in California. The Integrated  Hardwood Range Management Program, established in 1986, aims to  maintain, and increase where possible, acreage of California's hardwood  range resources. In 2001, the Oak Woodlands Conservation Act created  the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund for conservation actions to  preserve oak woodlands and guidelines for the program are under  development. The California Forest Practice Rules provide regulations  for maintaining hardwood and riparian components during timber harvest  planning. California Partners in Flight prepared an oak woodland bird  conservation plan to conserve and restore oak woodlands, which will  help maintain western gray squirrel habitats and populations. The 1985  hardwood conservation policy and 1989 hardwood guidelines developed by  the California Fish and Game Commission are used as references to  ensure hardwood conservation measures are considered in all project  proposals reviewed under the California Environmental Quality Act  (Patrick Lauridson, CDFG, in litt. 2002).  [[Page 34632]]  Oregon      There are no historical or current population data for the western  gray squirrel in Oregon, but based on Bailey (1936) and anecdotal  information (Marshall et al. 1996), the numbers and distribution of  western gray squirrels appear to be much reduced. The Natural Heritage  Rank for the western gray squirrel in Oregon is S4? (i.e., the  subspecies is not rare and apparently secure, but with cause for long- term concern; the ``?'' indicates the assigned rank is uncertain)  (Oregon Natural Heritage Program 2001).     Oregon maintains a list of State threatened and endangered species  under the authority of ORS 496.172, the Oregon Endangered Species Act  of 1987 (OESA) (Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 635-100-100 to 635- 100-130), which helps in carrying out the State's policy of preventing  the serious depletion of any indigenous species. Oregon's Sensitive  Species Rule (OAR 635-100-040) requires the Oregon Department of Fish  and Wildlife (ODFW) to develop and maintain a State list of sensitive  vertebrate species that are likely to become threatened or endangered  throughout all or any significant portion of their range in Oregon.  This list was created for the purpose of encouraging actions that will  prevent further declines in species' populations and habitats and avoid  the need for listing under the OESA. The western gray squirrel is  classified by ODFW as a sensitive species of ``undetermined status'' in  Oregon, which indicates the subspecies may be susceptible to population  decline of sufficient magnitude that it could qualify for State  classification as endangered, threatened, critical, or vulnerable  status, but additional research is needed (ODFW 1997; Oregon Natural  Heritage Program 2001). The basis for the western gray squirrel's  sensitive species classification in Oregon includes population declines  caused by timber harvesting and competition with other tree squirrel  species (Marshal et al. 1996). Western gray squirrels are legally  hunted in Oregon. Hunting restrictions that delay and shorten the  hunting season in north-central Oregon, however, help avoid take of  lactating females (Marshal et al. 1996).  Washington      The western gray squirrel was once considered one of the most  commonly encountered mammals in the Pacific Northwest (Bowles 1921).  The western gray squirrel was more widely distributed in prehistoric  times, probably ranging throughout western Washington and the Cascade  Mountains in association with oak communities, but has diminished in  recent times along with the decrease in distribution of oak woodlands  (Rodrick 1987; WDW 1993). One hypothesis suggests that the western gray  squirrel migrated northward into Washington with the spread of Oregon  (Garry) white oak (Quercus garryana) from the Willamette Valley in  Oregon. Dalquest (1948) described the western gray squirrel in  Washington as being a species ``of oak woods rather than coniferous  forest'' with its geographic range largely regulated by the  distribution of oaks, especially Oregon white oak. The range of this  subspecies in Washington, formerly widespread in the oak-conifer  forests, is now less widely distributed and limited to small scattered  populations that follow the range of Oregon white oak (Ryan and Carey  1995a; WDFW 1995).     In Washington, western gray squirrels once ranged from southern  Puget Sound south to the Columbia River, east along the Columbia River  Gorge in the southern Cascade Mountains, and north along the east side  of the Cascade Mountains to Lake Chelan (Booth 1947; Larrison 1970).  During the last century, the western gray squirrel distribution in  Washington has been reduced to three geographically isolated western  gray squirrel populations in Washington: The ``Puget Trough''  population, now centered in Thurston and Pierce Counties in the Puget  Sound region; the ``South Cascades `` population in extreme eastern  Skamania County and Klickitat and Yakima Counties; and the ``North  Cascades'' population in Chelan and Okanogan counties (WDW 1993). The  National Heritage Status Rank for the western gray squirrel in  Washington is S2 (imperiled) (NatureServe Explorer 2002).     There have been relatively few studies of western gray squirrels in  Washington. Early literature was largely observational and anecdotal  (Bowles 1920, 1921; Scheffer 1923; Couch 1926; Dalquest 1948; Larrison  1970). Recent studies to determine western gray squirrel densities,  biology, and ecology have not been consistent in objectives, effort, or  techniques, and have not been directed at determining the status and  trends of the subspecies in all areas of the State.     A regional assessment of the conservation status for potential  western gray squirrel habitat in Washington determined that there are  approximately 1.8 million ac (719,035 ha) of potential western gray  squirrel habitat in the state (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d). In the  Puget Trough, there are 1,797 ac (727 ha) of occupied habitat remaining  (David Brittell, WDFW, in litt. 2003). The estimate of ``occupied''  habitat was based on western gray squirrels and nest locations buffered  by a 183-ac (74-ha) circle, the average home range size for male  squirrels in Klickitat County (D. Britell, in litt. 2003). A 1996 model  was developed to direct survey efforts in Klickitat County, where  62,189 ac (25,167 ha) were identified as occupied. However, application  of the buffering method, developed in a later study, to the 1996  potential habitat model indicated there may be only 56,607 ac (22,908  ha) that are occupied in Klickitat County. In Chelan and Okanogan  Counties, 3,094 ac (1,252 ha) were identified as occupied (Cassidy et  al. 1997; D. Brittell, in litt. 2003).     Puget Trough Population. Bowles (1920, 1921) stated that western  gray squirrels were in the Puget Trough as early as 1896, although ``by  no means common'' at that time, probably because of adverse  environmental conditions and lack of legal protection. He suggested  that western gray squirrels had always been in Pierce County in low  numbers, traveling up from Oregon over time and becoming permanent  residents if food and other natural conditions were satisfactory.  Bowles reported that following legal protection about 1910, there was  an ``immense increase'' in numbers of western gray squirrels. By 1921,  there was significant damage to trees caused by western gray squirrels  stripping bark for food in the Pierce County area. Squirrel hunting was  reinstated in 1926 and continued until 1943, except for a localized  hunt in Thurston and Pierce Counties in 1949 and 1950. The western gray  squirrel became a State protected species in 1954. Although records  show that western gray squirrels still occurred in the Puget Trough in  the 1970s and 1980s, they had become increasingly rare and were found  only in isolated relict populations restricted to a few locations in  the state (Rodrick 1987, WDW 1993, WDFW 2002).     Current population estimates of the western gray squirrel in the  Puget Trough area are limited. In southern Thurston County, the last  western gray squirrel was seen in the late 1970s (WDFW 2002). Surveys  during 1985 and 1986 detected western gray squirrels on just 4 of 26  sites (15 percent), and these were confined to the Fort Lewis area  (Rodrick 1987). In Statewide surveys of 40-ac (16-ha) survey blocks  from 1994 to 2000 by WDFW, western gray squirrels or nest locations  were found in 9 of 100 (9 percent) survey blocks in the Puget Trough.  In February 1996, no  [[Page 34633]]  western gray squirrels were detected in WDFW surveys in Thurston County  (D. Brittell, in litt. 2002). Isolated occurrences have been reported  in the past in Grays Harbor and Lewis Counties (WDFW 2002), and more  recently in Clark County (Tracy Fleming, National Air and Stream  Improvement Council, pers. comm. 2003). In 2002, fewer than a dozen  sightings of western gray squirrels were reported (Dave Clouse, Fort  Lewis, pers. comm. 2003).     Although the western gray squirrel was once common on the partially  wooded prairies adjacent to Puget Sound, the surviving Puget Trough  population is now centered on Fort Lewis in southern Pierce and  northern Thurston Counties where the largest area of oak woodlands  remains. From 1992 to 1993, 156 western gray squirrel observations were  documented on 169 sites on Fort Lewis. These observations were  estimated to represent 81 individual western gray squirrels on 44 oak- conifer sites (Ryan and Carey 1995b). During intensive surveys in 1998  to 1999, only 6 western gray squirrels in only 4 percent (5 of 133)  suitable habitat stands were detected in over 4,000 hours of survey  effort. The researchers concluded that the low western gray squirrel  population on Fort Lewis is at a high risk of extirpation  (Bayrak[ccedil]i et al. 2001). Subsequent western gray squirrel  sightings included 3 (including 1 road kill) in 2000 and 11 (including  1 road kill) in 2002 (D. Clouse, pers. comm. 2003). Factors that may  have influenced the decline of western gray squirrels on Fort Lewis  include (1) poor acorn crops or undependable food resources; (2)  drought and unavailability of water in many oak ecotones; (3) road  kills; (4) competition with eastern gray squirrel and Douglas'  squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii); (5) reduction in quality and  quantity of oak habitat; (6) diseases and parasites; and (7) predation  (Carey and Harrington 2001).     From 1993 to 1995, The Nature Conservancy of Washington conducted  surveys, analyzed nest trees, and trapped western gray squirrels on  McChord Air Force Base (McChord AFB) adjacent to Fort Lewis. Fifteen  observations of western gray squirrels occurred at 6 different  locations on McChord AFB. Most of these observations (13) occurred in  1993, with the remaining two observations occurring in 1995; none were  observed in 1994 (The Nature Conservancy of Washington and Washington  Natural Heritage Program 1996). They hypothesized that western gray  squirrels were dispersing from Fort Lewis to McChord AFB to use acorns  and other food resources when available, but only when environmental  conditions were favorable (e.g., when water sources are available in  wet years). In the mid-1990s, a western gray squirrel occupied a nest  box erected for American kestrels (Falco sparverius) on McChord AFB.  Two or three western gray squirrels were seen in 1995, and possible  western gray squirrel nests were found in 1996 (McChord AFB 2002).  Although western gray squirrels were previously found on private lands,  the last observation of western gray squirrels on private lands  adjacent to the military bases was in 1990 (WDFW 2002).     The western gray squirrel in the Puget Trough of western Washington  persists in a transitional ecological setting, in comparison with the  subspecies' populations elsewhere in its range. Western gray squirrels  in the Puget Trough occupy an ecotone (transitional) habitat composed  of Oregon white oak woodlands situated between upland Douglas-fir  forests and prairies (Ryan and Carey 1995; Bayrak[ccedil]i et al.  2001). Here, scattered woodlands of Oregon white oak and Douglas-fir  encircle the prairies (WDW 1993).     This western gray squirrel population, located at the northwestern  limits of the subspecies' range, occur in habitat that closely conforms  to the distributional range of the Oregon white oak. The western gray  squirrel ranges only as far north in the Puget Trough as the northern  limit of the continuous distribution of Oregon white oak on the  gravelly prairies just south of Tacoma (Dalquest 1948; Larrison 1970;  Stein 1990; WDW 1993). While the Puget Trough area is essentially the  northwestern limit of the continuous range of the Oregon white oak, it  does occurs in discontinuous patches further north on the islands of  Puget Sound and, in British Columbia, Canada, on Vancouver Island and  in two disjunct stands on the mainland (Stein 1990).     Geologic and floristic evidence indicates that Oregon white oak  associations have evolved through successive eras as components of  relatively arid pine forest that repeatedly advanced northward from a  locus in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico as climates  warmed and retreated as climates cooled. The most recent northward  expansion ended about 6,000 years ago (Stein 1990). Pollen spectra  samples show that oak communities were common around Puget Sound during  the warm, dry post-glacial period 10,000 years ago. Subsequent trends  toward cooler and moister conditions have influenced the replacement of  Oregon white oaks by conifers (Stein 1990; Agee 1993; WDW 1993).     Prehistorically, the ``Tacoma prairies'' once occupied the lowland  areas of Pierce and Thurston Counties in the Puget Sound region of the  Puget Trough, with a southward finger into Lewis County; prairies  intermittently reappeared in Clark County down to the Columbia River  (Kruckeberg 1991). This landscape feature of the Puget Trough consists  of a mosaic of prairie, oak woodland, and open forest called a  ``gravelly outwash plain.'' The gravelly outwash prairies coincide with  the southern terminus of the last continental ice sheet during the  Vashon glaciation, which ended 15,000 years ago (Kruckeberg 1991).     Although the Puget Trough of western Washington has a wetter  climate than occurs in much of the Oregon white oak range, the Puget  Sound area is near sea-level and has a warm, relatively dry climate  because of the Puget Sound and the surrounding mountain ranges (Thysell  and Carey 2001). The Puget Sound region is included in the Tsuga  heterophylla (western hemlock) Zone, with many of the same plant  communities. Large areas in this region, however, differ from the  surrounding plant community types in that prairie, oak woodland, and  pine forest are encountered. These plant-community type differences,  related to both climate and soil, include Oregon white oak stands and  prairies being invaded by Douglas-fir and the occurrence of species  rarely or never found in western Washington or northwestern Oregon  (Franklin and Dyrness 1988).     As previously discussed, western gray squirrels depend primarily on  acorns and pine seeds (Sumner and Dixon 1953; Kruckeberg 1991; Carraway  and Verts 1994). Because of the wetter climate and flatter topography  of the Puget Trough in comparison with the rest of the western gray  squirrel range, the habitat is more homogeneous, and there are fewer  mast-producing trees (C. Maser, pers. comm. 2003). Consequently, in  this region, the success of the western gray squirrel is probably more  intimately tied to the success of Oregon white oak because it provides  an essential winter food item for this squirrel.     Elsewhere in the subspecies' range, Oregon white oaks occur in  communities that include a wider range of mast-producing tree species.  In western Washington, the western gray squirrel depends primarily on  Oregon white oak, Douglas-fir, and where available, ponderosa pine  (Pinus ponderosa). In Oregon, the western gray squirrel diet includes  seeds from a  [[Page 34634]]  wider variety of oak (i.e., Oregon white oak, tanoak (Lithocarpus  densifloris), Sadler oak (Quercus sadleriana), canyon live oak (Quercus  chrysolepis), California black oak (Quercus kelloggii), valley oak  (Quercus lobata) and pine species (i.e., sugar pine (Pinus  lambertiana), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), lodgepole pine (Pinus  contorta) than are available to western gray squirrels in the Puget  Trough of Washington (Carraway and Verts 1994; Marshall et al. 1996).     In California, the western gray squirrel is dependent on mature  stands of conifer and oak habitats and is closely associated with oaks  (CDFG 1990). Oak species in western gray squirrel habitat in California  include valley oak (Quercus lobata), blue oak (Quercus douglasii),  California black oak, interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii), and scrub  oak (Quercus dumosa). In addition to Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine,  other tree species in California western gray squirrel habitats include  Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), digger pine (Pinus sabiniana),  white fir (Abies concolor), sugar pine, giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron  giganteum), redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus  globulus) (Carraway and Verts 1994).     Although western gray squirrels consume hypogeous fungi and seeds  and nuts of various trees and shrubs, acorns and pine seed may be more  critical in the diet because they are high-energy foods needed for  overwintering (Ryan and Carey 1995a). In the Puget Trough, acorns are  the principal diet from late summer through early spring. Mushrooms and  truffles are mostly eaten in spring and fall, and Douglas-fir seed are  eaten upon ripening in the late summer through fall. However, mast  crops differ each year caused by the depletion of food reserves in a  heavy seed year, weather in year of fruiting or previous years,  diseases and parasites, and maturation differences among tree groups  (Ryan and Carey 1995a). Oak mast production is sporadic and  unpredictable, with good mast years occurring only once in 7 to 10  years. During an 8-year study in northern Oregon, there were 4 years  with poor Oregon white oak acorn crops. In 1991, there was no acorn  crop in the Columbia River Gorge and an insignificant crop in 1992.  When ponderosa pine is not available, western gray squirrels also rely  on Douglas-fir seed (WDW 1993). However, environmental factors make the  Douglas-fir seed crop erratic, and abundant crops are produced  sporadically, from 2 to 11 years apart. One crop failure and two or  more light to medium crops usually occur between heavy crops (U.S.  Forest Service 1974).     South Cascades Population. Although Booth (1947) noted that western  gray squirrels were uncommon in the southern part of the Cascade  Mountains and more common in Pierce County, the South Cascades  population currently is the largest remaining population of western  gray squirrels in Washington. The western gray squirrel appears to be  widely distributed across Klickitat County, but the populations are  localized. Western gray squirrels remain along the Klickitat River and  Catherine, Major, and Rock Creeks (WDW 1993). Between 1994 and 1996,  systematic field surveys to delineate western gray squirrel  distribution in the Columbia River Gorge documented the presence of  individuals or their sign (e.g., nests) in 22 watershed administrative  units. Surveys were conducted in parts of 275-square mi (712-square km)  sections containing suitable western gray squirrel habitat; their  presence was recorded in 61 percent of these sections (M. Linders,  pers. comm. 2003d).     Based on intensive and widespread surveys in Washington from 1994  to 2000, 89 percent (1,642 of 1,847) of all western gray squirrel nests  and observations occurred in Klickitat County (D. Brittell, in litt.  2002). Eighty-three percent (514 of 618) of the occupied survey blocks  had nest locations alone, and 10 percent (59 of 618) of the survey  units had both western gray squirrels and their nests. The 7 percent  (45 of 618) of the survey units having western gray squirrels with no  known nest locations may have represented dispersal or breeding  movements. Nest-only sites likely had associated western gray  squirrels. Because nests persist for several years, however, a die-off  would be difficult to detect (D. Brittell, in litt. 2002). More recent  information is limited to forest practice surveys and random  encounters. Residents noticed a decline of western gray squirrels in  Klickitat County, particularly following introduction of California  (Beechey's) ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) (Rodrick 1987; WDW  1993).     Statewide surveys from 1994 to 2002 established that most  observations of western gray squirrels and their nests occurred in  Klickitat County (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003c). Surveys in 2000 and  2001 on the Klickitat Wildlife Area documented density estimates of  0.08-0.13 western gray squirrels/ha and a more recent estimate for  western gray squirrels in this area was slightly higher (0.1-0.2  squirrels/ha) (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003b). Density estimates for  western gray squirrels in California ranged from 1.37/ha in the spring  in Lake County to 2.47/ha in the Yosemite Valley (Grinnell and Storer  1924). There are no density estimates for western gray squirrels in  Oregon or Nevada.     Booth (1947) described the western gray squirrel as uncommon in the  southern Cascade Mountains. In Yakima County, western gray squirrels  were abundant in the Ahtanum and Cowiche Creek drainages, and less  common along Oak Creek prior to the 1950s. A mange epidemic in the  1940s and 1950s decimated western gray squirrel populations (Stream  1993). Western gray squirrels may have been extirpated from the Oak  Creek Management Area following a severe mange epidemic in the 1940s  and 1950s; a reintroduction attempt in the area, using western gray  squirrels from Oregon, was not successful (WDW 1993).     Little is known about western gray squirrels on the Yakama Indian  Nation Reservation. Between 1995 and 1998, the Yakama Indian Nation  conducted limited surveys across the reservation. Small nest clusters,  scattered individual western gray squirrels, and negative surveys were  reported (D. Brittell, in litt. 2002).     North Cascades Population. The North Cascades population has  received the least attention of the three Washington populations; no  population or trend data, including density estimates, are available.  There were no systematic attempts to delineate the distribution of  western gray squirrels in the North Cascades prior to 1995. During 1995  surveys by WDFW on the west side of the Methow Valley of Okanogan  County, 21 western gray squirrels (including 3 killed by automobiles)  and 2 nests were observed. In 1996, 22 western gray squirrels,  including roadkills, and 89 nests were observed. No western gray  squirrels were observed during surveys of the east side of the Methow  Valley in 1997. When interviewed, residents of the upper Methow Valley  believed that numbers of western gray squirrels were declining, but  residents of the lower Methow Valley thought the populations had been  stable over the past 15 to 30 years (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d).     In 2000, surveys of all areas previously known to have western gray  squirrel nests detected only 3 remnants out of the 89 nests recorded in  a 1996 survey (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d). Eighteen previously  unreported nests were documented and four western gray squirrels were  observed. Relocating individual nests, however, can be difficult  without detailed mapping and marking (Vander Haegen et al. 2003). Also,  western gray squirrels build and  [[Page 34635]]  use more than one nest per season, and nests may remain intact for 3 to  5 years. Consequently, the fact that only 3 remnant nests and 18  previously unreported nests in an area that formerly had 89 nests may  represent a significant reduction in the number of western gray  squirrel nests in the Methow Valley, possibly suggesting a  corresponding population decline. Additional nest surveys in Chelan  County, not previously surveyed, located seven previously unreported  nests, three western gray squirrels, and one western gray squirrel skin  (no body) (M. Linders, pers. comm. 2003d).     The North cascades population occurs in an ecological setting that  differs from the Puget Trough area. The native range of oaks extended  only into southeastern Yakima County with a patchy distribution in  central Yakima County, central Kittitas County, and northeastern Pierce  County (Stein 1990). The range expansion northward from Yakima County  required adaptations to habitats lacking oaks, the main source of  winter foods for this subspecies in most of its range.     Couch (1928) describes the range of the ``silver gray squirrel'' as  being known from Goldendale (Klickitat County) to Lake Chelan (Chelan  County). Taylor and Shaw (1929) describe the range of the western gray  squirrel as ranging along the eastern edge of the Cascades north to  Lake Chelan. There are verified (reported by reliable biologists or  other knowledgeable individuals) western gray squirrel sightings  recorded for Chelan County from 1938 in the WDFW Natural Heritage  Database (WDFW 2002). Booth (1947) notes records from Lake Chelan.  Larrison (1970) describes the range as including the lower east slopes  of the Cascades to Lake Chelan. He also notes that, while western gray  squirrels are most numerous in the oak woods, they are spotty and  scarce elsewhere in their range.     The western gray squirrel range extension into Okanogan County may  have occurred in response to groves of English walnut (Juglans regia)  and black walnut (J. nigra) planted during the 1940s and 1950s (WDW  1993). Stream (1993) conducted interviews, compiled data from WDW  wildlife data printouts, literature reports, and old files from the WDW  Yakima Regional office and concluded that the western gray squirrel was  native to the east slopes of the Cascade Mountains. He notes that there  was ``apparently a native population in Chelan County, especially  around Lake Chelan,'' but that the documentation was not clear.  Although the predominant habitat used by western gray squirrels was the  oak/pine associations in Yakima County, the oak association was not  found where the western gray squirrels occurred around Lake Chelan. The  interviews revealed that English walnut trees were planted from 1915 to  1920, and by the 1940s, the western gray squirrel was expanding its  range northward due to these planted mast-producing trees. By the  1960s, western gray squirrels were showing up in canyons where black  walnut trees were planted in the 1940s.     Western gray squirrels were present at Lake Chelan at least as  early as the 1920s, and may have been expanding northward before mast- producing trees planted in nut orchards began producing. Their  secretive behavior and low population densities may have made them hard  to see. Although the nut orchards probably stimulated the northward  expansion and helped population sizes increase, western gray squirrels  were also found in natural habitats. Western gray squirrels were  regularly seen on Chelan Butte (southeast side of Lake Chelan) in the  1960s and in Purtteman Gulch (northeast end of Lake Chelan), but were  no longer found there after fires burned the habitat. In the late  1960s, a western gray squirrel nest was found on a pine tree branch in  Ribbon Cliff Canyon (along the Columbia River north of Entiat). Western  gray squirrels were using pine trees and bigleaf maples (Acer  macrophyllum) for food. A few western gray squirrels were found in  Stehekin (northwestern end of Lake Chelan in Chelan County), but could  not survive because of the harsh weather (Mil Sharp, retired WDW  wildlife agent, pers. comm. 1992, as cited in Stream 1993).  Distinct Population Segment Review      Under the Act, we must consider for listing any species,  subspecies, or any distinct population segments of vertebrates if  sufficient information exists to indicate that such action may be  warranted. We, along with the National Marine Fisheries Service  (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Fisheries), developed  a joint policy that addresses the recognition of DPS for potential  listing actions (61 FR 4722). The policy allows for more refined  application of the Act that better reflects the biological needs of a  part of the taxon being considered, and avoids inclusion of entities  that do not require the Act's protective measures.     Under our policy, we use two elements to assess whether a  population segment under consideration for listing may be recognized as  a DPS. These elements are (1) discreteness of the population segment in  relation to the remainder of the species to which it belongs; and (2)  the significance of the population segment to the taxon to which it  belongs. If we determine that a population segment being considered for  listing meets the discreteness and significance standards, then the  level of threat to that population segment is evaluated based on the  five listing factors established by the Act to determine if listing the  population segment as either threatened or endangered is warranted.     Under current conditions, the Washington population of the western  gray squirrel consists of three isolated, disjunct populations. The  three populations resulted from western gray squirrels moving  northward, from the region that is now the State of Oregon and later  became separated from more southern populations by the Columbia River.  The distribution of the western gray squirrel in Washington once  extended from south Puget Sound, east along the Columbia River, and  northward to Lake Chelan and subsequently expanded northward into  Okanogan County in more recent times. We view these three populations  as isolated portions of a once-continuous population, with a common  evolutionary history.  Discreteness      A population segment of a vertebrate species may be considered  discrete if it satisfies either one of the following two conditions:  (1) it is markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon  as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral  factors (quantitative measures of genetic or morphological  discontinuity may provide evidence of this separation); or (2) it is  delimited by international governmental boundaries within which  significant differences in control of exploitation, management of  habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist.     On the basis of available information, we conclude that the  Washington population segment of the western gray squirrel may be  discrete in relation to the remainder of the subspecies' populations  because it appears to be physically separated from other populations to  the south in Oregon, California, and Nevada as a result of geographical  isolation by the Columbia River. Additionally, each of the three  Washington populations appear to potentially be discrete from each  other and this is supported by preliminary genetic analysis (Warheit  (2003)). The Columbia River has likely been a barrier  [[Page 34636]]  to movement and genetic flow for at least 13,000 years (Mercer and Roth  2003), as discussed further below.  Significance      Under our DPS policy, once we have determined that a population  segment is discrete, we consider its biological and ecological  significance to the larger taxon to which it belongs. This  consideration may include, but is not limited to (1) evidence of the  persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting  that is unique for the taxon; (2) evidence that loss of the population  segment would result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon;  (3) evidence that the population segment represents the only surviving  natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an  introduced population outside its historic range; and (4) evidence that  the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations  of the species in its genetic characteristics.     Ecological Setting. The western gray squirrel in the Puget Trough  of western Washington persists in a transitional ecological setting,  where it occupies habitat composed of Oregon white oak in an ecotone  (transitional) between upland Douglas-fir forests and prairies, in  comparison with the subspecies' populations elsewhere in its range  (Ryan and Carey 1995; Bayrak[ccedil]i et al. 2001). Consequently,  existence of the western gray squirrel in the Puget Trough is more  intimately tied to the success of Oregon white oak: Oregon white oak is  the only native oak in Washington (Stein 1990) and provides an  essential winter food item for this squirrel (Sumner and Dixon 1953;  Kruckeberg 1991; Carraway and Verts 1994). Acorns and pine seed are  critical high-energy foods needed for overwintering (Ryan and Carey  1995a). In western Washington, western gray squirrels have adapted to a  more homogeneous environment with fewer and less reliable food  resources (Oregon white oak, Douglas-fir, and some ponderosa pine),  particularly relying on the acorn of a single tree species as its  essential storable winter food resource, thus occupying a less  suitable, marginal habitat. Elsewhere in the subspecies' range, Oregon  white oaks occur in communities having a wider range of mast-producing  tree species, including a variety of oak and pine species, which allows  western gray squirrels to use different food resources when one food  resource has a poor year for mast production.     The North Cascades population found east of the Cascade Mountains  also persists in an ecological setting which differs from the Puget  Trough and the South Cascades. In this population, western gray  squirrels expanded their distribution into areas beyond the native  range of Oregon white oak. The presence of western gray squirrels in  Chelan County early in the twentieth century (Couch 1928; Booth 1947;  Larrison 1970; Stream 1993; WDFW 2002) indicates adaptations to using  other food resources. The continuous distribution of Oregon white oak  extended into Yakima County, with only a spotty distribution into  Kittitas County (Stein 1990). The range expansion northward from Yakima  County required occupying habitats lacking oaks that provided the main  winter food for the subspecies, relying on ponderosa pine as the  primary food.     The Washington populations of western gray squirrels are found in  differing ecological settings within the State. However, it is not  clear that they should collectively or independently be considered as  unique ecological settings for the taxon. For example, while the  grasslands and oak woodlands of the Puget Sound area have different  vegetation complexes compared to the grasslands and oak woodlands where  western gray squirrels are found in northern California or southern  Oregon, these differences are not so great that we consider the habitat  of the Puget Sound population to be a unique or unusual ecological  setting for western gray squirrel. The South Cascades population shares  many habitat features common to the habitat for western gray squirrels  found in Oregon. The North Cascades population's habitat is notable in  its absence of oaks, the main source of winter foods for this  subspecies in most of its range. This population appears to rely on the  seed of pine trees and bigleaf maples (Acer macrophyllum). Throughout  their range, however, western gray squirrels consume a variety of types  of tree seeds, including many conifer species. In summary, we do not  find that the Washington populations individually or collectively are  located in an ecological setting unusual or unique for the taxon, such  that they meet the significance criterion of the DPS policy.     Gap in the Range. The Washington population segment of the western  gray squirrel is at the northern portion of the historic and current  distribution of the subspecies. Within the Washington population  segment, the Puget Trough population represents the northwestern  extension, and the North Cascades population represents the  northeastern extension of the subspecies' range.     Within the distribution of every species there exists a peripheral  population, an isolate or subpopulation of a species at the edge of the  taxon's range. The population is the basic evolutionary and ecological  functional unit. The local population is where responses to  environmental challenges occur, where adaptations arise, and where  genetic diversity is maintained and reshuffled each generation. A  species can continue to exist even though many of its populations are  destroyed, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and what may be unique  genetic or phenotypic traits (Meffe et al.1997). Peripheral populations  are often located at a species' ecological limits where unique genetic  combinations are exposed to and tested by environmental circumstances  that may not be found elsewhere in the range of the species. When a  peripheral population is isolated from gene flow from other  populations, the isolated peripheral population may become highly  adapted to local conditions. Distinctive traits found in peripheral  populations can be important for the survival and evolution of a  species as a whole (Meffe et al. 1997).     Long-term geographic isolation and the loss of gene flow between  populations is the foundation for genetic changes in populations  resulting from natural selection or chance. Evidence of changes in  peripheral populations may include genetic, behavioral and/or  morphological differences from populations in the rest of the  subspecies' range. Ecological differences were described above, and  genetic differences in western gray squirrels are discussed below. We  also considered information regarding morphological and behavioral  differences in regard to adaptations that may be occurring in the  western gray squirrel in Washington.     The secretive behavior of the western gray squirrel in Washington  has been frequently noted and might represent an adaptation of a  population on the periphery of its range. Bowles (1921) wrote,  regarding western gray squirrels in Pierce County, Washington, that  ``although extremely numerous, we may walk for days in the country they  inhabit and never see one.'' Scheffer (1923) indicated that in the more  heavily timbered country in Washington, the gray squirrel was only  occasionally seen. Couch (1926) noted that, although western gray  squirrels are hard to see, the presence of western gray squirrels in  the lower Puget Sound region is evident in the peeled bark of Douglas- fir. Larrison (1970) wrote that western gray squirrels in Washington  are ``rather shy and do not mix well with civilization,'' and in the  few places  [[Page 34637]]  where they have entered settled areas it ``keeps hidden from the  watcher.'' During surveys on McChord AFB, observers noted that western  gray squirrels often fled from the presence of the observer (The Nature  Conservancy of Washington and Washington Department of Natural  Resources (WDNR) 1996). More recently, researchers conducting surveys  on Fort Lewis described western gray squirrels as ``very wary and  challenging to approach and therefore can be difficult for observers to  detect'' (Bayrak[ccedil]i et al. 2001).     In Oregon, although described as ``shy and retiring'' in the  countryside where they have little human contact, western gray  squirrels can be found in urban parks where they are more tolerant of  human contact (Susan Weston, in litt. 2003). Along the Nevada/ California border, western gray squirrels appear to be well-adapted to  the urban-forest interface (P. Maholland, pers. comm. 2003) and have  been reported as common in the Lake Tahoe basin, especially in the  urbanized areas (J.S. Romsos, pers. comm. 2003).     Whether the western gray squirrels in Washington are more secretive  than those elsewhere in the range of the subspecies is unclear.  Although evidence of shy behavior of the western gray squirrel has long  been documented for the Washington population, similar behavior has  been documented in Oregon (Susan Weston, in litt. 2003). We believe  this behavior may be consistent with a species at the edge of its  range, where the amount of habitat is restricted by fragmentation and  may be less than optimum, and that rather than being ``shy,'' they are  difficult to observe and maintain a close affinity with the habitat  that remains. The observation of western gray squirrels in towns in  Oregon and Nevada may also be an artifact of there being larger  populations of squirrels in this portion of the subspecies' range. The  differences between rural and urban communities may also be less  distinct in Oregon and Nevada, with the rural characteristic of large  Oregon white oak or ponderosa pine trees or possibly other planted nut  trees providing suitable habitat for the squirrels in the urban  environment.     Overall, much of the available information on ``secretiveness'' of  the subspecies is anecdotal in nature and there are no comparative  studies to determine whether real behavioral differences in  secretiveness exist across the range of the subspecies. Even if such  differences do exist, the reasons for them are not clear, including  whether or how such behavior might be related to the periphery of the  range. The significance of such differences, if they exist, also is  unclear.     In evaluating potential differences in the subspecies at the  northern extent of its range, we also considered information on  morphology and home range size. Body measurements of western gray  squirrels in Klickitat County, Washington, were found to be  significantly larger than elsewhere in the subspecies' range (M.  Linders, pers. comm. 2003d). This study was conducted in a small area  of Klickitat County and results were compared to another study in  Washington with a small sample size, and with two California studies.  Based on the limited area studies and the small sample size, the  results may not be conclusive and applicable for western gray squirrels  over their entire range. We also considered information showing that  western gray squirrels on the Klickitat Wildlife Area have  substantially larger home range sizes when compared with home range  estimates elsewhere in the subspecies' distribution. In this same  study, western gray squirrels also used significantly more nests per  squirrel than recorded for the subspecies in Oregon (Linders 2000).  These results, while interesting, do not explain the reasons for the  differences in home range size and numbers of nests. The limited sample  size is a confounding factor in interpreting these results. Also, as  noted above, differences in methods used to determine home range sizes  may be a source of variability in results among studies (Ryan and Carey  1995a). Many factors could account for these differences, and we have  no basis for concluding that these results should be attributed to the  location of the study area at the northern periphery of the range of  the subspecies. Consequently, we do not believe that the information  concerning morphology, home range size, or number of nests described  for western gray squirrels in Klickitat County provides a justification  for a determination of significance under the DPS policy.     The importance of peripheral populations in relation to climate  change is a continuing source of discussion and study in the scientific  community. Species' ranges can change dramatically with global shifts  in climate. Peripheral populations may survive in isolated refugia that  later, with different environmental conditions, serve as a source  population for an expanded range and subsequent radiation. What  constitutes a peripheral population today could be the center of a  species' range in the future, and consequently peripheral populations  are vitally important to a species' past, present, and future existence  (Nielsen et al. 2001).     We have considered the extent to which western gray squirrels in  Washington may be significant in relation to climate change. As the  result of a climate shift, as occurred in the past when Oregon white  oaks moved northward from Oregon, the northern limits of the western  gray squirrel range could expand northward as the changing climate  again favors Oregon white oak distribution over conifer distributions.  At this time there is speculation, but no clear evidence, of the  potential role that western gray squirrels in Washington might play in  relation to the rest of the subspecies in response to climate change.  Similarly, the nature and extent of the effects of climate change on  ecological conditions for the western gray squirrel in Washington are  not known. Based on the speculative nature of the situation involving  the western gray squirrel in relation to climate change, we do not have  a basis for concluding that a potential gap in the distribution of  western gray squirrels at the northern extent of its range would have  evolutionary implications for the subspecies in relation to the  potential effects of climate change.     Lastly we consider whether the potential reduction in the range of  the subspecies that could occur in the event of the hypothetical loss  of the Washington populations, collectively or individually, would meet  the significance criterion of the DPS policy. Individually, we do not  find that the loss of range that would be represented by the loss of  any of the current Washington populations meets the significance  criterion of the DPS policy. The limited population information  available makes a determination about potential significance  particularly difficult, but when viewed individually we do not see the  potential reduction in range of each population as reaching  significance to the subspecies. Collectively, the loss of all of the  Washington populations would represent a serious reduction in the  species range. However serious such a hypothetical reduction might be,  we do not have information currently that demonstrates this  consideration would meet the DPS policy's requirement of significance  to the taxon (subspecies) as a whole, since there is only limited  information on the potential biological and ecological significance for  Washington in terms of range of the subspecies.     Whether the Population Represents the Only Surviving Natural  Occurrence of the Taxon. As part of a determination  [[Page 34638]]  of significance, our DPS policy suggests that we consider whether there  is evidence that the population represents the only surviving natural  occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an  introduced population outside its historic range. The western gray  squirrel in Washington is not the only surviving natural occurrence of  the subspecies. Consequently, this factor is not applicable to our  determination regarding significance.     Marked Differences in Genetic Characteristics. The DPS policy  suggests that one measure of significance is evidence that the discrete  population segment differs markedly from other populations of the  subspecies in its genetic characteristics. Preliminary evidence of  genetic variation among the three western gray squirrel populations in  Washington and two populations in Oregon showed that genetic  variability may exist (Parametrix, Inc. 1999). The sample sizes,  however, were too small for substantive conclusions (M. Linders, pers.  comm. 2003d).     In 2003, researchers from WDFW and the University of Washington  completed genetic analyses, using standard conservation genetic  research techniques, the results point towards significant genotypic  differentiation between Washington populations and squirrel populations  south of the Columbia River. The report presents the results of two  different types of genetic analyses (microsatellite DNA analysis and  mitochondrial control region sequence analyses). The following  discussion of the results of the genetic analyses is summarized from  Warheit (2003).  Microsatellite DNA Analysis      Microsatellite DNA analyses were completed on samples from 128  western gray squirrels from California (3), Oregon (24), and Washington  (101). Samples were obtained from museum skins, museum tissue  collections, road-killed individuals, and ear punches from live-trapped  individuals.     Microsatellites are short (no longer than six base pairs  (nitrogenous bases that are part of the DNA molecule, such as cytosine  and guanine)) tandemly repeated segments interspersed throughout the  chromosome. Changes in the repeats result in different lengths of DNA,  and a specific length of DNA can be used as a marker for a  microsatellite locus (position on the chromosome). Seven of these loci  that showed variation were analyzed. The results of the microsatellite  analysis was summarized by the genetic diversity (the variation in  chromosomes) and the genetic differentiation (how different genetically  are the populations).  Genetic Diversity      [sbull] An allele is a series of two or more different genes that  occupy the same position on a chromosome. All populations in Oregon and  California showed at least three private alleles (alleles present in  only that population), while no Washington population had a private  allele. This indicates that while all alleles present in each of the  Washington populations are also present in at least one of the Oregon  or California populations, there are alleles present in either Oregon  or California that are not present in Washington.     [sbull] The Washington populations show reduced genetic diversity  at all measures compared with populations south of the Columbia River,  despite the fact that the mean sample size per locus is larger for each  of the Washington populations.     [sbull] The reduction in genetic diversity within the Washington  populations may be a function of genetic drift, which in turn may be  the result of relatively smaller effective population sizes in  Washington compared with that in Oregon and California.  Genetic Differentiation      [sbull] There is significant differentiation between each of the  Washington populations, and the Oregon and California populations.     [sbull] These data support the hypothesis that each of the  Washington Western Gray Squirrel populations are genetically distinct  from each other, and are now functioning as separate and isolated  populations.     [sbull] What these analyses demonstrate is that there is  considerably more genetic differentiation between Washington and Oregon  or California, than there is between Oregon and California populations.  Mitochondrial Control Region Sequence Analyses      A subset (67) of the same samples from 128 western gray squirrels  used in the Microsatellite DNA analyses were used for an additional  mitochondrial control region sequence analyses. Mitochondria are  structures in the cell, but outside of the nucleus, which contain DNA  inherited only from the mother. A 367 basepair portion of the DNA from  the control region of mitochondria was sequenced (Warheit 2003).     [sbull] The haplotype is the set, made up of one allele of each  gene. Haplotypes comprise the genotype (or genetic constitution of an  individual or taxon). They identified only three haplotypes from 40  Washington individuals, compared with 14 haplotypes from 27 Oregon and  California individuals, and no haplotype was shared across the Columbia  River.     [sbull] Genetic differences between populations can also be  measured using nucleotide diversity (i.e., average sequence  difference). The nucleotide diversity between populations equated to  long time intervals since these the Washington and California or Oregon  populations diverged (roughly 12,000 to 126,000 years ago).     [sbull] Some haplotypes in Washington are more closely related to  haplotypes in Oregon than other haplotypes in Washington.     Warheit (2003) summarized the results of these analyses by noting:  this study still requires additional analyses for at least three  reasons. First, samples sizes need to be increased for each of the  populations south of the Columbia River. Although I do not  anticipate that an increase in sample size for each of the Oregon  and California will significantly alter the conclusions drawn from  the current data set, a greater likelihood and confidence in these  conclusions will arise from more samples from Oregon and California.  Second, the overall levels of genetic diversity for each of the  seven microsatellite markers used in this study are low, and a  greater number of microsatellite loci will provide us with a broader  survey of the squirrel genome. [T]hird, we need to obtain the  control region sequences for the new samples included in the  expanded analysis of microsatellites. A more complete set of  analyses is needed on the control region data to help understand the  historical events that may have produced the phylogeographic  patterns drawn from the data (e.g., nested clade analysis).     Despite the preliminary nature of these analyses, the following  set of conclusions have been strengthened by the inclusion of a  larger sample size from the Fort Lewis and Okanogan Western Gray  Squirrel populations:     1. Washington populations of Western gray Squirrels show reduced  genetic diversity at both nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial  (control region sequences) markers compared with populations from  Oregon and California. This reduction in genetic diversity may be  the result of genetic drift and relatively smaller effective  populations sizes.     2. There is significant genetic differentiation between  Washington Western Gray Squirrels, and squirrels from populations  south of the Columbia River. Both the microsatellite and sequence  data support the hypothesis that the Washington squirrels are a  population(s) distinct from those in Oregon and California.     3. There is significant genetic differentiation among the three  Washington populations. * * *     Additional and more variable microsatellites should be included  in any  [[Page 34639]]  subsequent study. It may be advantageous to develop microsatellites  specifically for Western Gray Squirrels, rather than adapt  microsatellites developed in other species of sciurids.      Thus, the preliminary information from Warheit (2003) suggests that  there is genetic differentiation between Washington western gray  squirrels, and squirrels from populations south of the Columbia River.  We believe that this information supports our contention that western  gray squirrel populations in Washington collectively or individually  could meet the discreteness criterion of the DPS policy. However, we  find that based on the genetic information currently available, the  western gray squirrel populations in Washington collectively or  individually do not differ markedly from other populations of the  subspecies in their genetic characteristics such that they should be  considered biologically or ecologically significant based simply on  genetic characteristics. Biological and ecological significance under  the DPS policy is always considered in light of Congressional guidance  (see Senate Report 151, 96th Congress, 1st Session) that the authority  to list DPS's be used ``* * * sparingly'' while encouraging the  conservation of genetic diversity.     One of the more notable pieces of genetic information in the  Washington populations is the lack of genetic diversity. As noted  above, this reduction in genetic diversity may be the result of genetic  drift and relatively smaller effective populations sizes. While there  is clearly some genetic information that shows that the Washington  populations are different from other populations (e.g., in the  microsatellite DNA analyses no haplotype was shared across the Columbia  River, also evidence suggests a long time interval since the Washington  and California or Oregon populations diverged), at this time we do not  be believe them to be markedly so. The information we believe  counterbalances the differential information is the fact that all  alleles present in each of the Washington populations are also present  in at least one of the Oregon or California populations, that some  haplotypes in Washington are more closely related to haplotypes in  Oregon than other haplotypes in Washington, and the fact that the  Washington populations of western gray squirrels show reduced genetic  diversity at both nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial (control  region sequences) markers.     Information on genetics supports the contention that western gray  squirrels in Washington have been isolated from other populations for a  long period of time. The results suggest that genetic differences may  occur between populations of the western gray squirrel throughout its  range. The genetics studies by Warheit (2003) rely on relatively  limited sample sizes for some populations, n = 3 for California.  Results from the genetics studies may be confounded by the effects of  small population size and the consequent inbreeding and genetic drift.  The patterns of differentiation that were observed may reflect the  negative consequences of isolation, range contraction, and recent  significant declines of local populations. To what extent the forces of  isolation, genetic drift and/or inbreeding have impacted the western  gray squirrel population remaining in Washington is uncertain.  Conclusion      On the basis of available information, we determined that the  Washington populations of the western gray squirrel may be discrete in  relation to the remainder of the subspecies' populations. This  determination is based on information showing that the populations  appear to be geographically separated from, and to have some genetic  differences from, other populations to the south in Oregon, California,  and Nevada as a result of isolation by the Columbia River. But,  pursuant to our DPS policy, this apparent directness does not  necessarily mean that the populations in Washington are significant to  the remainder of the taxon.     Consequently, following a review of the available information, we  conclude that the western gray squirrel populations in Washington are  not significant to the remainder of the taxon. We made this  determination based on the best available information, which does not  demonstrate that (1) these populations persist in ecological settings  that are unique for the taxon; (2) the loss of these populations would  result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon; and (3) these  populations differ markedly from other populations of the subspecies in  their genetic characteristics, or in other considerations that might  demonstrate significance. Further, the available information does not  demonstrate that the life history and behavioral characteristics of  these populations in Washington are unique to the subspecies. We  acknowledge that, while the precise biological and ecological  importance of a discrete population segment is likely to vary from case  to case, we were unable to identify any other information that might  bear on the biological and ecological importance of these populations.  Significant Portion of the Range      Pursuant to the Act and our implementing regulations, a species may  warrant listing if it is threatened or endangered in a significant  portion of its range. Consequently, we evaluated the three populations  in Washington to determine if they collectively constitute a  significant portion of the range of the subspecies. In our evaluation  we considered whether the geographic extent of the range of the western  gray squirrel in Washington is significant relative to the remainder of  the subspecies' range. Based on the extent of the range of the western  gray squirrel subspecies, from southern California north to Washington  as discussed in the Background section of this notice, we do not  believe that Washington constitutes a significant portion of the  geographic extent of the subspecies, and subsequently the range of the  subspecies. Further, the available information regarding the collective  abundance of animals in the three populations in Washington does not  indicate that the Washington population constitutes a significant  portion of the western gray squirrel population rangewide.  Consequently, we have determined that the population of the western  gray squirrel in Washington does not constitute a significant portion  of the subspecies or its range.  Finding      We have carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial  information available regarding the discreteness and significance of  the western gray squirrel in Washington. We reviewed the petition,  literature cited in the petition, information available in our files,  peer-reviewed literature and other published and unpublished literature  and information, and information submitted to us during the comment  period following our 90-day petition finding. We have consulted with  biologists and researchers, including geneticists familiar with the  western gray squirrel, and reviewed the status of the western gray  squirrel in light of the requirements of our DPS policy. On the basis  of the best scientific and commercial information available, we  conclude that the populations of western gray squirrel in Washington do  not represent a DPS, and are therefore not a listable entity. Our  review did indicate that these populations may be discrete from other  western gray squirrel populations south of the Columbia River, but  under our DPS policy, the Washington populations collectively or  individually are not  [[Page 34640]]  significant to the remainder of the taxon. This finding is primarily  based on the fact that available information does not demonstrate that  the Washington populations have marked genetic, ecological, or  behavioral differences when compared with the remainder of the  subspecies. As such, we find that the petitioned action is not  warranted. Further, we have concluded that the three populations in  Washington are not significant to the remainder of the taxon, and  consequently do not constitute a significant portion of the range of  the subspecies.

GX088-28-12067331	[Federal Register: July 22, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 140)] [Rules and Regulations]                [Page 47726-47740] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr22jy02-14]                           ======================================================================= -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  Fish and Wildlife Service  50 CFR Part 17   RIN 1018-AI61     Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Listing the Sonoma  County Distinct Population Segment of the California Tiger Salamander  as Endangered  AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.  ACTION: Emergency rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), exercise our  authority to emergency list the Sonoma County Distinct Population  Segment of the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense),  as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended  (Act). Currently, only seven known breeding sites of the Sonoma County  population remain. In the past two years, four breeding sites have been  destroyed or have suffered severe degradation. Plans to construct a  residential development will result in the loss of one of the seven  remaining breeding sites and severely impact and further isolate  another two of the remaining breeding sites. Because these losses  constitute an emergency posing a significant and imminent risk to the  well-being of the Sonoma County Distinct Population Segment of the  California tiger salamander, we find that emergency listing is  necessary.     This emergency rule provides Federal protection pursuant to the Act  for a period of 240 days. A proposed rule to list the Sonoma County  Distinct Population Segment of the California tiger salamander as  endangered is published concurrently with this emergency rule in this  same issue of the Federal Register in the Proposed Rule Section.  DATES: This emergency rule becomes immediately effective July 22, 2002,  and expires March 19, 2003.  ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection,  by appointment, during normal business hours at the Sacramento Fish and  Wildlife Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2800 Cottage Way,  Suite W-2605, Sacramento, CA 95825.

Wooten, Susan Moore, Amy  LaVoie, or Chris Nagano, Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, at the  address  [[Page 47727]]  listed above (telephone 916/414-6600; facsimile 916/414-6713).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The California tiger salamander was first described as a full  species, Ambystoma californiense, by Gray in 1853, based on specimens  that had been collected in Monterey, California (Grinnell and Camp  1917). Storer (1925) and Bishop (1943) also considered the California  tiger salamander to be a species. Dunn (1940), Gehlbach (1967), and  Frost (1985) stated the California tiger salamander was a subspecies of  the more widespread tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum). However,  based on recent studies of the genetics, geographic distribution, and  ecological differences among the members of the A. tigrinum complex,  the California tiger salamander is now considered to be a distinct  species (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Shaffer et al. 1993; Jones 1993;  Shaffer and McKnight 1996; Irschick and Shaffer 1997; Petranka 1998).     The California tiger salamander is a large, stocky, terrestrial  salamander with small eyes and a broad, rounded snout. Adults may reach  a total length of 208 millimeters (mm) (8.2 inches (in)), with males  generally averaging about 203 mm (8 in) in total length, and females  averaging about 173 mm (6.8 in) in total length. For both sexes, the  average snout-vent length is approximately 91 mm (3.6 in). The small  eyes have black irises and protrude from the head. Coloration consists  of white or pale yellow spots or bars on a black background on the back  and sides. The belly varies from almost uniform white or pale yellow to  a variegated pattern of white or pale yellow and black. Males can be  distinguished from females, especially during the breeding season, by  their swollen cloacae (a common chamber into which the intestinal,  urinary, and reproductive canals discharge), more developed tail fins,  and larger overall size (Stebbins 1962; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996).     California tiger salamanders are restricted to California and their  range does not naturally overlap with any other species of tiger  salamander (Stebbins 1985; Petranka 1998). Based on genetic analysis,  there are seven populations of California tiger salamanders, which are  found on the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma County, the Sacramento Valley  area (Yolo, Solano, Colusa, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Sacramento  Counties), Stanislaus County, the east Central Valley (Madera, Fresno,  and north Tulare Counties), the Diablo Range (western Merced and San  Benito Counties), the Inner Coast Range (Monterey and San Luis Obispo  Counties), and Santa Barbara County (Shaffer et al. 1993). The  California tiger salamander on the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma County  inhabits low elevation (below 60 meters (m) (200 feet (ft)) vernal  pools and seasonal ponds, associated grassland, and oak savannah plant  communities. The historic range of the species also may have included  the Petaluma River watershed, as there is one historic record of a  specimen from the vicinity of Petaluma from the mid-1800s (Borland  1856, as cited in Storer 1925).     California tiger salamanders on the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma  County are geographically separated from other California tiger  salamander populations. The closest California tiger salamander  populations to Sonoma County are located in Contra Costa, Yolo, and  Solano Counties, which are separated from the Sonoma County population  by the Coast Range, Napa River, and the Carquinez Straits, a distance  of about 72 kilometers (km) (45 miles (mi)).     The known breeding sites of the California tiger salamander in  Sonoma County are restricted to Huichica-Wright-Zamora and Clear Lake- Reyes soils series/associations as defined by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA 1972, 1990). The poorly drained soils in the  Huichica-Wright-Zamora association (yellow outlined in red on Soil Map)  are considered prime soils for containing wetlands, and more  specifically, prime soils for habitat containing California tiger  salamander (P. Northen Sonoma State University pers. comm.). The  Huichica-Wright-Zamora association is restricted to the Santa Rosa  Plain and the vicinity of the town of Sonoma (USDA 1972, 1990). The  poorly drained soils in the Clear Lake-Reyes association are considered  suitable to marginal soils for containing wetlands or habitat for  California tiger salamander (Northen pers. comm.). The Clear Lake-Reyes  association is found from the Cotati region south and east of Petaluma  to the tidelands of northern San Francisco Bay where the salt marsh  habitat is unsuitable for the California tiger salamander. There are  also scattered areas of the Clear Lake-Reyes association found south  and southwest of the town of Sonoma (USDA 1972, 1990). There are no  known records of the California tiger salamander from the area around  the town of Sonoma (D. McGriff California Department of Fish and Game  pers. comm.) and there is now extensive urban and agricultural  development in this portion of the County. The remainder of areas in  Sonoma County outside of the two soil series/associations discussed  above contain soils that are well drained, rocky, or otherwise  unsuitable for habitat for the California tiger salamander.     Subadult and adult California tiger salamanders spend the dry  summer and fall months of the year estivating (a state of dormancy or  inactivity in response to hot, dry weather) in the burrows of small  mammals, such as California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi)  and Botta's pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) (Loredo and Van Vuren 1996;  Petranka 1998; Trenham 1998a). During estivation, California tiger  salamanders eat very little (Shaffer et al. 1993). Once fall or winter  rains begin, they emerge from these retreats on nights of high relative  humidity and during rains to feed and migrate to the breeding ponds  (Stebbins 1985, 1989; Shaffer et al. 1993). The salamanders breeding  in, and living around, a seasonal pool or pools, and associated uplands  where estivation can occur, constitute a breeding site. A breeding site  is defined as a location where the animals are able to successfully  breed in years of ``normal'' rainfall and complete their estivation.  Normal rainfall in Santa Rosa is 76 centimeters (cm) (30 in) per year  (National Weather Service 2002).     Adult California tiger salamanders may migrate up to 2 km (1.2 mi)  from their estivation sites to the breeding ponds (Sam Sweet,  University of California, Santa Barbara, in litt., 1998). The distance  between these areas depends on local topography and vegetation, and the  distribution of ground squirrel or other rodent burrows (Stebbins 1989;  Lawrence Hunt, consultant, in litt.,1998). Males migrate before females  (Twitty 1941; Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996; Trenham  1998b). Males usually remain in the ponds for an average of about 6 to  8 weeks, while females stay for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. In dry  years, both sexes may stay for shorter periods (Loredo and Van Vuren  1996; Trenham 1998b). Although most marked salamanders have been  recaptured at the pond where they were initially captured, in one study  approximately 20 percent were recaptured at different ponds (Trenham  1998b). The rate of natural movement of salamanders among breeding  sites depends on the distance between the ponds or complexes of ponds  and on the intervening habitat (e.g., salamanders may move more quickly  through sparsely covered and more open grassland versus more densely  vegetated lands) (Trenham 1998a). As with migration distances, the  number of ponds used by an individual over its  [[Page 47728]]  lifetime will be dependent on landscape features and environmental  factors.     The adults mate in the ponds and the females lay their eggs in the  water (Twitty 1941; Shaffer et al. 1993). Females attach their eggs  singly, or in rare circumstances, in groups of two to four, to twigs,  grass stems, vegetation, or debris (Storer 1925; Twitty 1941). In ponds  with limited or no vegetation, they may be attached to objects, such as  rocks and boards, on the bottom (Jennings and Hayes 1994). After  breeding, adults leave the pond and return to the small mammal burrows  (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a), although they may continue to come  out nightly for approximately the next 2 weeks to feed (Shaffer et al.  1993). In drought years, the seasonal ponds may not form and the adults  cannot breed (Barry and Shaffer 1994).     Eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days, with newly hatched larvae ranging from  11.5 to 14.2 mm (0.45 to 0.56 in) in total length. The young  salamanders (larvae) are aquatic. They are yellowish gray in color and  have broad heads, large, feathery gills, and broad dorsal fins that  extend well onto their back. The larvae feed on zooplankton, small  crustaceans, and aquatic insects for about 6 weeks after hatching,  after which they switch to larger prey (Anderson 1968). Larger larvae  have been known to consume smaller tadpoles of Pacific treefrogs  (Pseudacris regilla) and California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) (J.  Anderson 1968; P. Anderson 1968). The larvae are among the top aquatic  predators in the seasonal pond ecosystems. The larvae often rest on the  pond bottom in shallow water, but also may be found at different layers  in the water column in deeper water. The young salamanders are wary and  when approached by potential predators will dart into the vegetation on  the bottom of the ponds (Storer 1925).     The larval stage of the California tiger salamander usually lasts 3  to 6 months, as most ponds dry up during the summer (Petranka 1998).  Amphibian larvae must grow to a critical minimum body size before they  can metamorphose (change into a different physical form) to the  terrestrial stage (Wilbur and Collins 1973). Individuals collected near  Stockton in the Central Valley during April varied from 47 to 58 mm  (1.85 to 2.28 in) in length (Storer 1925). Feaver (1971) found that  California tiger salamander larvae metamorphosed into terrestrial  juveniles and left the breeding ponds 60 to 94 days after the eggs had  been laid, with larvae developing faster in smaller, more rapidly  drying ponds. The longer the ponding duration, the larger the larvae  are able to grow, and the more likely they are to survive as  metamorphosed juveniles and reproduce as adults (Semlitsch et al. 1988;  Morey 1998). The larvae will perish if a site dries before they  complete metamorphosis (P.R. Anderson 1968; Feaver 1971). Pechmann et  al. (1988) found a strong positive correlation between ponding duration  and total number of metamorphosed juveniles in five salamander species.     When the metamorphosed juveniles leave their ponds, in the late  spring or early summer, before the ponds dry completely, they settle in  small mammal burrows at the end of their nightly movements (Zeiner et  al. 1988; Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo et al. 1996). Like the adults,  juveniles may emerge from these retreats to feed during nights of high  relative humidity (Storer 1925; Shaffer et al. 1993) before settling in  their selected estivation sites for the dry hot summer months.  Juveniles have been observed to migrate up to 1.6 km (1 mi) from  breeding ponds to estivation areas (Austin and Shaffer 1992).     Lifetime reproductive success for California and other tiger  salamanders is low. Trenham et al. (2000) found the average female bred  1.3 times and produced 8.5 young that survived to metamorphosis per  reproductive effort; this resulted in roughly 11 metamorphic offspring  over the lifetime of a female. Preliminary data suggest that most  individuals of the California tiger salamanders require 2 years to  become sexually mature, but some individuals may be slower to mature  (Shaffer et al. 1993). Some animals do not breed until they are 4 to 6  years old. While individuals may survive for more than 10 years, many  may breed only once, and, in some populations, less than 5 percent of  marked juveniles survive to become breeding adults (Trenham 1998b).  With such low recruitment, isolated populations can decline greatly  from unusual, randomly occurring natural events as well as from human- caused factors that reduce breeding success and individual survival.  Factors that repeatedly lower breeding success in isolated ponds that  are too far from other ponds for migrating individuals to replenish the  population can function to quickly extirpate a population.     The life history and ecology of the California tiger salamander on  the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma County make it likely that this  population has a metapopulation structure (Hanski and Gilpin 1991). A  metapopulation is a set of local populations or breeding sites within  an area, where typically migration from one local population or  breeding site to other areas containing suitable habitat is possible,  but not routine. Movement between areas containing suitable habitat  (i.e., dispersal) is restricted due to inhospitable conditions around  and between areas of suitable habitat. Because many of the areas of  suitable habitat may be small, and support small numbers of  salamanders, local extinction of these small units may be common. A  metapopulation's persistence depends on the combined dynamics of these  local extinctions and the subsequent recolonization of these areas by  dispersal (Hanski and Gilpin 1991, 1997; McCullough 1996; Hanski 1999).     We believe habitat loss has reduced the sizes and connectivity  between patches of suitable and occupied salamander habitat on the  Santa Rosa Plain. The reduction in the extent and amount of suitable  water bodies, grasslands, and other suitable upland habitats likely has  eliminated connectivity among most of the known breeding sites, making  recolonization of some sites more difficult following local extinction.  In addition, the reduction of habitat below a certain size threshold  has the effect of reducing the quality of the remaining habitat by  reducing the size of habitat boundaries, and making effects of other  factors such as amount of food, availability of rodent burrows,  pesticide use, mortality from vehicles, and predators more pronounced  given the smaller area now exposed to such impacts. There is not enough  data to determine what the size threshold for habitat might be, whereby  any further reduction would lower the quality of the remaining habitat.  But it is probable that the acreage is dependent on factors such as the  type of building occurring along habitat boundaries (i.e., residential,  industrial, community park), number of roads bordering the habitat and  the amount of traffic those roads experience, amount of pesticide use  within the breeding pool watershed, or whether domestic animals or  people have access to the site during periods when salamanders are  vulnerable such as migrating to or from estivation sites. It is likely  that there is a size beyond which the combination of various impacts  will result in the loss of more salamanders than the Sonoma County  California tiger salamander population can produce, and thus local  extinction will occur.  Previous Federal Action      On September 18, 1985, we published the Vertebrate Notice of Review  (NOR) (50 FR 37958), which included the California tiger salamander as  a category 2 candidate species for possible future  [[Page 47729]]  listing as threatened or endangered. Category 2 candidates were those  taxa for which information contained in our files indicated that  listing may be appropriate but for which additional data were needed to  support a listing proposal. The January 6, 1989, and November 21, 1991,  candidate notices of review (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively)  also included the California tiger salamander as a category 2  candidate, soliciting information on the status of the species.     On February 21, 1992, we received a petition from Dr. H. Bradley  Shaffer of the University of California at Davis (UCD), to list the  California tiger salamander as an endangered species. We published a  90-day petition finding on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), concluding  that the petition presented substantial information indicating that  listing may be warranted. On April 18, 1994, we published a 12-month  petition finding (59 FR 18353) that the listing of the California tiger  salamander was warranted but precluded by higher priority listing  actions. We elevated the species to category 1 status at that time,  which was reflected in the November 15, 1994, NOR (59 FR 58982).  Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which we had on file  sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to  support preparation of listing proposals.     We discontinued the use of different categories of candidates in  the NOR, published February 28, 1996 (61 FR 7596), and defined  ``candidate species'' as those meeting the definition of former  category 1. We maintained the California tiger salamander as a  candidate species in that NOR, as well as subsequent NORs published  September 19, 1997 (62 FR 49398), October 25, 1999 (64 FR 57533), and  October 30, 2001 (66 FR 54808).     On June 12, 2001, we received a petition dated June 11, 2001, from  the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and Citizens for a  Sustainable Cotati to emergency list the Sonoma County population of  the California tiger salamander as an endangered species and to  designate critical habitat. On February 27, 2002, CBD  filed  a complaint  for our failure to emergency list the Sonoma County population of the  California tiger salamander as endangered (Center for Biological  Diversity v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Case No. C- 02 -0558 WHA)).  On June 6, 2002, based on a settlement agreement between ourselves and  CBD, the court signed an order requiring us to submit for publication  in the Federal Register, a proposal and/or emergency rule to list the  species by July 15, 2002. This emergency listing rule, and the  concurrently published proposed rule, complies with the settlement  agreement.  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment      Under the Act, we must consider for listing any species,  subspecies, or, for vertebrates, any Distinct Population Segment (DPS)  of these taxa if there is sufficient information to indicate that such  action may be warranted. To implement the measures prescribed by the  Act and its Congressional guidance, we, along with the National Marine  Fisheries Service, developed policy that addresses the recognition of  DPSs for potential listing actions (61 FR 4722). The policy allows for  a more refined application of the Act that better reflects the  biological needs of the taxon being considered, and avoids the  inclusion of entities that do not require its protective measures.  Under our DPS policy, we use two elements to assess whether a  population segment under consideration for listing may be recognized as  a DPS. The elements are: (1) The population segment's discreteness from  the remainder of the species to which it belongs; and (2) the  significance of the population segment's to the species to which it  belongs. If we determine that a population segment being considered for  listing represents a DPS, then the level of threat to the population is  evaluated based on the five listing factors established by the Act to  determine if listing it as either threatened or endangered is  warranted.  Discreteness      A population segment of a vertebrate species may be considered  discrete if it satisfies either one of the following two conditions:  (1) It is markedly separated from other populations of the same taxon  as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral  factors. Quantitative measures of genetic or morphological  discontinuity may provide evidence of this separation; or (2) it is  delimited by international governmental boundaries within which  significant differences in control of exploitation, management of  habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist. The  proposed DPS is based on the first condition, the marked separation  from other populations.     The Sonoma County population of the California tiger salamander  (Sonoma County population) is discrete in relation to the remainder of  the species as a whole. The population is geographically isolated and  separate from other California tiger salamanders. The Sonoma County  population is widely separated geographically from the closest  populations which are located in Contra Costa, Yolo, and Solano  Counties. These populations are separated from the Sonoma County  population by the Coast Range, Napa River, and the Carquinez Straits, a  distance of about 72 km (45 mi). There are no known records of the  California tiger salamander in the intervening areas (Dee Warenycia,  California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), pers. comm., 2002).  There is no evidence of natural interchange of individuals in the  Sonoma County population with other California tiger salamander  populations. As detailed below, this finding is supported by an  evaluation of the genetic variability of the species.     Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer analyzed the population genetics of the  California tiger salamander (Shaffer et al. 1993). Allozyme variation  (distinct types of enzymes (proteins) in the cells, which are formed  from an individuals inherited genes) and mitochondrial DNA sequence  data indicate that there are seven distinct populations of the  California tiger salamander. These seven populations differ markedly  from each other in their genetic characteristics, with the Sonoma  County population having gene sequences not found in any other  populations (Shaffer et al. 1993). The sequence divergence between the  Sonoma County population was found to diverge on the order of 2 percent  from other populations of this species. This high level of genetic  divergence indicates that there has been little, if any, gene flow  between the Sonoma County population and other California tiger  salamanders populations. Shaffer's mitochondrial DNA sequence data  (Shaffer and McKnight 1996) suggest that the seven distinct populations  differ markedly in their genetic characteristics, with Sonoma County  California tiger salamanders having gene sequences not found in other  California tiger salamanders. These levels of divergence justify  separate species recognition between the Sonoma County population and  the other California tiger salamander populations and may warrant  separate taxonomic recognition (Shaffer et al. 1993; Shaffer and  McKnight 1996).  Significance      Under our DPS policy, once we have determined that a population  segment is discrete, we consider its biological and ecological  significance to the larger taxon to which it belongs. This  consideration may include, but is not limited to, evidence of the  persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting  that is unique for the taxon; evidence that loss of the population  segment would result in a  [[Page 47730]]  significant gap in the range of the taxon; evidence that the population  segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon  that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside  its historic range; and evidence that the discrete population segment  differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic  characteristics. We have found substantial evidence that two of these  significance factors are met by the population of the California tiger  salamander that occurs on the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma County.     The extinction of the Sonoma County population would result in the  loss of a significant genetic entity and the curtailment of the range  of the species. As discussed above, the Sonoma County population is  genetically distinct from other populations of California tiger  salamanders. Loss of the Sonoma County population would eliminate the  most northern coastal extent of the range of the species. The Sonoma  County population is geographically isolated. Genetic analysis of the  species supports the hypothesis that no natural interchange of the  Sonoma County population occurs with other California tiger salamander  populations.  Conclusion      We evaluated the Sonoma County population as a DPS, addressing the  two elements which our policy requires us to consider in deciding  whether a vertebrate population may be recognized as a DPS and  considered for listing under the Act. We conclude that the Sonoma  County population is discrete, as per our policy, based on its  geographic separation and genetic divergence from the rest of the  California tiger salamander populations. We conclude that the Sonoma  County population of the California tiger salamander is significant  because the loss of the species from the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma  County would result in a significant reduction in the species' range  and would constitute loss of a genetically divergent portion of the  species. Because the population segment meets both the discreteness and  significance criteria of our DPS policy, the DPS qualifies for  consideration for listing. An evaluation of the level of threat to the  DPS based on the five listing factors established by the Act follows.  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part  424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act  describe the procedures for adding species to the Federal list. We may  determine a species to be endangered or threatened due to one or more  of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and  their application to the Sonoma County DPS of the California tiger  salamander (Sonoma County California tiger salamander) are as follows:  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of its Habitat or Range      The Sonoma County California tiger salamander population, as well  as the population in Santa Barbara County, which we listed as  endangered (65 FR 57242), are considered to be the most vulnerable of  the seven populations of the California tiger salamander (Shaffer et  al. 1993; LSA Associates 2001). Urban development is the primary threat  to the Sonoma County California tiger salamander. The species now  occurs in scattered and increasingly isolated breeding sites within a  small portion of its historic range on the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma  County. Four known breeding sites have been destroyed in the last two  years. All of the seven known extant breeding sites are distributed in  the City of Santa Rosa, and the immediate associated unincorporated  areas, an area approximately 8 km (5 mi) by 6 km (4 mi) wide. Within  this area and south to the Cotati area, there are scattered records of  adult salamanders crossing roads during the fall and winter rains, and  also instances of breeding in roadside ditches. However, these roadside  ditches likely do not represent viable breeding sites because they  either do not have sufficient ponding duration and/or associated  uplands for estivation.     The seven known breeding sites are imperiled by the construction of  high-density housing, office buildings, road construction, and other  development. The survival and viability of the Sonoma County California  tiger salamander is directly related to availability of breeding pools  with hydrological and other factors conducive to their reproduction.  There also must be adequate upland acreage, with associated small  mammal burrows, in the vicinity of the Sonoma County California tiger  salamander breeding pools to accommodate estivation. The Santa Rosa  Plain once contained extensive valley oak woods, native grasslands,  riparian, and vernal pools. Vernal pools and seasonal wetlands likely  were extensive, due to the flat terrain, clay soils, and relative high  rainfall (CH2M Hill 1995). Based on the topography and habitat type of  the lands that have been converted to urban development and agriculture  on the Santa Rosa Plain, the number of breeding ponds, the extent of  upland habitats, and the quality of the remaining habitats has been  greatly reduced since Europeans first settled the region.     The extent of the historic range of the California tiger salamander  within the Santa Rosa Plain in Sonoma County is uncertain due to  limited information collected on this population prior to the 1990s  (Shaffer et al. 1993; Jennings and Hayes 1994). However, based on the  habitat requirements of the species for low elevation, seasonally  filled breeding ponds and small rodent burrows, the ecology of the  taxon, the general trend of urban development into suitable and  occupied habitat, and other adverse factors affecting the species, we  believe that it once occupied a more extensive, but still limited area  within the Santa Rosa Plain.     There are no available estimates of the total number of individual  Sonoma County California tiger salamanders. The difficulty of  estimating total California tiger salamander population size has been  discussed by a number of biologists (Shaffer et al. 1993; Jennings and  Hayes 1994). However, estimates have been made for only a few  populations in Monterey County (Barry and Shaffer 1994; Trenham et al.  1996). This is due to the lack of data about the numbers of individuals  of the Sonoma County California tiger salamander, the fact that these  amphibians spend much of their lives underground, and the fact that  only a portion of the total number of animals migrate to the ponds to  breed every year.     A 1990 study of the Santa Rosa Plain found that 25 percent of an  11,300 hectare (ha) (28,000 acres (ac)) study area had been converted  to subdivisions, ``ranchettes,'' golf courses, and commercial buildings  (Waaland et al. 1990). An additional 17 percent of the study area had  been converted to agricultural uses. Since 1990, many more acres have  been urbanized and converted to intensive agriculture, particularly  vineyards. Even relatively minor habitat modifications, such as  construction of roads, storm drains, and road curbs that traverse the  area between breeding and estivation sites, increase habitat  fragmentation, impede or prevent migration, and result in direct and  indirect mortality (Mader 1984; S. Sweet, in litt., 1993, 1998; Findlay  and Houlahan 1996; Launer and Fee 1996; Gibbs 1998). All of the known  Sonoma County California tiger salamander breeding pools are within 450  m (1,476 ft) of roads and residential  [[Page 47731]]  development, and five of the seven remaining viable breeding locations  are within 100 m (328 ft) of major development activities. Urban Development     Urban development poses a significant threat to all of the known  breeding sites of the Sonoma County California tiger salamander. All of  these sites are found in and around the former Santa Rosa Air Center  that is located in west Santa Rosa. This area contains one of the  largest undeveloped blocks of land within the city limits of Santa  Rosa. Urban development is proposed on or near locations containing  three of the seven known breeding sites in the Santa Rosa area (Santa  Rosa Department of Community Development 1994; EIP Associates 2000).  The airport was closed and the property sold to the City of Santa Rosa  in the mid-1980s. The City of Santa Rosa is proposing the majority of  the area be developed as part of their Southwest Area Plan (Santa Rosa  Department of Community Development 1994; EIP Associates 2000). Urban  development of this area is proceeding rapidly. Demographic data  obtained from the City of Santa Rosa Housing and Community Development  Commission indicate that since 1980, Santa Rosa has experienced a  greater than 53 percent increase in its population. From 1980 until  1997, the number of housing units grew by 66 percent from 35,403 units  in 1980 to 53,558 units by January 1, 1997 (Michael Enright, City of  Santa Rosa, pers. comm., 2001).     Four known breeding sites were lost within the past two years, two  of which were lost due to urban development/housing with another lost  to commercial development. As recently as June 2002, the fourth  breeding site near Cotati was destroyed when the pond was filled for  unknown reasons (David Cook, The Wildlife Society, in litt., 2002; Liam  Davis, CDFG, in litt., 2002). The Cotati location was considered highly  productive for salamanders (D. Cook, in litt., 2002). Roads and Highways     California tiger salamanders require a large amount of barrier-free  landscape for successful migration (Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo et al.  1996). Roads and highways are permanent physical obstacles that can  block the animals from moving to new breeding habitat, or prevent them  from returning to their breeding ponds or estivation sites. Road  construction can reduce or completely eliminate a breeding site, and in  some cases, larger portions of a metapopulation.     All the pools at the known extant Sonoma County California tiger  salamander breeding sites are within 460 m (1,509 ft) of roads of  various sizes. Findlay and Houlahan (1996) found that roads within  2000m (1.2 mi) of wetlands adversely affected the number of amphibian  species. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/Broadmore North  Preserve, and Hall Road Preserve are the only lands with known breeding  sites where salamanders can access breeding pools from estivation areas  without crossing roads.     Large numbers of California tiger salamanders at some locations in  the Central Valley, up to 15 or 20 per mile of road (Joe Medeiros,  Sierra College, pers. comm., 1993), have been killed as they crossed  roads on breeding migrations (Hansen and Tremper 1993; S. Sweet, in  litt., 1993). Estimates of losses to automobile traffic range from 25  to 72 percent of the breeding population for several different  populations of the species (Twitty 1941; S. Sweet, in litt., 1993;  Launer and Fee 1996). Curbs and berms as low as 9 to 13 cm (3.5 to 5  in), which allow salamanders to climb onto the road but can restrict or  prevent their movements off the roads, can effectively turn the roads  into sources of high mortality (Launer and Fee 1996; S. Sweet, in  litt., 1998). Automobile traffic along Stony Point Road in western  Santa Rosa has probably quadrupled in the past 5 years (D. Cook, pers.  comm., 2002). This was once a moderately used rural road and is now a  major route for commuter traffic. Between November 21, 2001, and  December 5, 2001, 26 California tiger salamanders were found killed by  cars on this road between Santa Rosa and Cotati. Fourteen of these dead  California tiger salamanders were found along Stoney Point Road near  Meachum Road (D. Cook, pers. comm., 2002). Description of the Breeding Sites     Except for the Hall Road Preserve and the FEMA/Broadmore North  Preserve, all of the known breeding sites of the Sonoma County  California tiger salamander are found on small locations in areas being  rapidly converted from low-intensity farming, cattle grazing, and low- density housing, to high density housing, and office buildings. The  Hall Road Preserve and the FEMA/Broadmore North Preserve have  hydrologic regimes that are adequate to provide recruitment for SCTS in  normal to dry years. All other known breeding locations are either  slated for development or will have their hydrology altered by  disrupting the natural runoff from surrounding uplands. A description  of the known extant breeding sites of the Sonoma County California  tiger salamander is presented below.     (1) Hall Road Preserve: This 74 ha (183 ac) site is owned by CDFG.  It is the largest preserved area where the Sonoma County California  tiger salamander is currently known to occur. It contains two pools  with ponding levels adequate for successful breeding during drought  years. This preserve contains seven additional breeding pools that are  relatively shallow and do not pond water long enough for successful  breeding in years of moderate to low rainfall. Surveys conducted over  the past 2 years indicate this preserve does not function as a highly  productive breeding site (Cook and Northern 2001). The land surrounding  the preserve is privately owned, and the City of Santa Rosa has issued  permits for urban development. Urban development has occurred on  adjacent lands to the east and west, and agriculture to the north of  the preserve. Exotic predators of the salamander, such as Louisiana  crayfish (Procrambus clarkii), sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus, a  fish), and possibly bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) are present at the  Hall Road Preserve.     (2) FEMA/Broadmore North Preserve: This breeding site consists of  two properties, the FEMA Preserve and the Broadmore North Preserve. The  24 ha (59 ac) FEMA Preserve is owned by CDFG and it contains one of the  most productive Sonoma County California tiger salamander breeding  sites. The 6.5 ha (16 ac) Broadmore North Preserve is a conservation  area that was set aside as mitigation by the Bellvue School District.  It is also managed by CDFG. The two breeding sites are contiguous and  encompass 30 ha (75 ac) containing three breeding pools. The FEMA  Preserve has two large, deep pools that remain ponded late in the  season. Salamanders probably breed there during most years. The one  breeding pool on Broadmore North is shallow and does not contribute  salamanders to the population in dry years (i.e., there is no  recruitment) (D. Cook, pers. comm., 2001). While there is no  hydrological connection between this site and the deeper pools  contained on the FEMA Preserve, the FEMA Preserve probably allows the  salamanders at the Broadmore North Preserve the opportunity to breed  during dry years. Urban development has occurred to the north and east  sides of the preserves. Although these breeding sites are protected,  urbanization imperils upland habitats on private land to the east and  west of them. A new road and housing development on lands adjacent to  the  [[Page 47732]]  preserves' western boundaries have been permitted by City of Santa  Rosa. This new road and construction will eliminate the western  migration route between Southwest Air Center and the FEMA and Broadmore  North preserves for salamander from this breeding site.     (3) Northwest Air Center: This breeding site is composed of one  breeding pond and is located on private land. Much of the associated  upland has recently been developed. This site is bordered on the west  and north by roads subject to heavy traffic from housing developments  that have been constructed under the City of Santa Rosa's Southwest  Area Development Plan. Housing has eliminated migration routes to the  east and south, thus leaving this site as an isolated breeding site  with less than 22 ha (55 ac) of remaining undeveloped upland area and  pool with private lands surrounding it to the south and east (M.  Enright, pers. comm., 2001).     (4) Southwest Air Center: This breeding site is located on private  land and it contains one breeding pool. The City of Santa Rosa has  issued permits for a residential development that likely will result in  the elimination of the salamanders at this location. Preparation of  this site for construction has been initiated. The grading of the  upland areas in the summer dry season likely will eliminate estivating  salamanders at this site. The salamanders at this location also may  utilize the breeding ponds at the FEMA and Broadmore North preserves by  an existing migration corridor to the east. The destruction of this  breeding site likely will further isolate the animals inhabiting this  location. Loss of this breeding site will contribute to the overall  isolation of the remaining breeding sites. Based on the completion time  of the construction of other approved projects in the area, the West  Air Center breeding site likely will be lost by September 2002.     (5) North Air Center: There is one breeding pool on this privately  owned site. Recent residential and commercial developments which border  this breeding site on three sides severely restrict the potential for  migration. The City of Santa Rosa has approved residential and road  projects for this location that will adversely affect the salamanders.  This site is bordered by houses to the west, a road with high levels of  automobile traffic to the north, and a corporate park to the east.  There is a small tract of undeveloped private land to the south. No  protection exists for the uplands or breeding pool which is located  directly south of Sebastopol Road. The upland area is about 15 ha (37  ac). Portions of Sebastopol Road have been widened to four traffic  lanes, including the construction of storm drains and curbs. The curbs  likely funnel migrating salamanders into storm drains where they perish  after being washed into the sewer system. Residential and commercial  projects currently are under construction in this area, and this  breeding site likely will be significantly degraded and completely  isolated by September, 2002.     (6) Wright Avenue: This breeding site is located on private land.  Approved development described in the City of Santa Rosa's Southwest  Area Development Plan will isolate this breeding site through increased  automobile traffic and residential development along Wright and Ludwig  avenues. Additionally, there is no construction specifically proposed  for this property, but no protection exists to prevent the breeding  site and associated uplands from being developed.     (7) South Ludwig Avenue: This breeding site is located on private  land and current threats to the salamanders include increased traffic  along Ludwig Avenue due to increasing residential development. The  breeding site and associated uplands are currently not protected from  potential development on the property. Conclusion for Factor A     Maintenance of tracts of habitat between breeding sites will likely  play a pivotal role in maintenance of the Sonoma County California  tiger salamander metapopulation dynamics. If breeding sites are  eliminated and the metapopulation becomes so fragmented that  individuals are unable to disperse between suitable patches of habitat,  the probability of natural recolonization will not offset the  probability of extinction, with a result of population extinction. Some  of the salamander breeding sites, such as the FEMA Preserve/Broadmore  North Preserve and the pools at the Hall Road Preserve, are linked to  each other by suitable habitat. If movements through these linkages are  disrupted or precluded (e.g., by urban development), then the stability  of the metapopulation (i.e., the exchange of individuals between  breeding sites) will be affected. Isolation, whether by geographic  distance or ecological factors, will prevent the influx of new genetic  material, and may result in inbreeding and extinction (Levin 2002). We  believe that the Sonoma County California tiger salamander is at risk  from increasing fragmentation and isolation that is the result of urban  development.  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      The larvae of non-native tiger salamanders are used as bait by some  fishermen and are still sold in California for this purpose. The extent  of the use of the Sonoma County California tiger salamander for this  purpose is unknown.     Tiger salamanders are considered to be excellent pets by amateur  herpetologists (Porras 2002). The Sonoma County California tiger  salamander does not appear to be particularly popular among amphibian  and reptile collectors; however, Federal listing could raise the value  of the species within wildlife trade markets and increase the threat of  unauthorized collection above current levels (Special Agent Ken  McCloud, Service, pers. comm., 2002). Even limited interest in the  species could pose a serious threat to the small population of this  species.  C. Disease or Predation  Disease     The specific effects of disease on the Sonoma County California  tiger salamanders is not known and the risks to the animal have not  been determined. Large numbers of dead and dying California tiger  salamanders were observed in a pond in the Los Alamos Valley in Santa  Barbara County, but the cause was not determined (S. Sweet, pers.  comm., 1998). Several pathogenic (disease-causing) agents, including at  least one bacterium (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), a water mold  (fungus) (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997; Lefcort et al. 1997), and a  virus (McLean 1998), have been associated with die-offs of tiger  salamanders, as well as other amphibian species. Since Sonoma County  California tiger salamanders are found in only a few sites in a  relatively small area, a disease outbreak could devastate one or all of  the known extant breeding sites if introduced into Sonoma County.     Worthylake and Hovingh (1989) described repeated die-offs of tiger  salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) at Desolation Lake in the Wasatch  Mountains of Utah. Affected salamanders had red, swollen hind legs and  vents, and widespread hemorrhage of the skin and internal organs. The  researchers determined that the die-offs were due to infection from the  bacterium Acinetobacter. The number of bacteria in the lake increased  with increasing nitrogen levels as the lake dried. The nitrogen was  believed to come from both atmospheric deposition and waste from sheep  grazing in the  [[Page 47733]]  watershed (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989). Acinetobacter are common in  soil and animal feces.     Lefcort et al. (1997) found that tiger salamanders raised in  natural and artificial ponds contaminated with silt were susceptible to  infection by the water mold Saprolegnia parasitica at a location in  Georgia. The fungus first appeared on the feet, spread to the entire  leg, and then infected animals died. Die-offs of western toads (Bufo  boreas), Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae), and Pacific treefrogs also  have been associated with Saprolegnia infections (Kiesecker and  Blaustein 1997). Saprolegnia is widespread in natural waters and  commonly grows on dead organic material (Wise 1995).     In addition to the Acinetobacter, viruses associated with die-offs  of tiger and spotted salamanders in Maine and North Dakota, have been  isolated (McLean 1998). In 1995, researchers reported similar die-offs  attributed to an iridovirus in southern Arizona and near Regina,  Saskatchewan, Canada (McLean 1998). Iridoviruses are found in both fish  and frogs and may have been introduced to some sites through fish  stocking programs. Little is known about the historical distribution of  iridoviruses in salamander populations. The virus may be carried by  birds, such as herons and egrets (Family Ardeidae), that feed on the  salamanders. Such a virus could be devastating to the Sonoma County  California tiger salamanders. Predation     Predation and competition by introduced or non-native species  potentially affects all of the seven known Sonoma County California  tiger salamander breeding sites. Bullfrogs prey on California tiger  salamander larvae (P.R. Anderson 1968; Lawler et al. 1999). Morey and  Guinn (1992) documented a shift in amphibian community composition at a  vernal pool complex, with California tiger salamanders becoming  proportionally less abundant as bullfrogs increased in number. Although  bullfrogs are unable to establish permanent breeding populations in  unaltered vernal pools and seasonal ponds, dispersing immature frogs  take up residence in pools during winter and spring (Morey and Guinn  1992), and may prey on native amphibians, including larval salamanders.  One of the pools at the Hall Road breeding site, and two of the pools  contained at the FEMA/Broadmore North preserves, are located within 46  m (150 ft) of ditches or creek channels known to contain bullfrogs or  crayfish. Bullfrogs likely occur in Roseland Creek , which is near the  FEMA/Broadmore North preserve (D. Cook, pers. comm., 2002). Bullfrogs  are likely present in ditches that cross the Hall Road Preserve (D.  Cook, pers. comm., 2002).     Mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), rather than pesticides, are often  placed into ponds by vector control agencies to eliminate mosquitoes.  Salamanders may be especially vulnerable to mosquito fish predation due  to their fluttering external gills, which may attract these visual  predators (Graf 1993). Loredo-Prendeville et al. (1994) found no  California tiger salamanders inhabiting ponds containing mosquito fish.  Mosquito fish prey on other amphibian species, such as the California  newt (Taricha torosa) (Gamradt and Kats 1996) and Pacific treefrog  (Goodsell and Kats 1999) tadpoles in both field and laboratory  experiments, even given the optional prey of mosquito larvae (Goodsell  and Kats 1999; Lee Kats, Pepperdine University, pers. comm., 1999).  Robert Stebbins observed mosquito fish ingesting and then spitting out  California newt larvae, causing severe damage to the newts in the  process (Graf 1993). Given the effects of mosquito fish on other  amphibian species, they are likely to have similar effects on  California tiger salamanders. If they have the same effects, the use of  mosquito fish in California tiger salamander habitat threatens the  persistence of the species, especially in the isolated and decline  Sonoma County California tiger salamander population.     Other fish, such as sticklebacks, may prey on the Sonoma County  California tiger salamander. One pool at the Hall Road Preserve appears  to have all of the biological components for successful California  tiger salamander breeding, but has a small connector to a drainage  ditch containing stickleback. Sonoma County California tiger  salamanders have never been found at this site, and it is suspected  that predation of their eggs and larvae by this fish is the limiting  factor (D. Cook, pers. comm., 2002).     Crayfish also apparently prey on California tiger salamanders  (Shaffer et al. 1993) and may have eliminated some populations  (Jennings and Hayes 1994). The crayfish prey on California newt eggs  and larvae, in spite of toxins produced by these amphibians, and they  may be a significant factor in the loss of newts from several streams  in southern California (Gamradt and Kats 1996). These crayfish have  been found at both the FEMA/Broadmore North and Hall Road Preserves. At  the FEMA property, crayfish were found in the pool (D. Cook, pers.  comm., 2002). The crayfish likely came from the adjacent Roseland Creek  Channel. Louisiana crayfish have been found in the ditches that cross  the Hall Road Preserve, but not at any of the pools known to support  Sonoma County California tiger salamander populations (D. Cook, pers.  comm., 2002). The presence of both stickleback and crayfish, along with  the suspected presence of bullfrogs, could affect the Hall Road  Preserve. The Hall Road Preserve is one of only two breeding sites that  still contain pools with migration corridors that accommodate the  transfer of genetic material between pools, while also allowing for the  repopulation of individual pools in the event of a randomly occurring  catastrophic event.     California tiger salamander larvae also are preyed upon by many  native species. In healthy salamander populations, such predation is  probably not a significant threat. But when combined with other  impacts, such as predation by non-native species, contaminants,  migration barriers, or habitat alteration, it may cause a significant  decrease in population viability. Native predators include great blue  herons (Ardea herodias) and egrets, western pond turtles (Clemmys  marmorata), various garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.), larger California  tiger salamander larvae, larger spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus hammondii)  larvae, and California red-legged frogs (Mike Peters, Service, in  litt., 1993; Hansen and Tremper 1993).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The primary cause of the decline of the Sonoma County California  tiger salamander is the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of habitat  from human activities. Federal, State, and local laws have been  insufficient to prevent past and ongoing losses of the limited habitat  of the Sonoma County California tiger salamander. Federal     Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 U.S.C. 1344 et  seq.), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates the discharge  of fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands.  Section 404 regulations require applicants to obtain a permit for  projects that involve the discharge of fill material into waters of the  United States, including wetlands. However, normal farming activities  are exempt under the CWA and do not require a permit (53 FR 20764;  Robert Wayland III, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in litt.,  1996). Projects  [[Page 47734]]  that are subject to regulation may qualify for authorization to place  fill material into headwaters and isolated waters, including wetlands,  under several nationwide permits. The use of nationwide permits by an  applicant or project proponent is normally authorized with minimal  environmental review by the Corps. No activity that is likely to  jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered  species, or that is likely to destroy or adversely modify designated  critical habitat of such species, is authorized under any nationwide  permit. An individual permit may be required by the Corps if a project  otherwise qualifying under a nationwide permit would have greater than  minimal adverse environmental impacts.     Three federally endangered plants, Sonoma sunshine (Blennosperma  bakeri), Sebastopol meadowfoam (Limnanthes vinculans), and Burke's  goldfields (Lasthenia burkei) occur on the Santa Rosa Plain of Sonoma  County in the vicinity of Sonoma County California tiger salamander.  However, little overlap occurs between the viable breeding sites of  this species and these federally listed vernal pool species. Any Corps  consultation requirement for fill of pools on the Santa Rosa Plain  would be triggered by the listed plants. Since the salamander and the  federally listed plants do not substantially overlap, salamander  breeding pools are unlikely to be protected by presence of the plants  or their habitat. Furthermore, even if breeding pools of this animal  are avoided due to the presence of a federally listed plant species,  this protection may only extend to the pool itself with a small upland  buffer. Since Sonoma County California tiger salamanders spend up to 80  percent of their life in small mammal burrows in upland habitats  surrounding breeding pools, the protection of the pool itself, with  concurrent loss of uplands surrounding the pool, would still result in  the loss of local Sonoma County California tiger salamander breeding  sites.     Recent court cases may further limit the Corps' ability to utilize  the CWA to regulate the fill or discharge of fill or dredged material  into the aquatic environment within the current range of the Sonoma  County California tiger salamander (Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook  County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001) (SWANCC)).  The effect of SWANCC on Federal regulation of activities in wetlands in  the area of the Sonoma County California tiger salamander has recently  become clear by the Corps' failure to assert its jurisdiction over fill  of several wetlands within the range of the Sonoma county California  tiger salamander. In a letter from the Corps dated March 8, 2002,  concerning the fill of 0.18 ha (0.45 ac) of seasonal wetlands southwest  of the intersection of Piner and Marlow Roads (Corps File Number  19736N), the Corps referenced the SWANCC decision and reiterated that  the subject wetlands were not ``waters of the United States'' because  they were: (1) Not navigable waters; (2) not interstate waters; (3) not  part of a tributary system to 1 or 2; (4) not wetlands adjacent to any  of the foregoing; and (5) not an impoundment of any of the above. The  letter further stated that the interstate commerce nexus to these  particular waters is insufficient to establish CWA jurisdiction, and  therefore, not subject to regulation by the Corps under section 404 of  the CWA. The Corps also cited the SWANCC decision as their reasoning  for not taking jurisdiction over fill of Sonoma County California tiger  salamander breeding pools at the recently constructed South Sonoma  Business Park. State     The CDFG recognizes the California tiger salamander as a species of  special concern. This designation does not provide the species with any  protection from actions that injure or kill them, or damage or destroy  their habitat. The California tiger salamander is not protected under  the California Endangered Species Act.     The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources  Code Sec. 21000-21177) requires a full disclosure of the potential  environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with  primary authority or jurisdiction over a project is designated as the  lead agency and is responsible for conducting a review of the project  and consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources  affected by the project. Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines, as  amended, requires a finding of significance if a project has the  potential to ``reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or  endangered plant or animal.'' Once significant effects are identified,  the lead agency has the option of requiring mitigation for effects  through changes in the project or to decide that overriding  considerations make mitigation infeasible (CEQA Sec. 21002). In the  latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant  environmental damage, such as destruction of listed endangered species  and/or their habitat. Protection of listed species through CEQA is,  therefore, dependent upon the discretion of the lead agency involved. Local     We are not aware of any specific county or city ordinances that  provide protection for the Sonoma County California tiger salamander.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence      Several other factors, including contaminants, ground squirrel and  gopher control, hybridization with non-native salamanders, predation,  and competition with introduced species may have negative effects on  California tiger salamanders and their aquatic and upland habitats.  These factors are discussed below. Contaminants     Sonoma County California tiger salamanders probably are exposed to  a variety of pesticides and other chemicals throughout their range.  Sonoma County California tiger salamanders also could die from  starvation by the loss of their prey base. Hydrocarbon and other  contamination from oil production and road runoff; the application of  numerous chemicals for roadside maintenance; urban/suburban landscape  maintenance; and rodent and vector control programs may all have  negative effects on tiger salamander populations, as detailed below.     Road mortality is not the only risk factor associated with roads,  as oil and other contaminants in runoff have been detected in adjacent  ponds and linked to die-offs and deformities in California tiger  salamanders and spadefoot toads, and die-offs of invertebrates that  form most of both species' prey base (S. Sweet, in litt., 1993).  Lefcort et al. (1997) found that oil had limited direct effects on 5- week-old marbled (Ambystoma opacum) and tiger salamanders (A. t.  tigrinum). However, it was found that salamanders from oil-contaminated  natural ponds metamorphosed earlier at smaller sizes, and those from  oil-contaminated artificial ponds had slower growth rates, than larvae  raised in non-contaminated ponds. Their studies did not address effects  on eggs and early larval stages, where the effects may be more  pronounced.     Hatch and Burton (1998) and Monson et al. (1999) investigated the  effects of one component of petroleum products and urban runoff  (fluoranthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) on spotted  salamanders (A. maculatum), northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), and  African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). In laboratory and outdoor  experiments, using levels of the  [[Page 47735]]  contaminant comparable to those found in service station and other  urban runoff, the researchers found reduced survival and growth  abnormalities in all species and that the effects were worse when the  larvae were exposed to the contaminant under natural levels of  sunlight, rather than in the laboratory under artificial light. In  Sonoma County, there are a number of records of California tiger  salamanders using roadside ditches. Many are in areas where there are  no known breeding ponds, and these animals are utilizing the only  marginal habitat remaining. Also, many pools in these areas have likely  been destroyed, leaving these marginal sites as the only option for  breeding. In light of the increased urbanization occurring in this  area, with concurrent increases in traffic, the risk factor associated  with contaminants in runoff likely will rise in both roadside ditches  and across the general landscape. Agricultural and Landscaping Contaminants     In Sonoma County, over 1.4 million kilograms (3.1 million pounds)  of agricultural chemicals were used in 2000 on grapes, apples, rights  of way, structural pest control, and landscape maintenance (California  Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), Internet Website). Chemical  use occurring on or near tiger salamander breeding sites in Sonoma  County is primarily associated with rights of way, structural pest  control, and landscape maintenance. These chemicals included metam- sodium, methyl bromide, mancozeb, petroleum oil, phosmet, chlorpyrifos,  pendimethalin, parathion, paraquat dichloride, fosetyl-aluminum,  acephate, cryolite, and malathion, some of which are extremely toxic to  aquatic organisms, such as amphibians and the organisms on which they  prey.     Even if toxic or detectable amounts of pesticides are not found in  the breeding ponds or groundwater, salamanders may still be affected,  particularly when chemicals are applied during the migration and  dispersal seasons. All of the remaining seven documented salamander  breeding sites in Sonoma County may be directly or indirectly affected  by toxic landscaping chemicals due to the presence of housing  developments within their drainage basins. Rodent Control     California tiger salamanders spend much of their lives estivating  in underground retreats, typically in the burrows of ground squirrels  and gophers (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a). Widespread ground  squirrel control programs were begun in California as early as 1910,  and are carried out on more than 4 million ha (9.9 million ac) in  California (Marsh 1987). It is unclear how effective such control  programs were in reducing ground squirrel populations. According to  Marsh (1987), when a ground squirrel population is at or near carrying  capacity, it must be reduced by at least 90 percent annually for  several years to significantly reduce the population. However, it may  not be practical to attain such high reduction rates over large areas  of rangelands, but it may be possible to reduce populations to low  numbers (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). In some primarily agricultural  counties, the ground squirrel population has been reduced and  maintained at perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the carrying capacity. Rodent  control programs are conducted by individual land owners and managers  on grazing, vineyard, and crop production lands (Rosemary Thompson,  Science Applications International Corporation, in litt., 1998).     Pocket gopher and ground squirrel burrows are most often used by  California tiger salamanders in Sonoma County (D. Cook, pers. comm.,  2001). Both of these animals are classified as nongame mammals by CDFG.  This means that if they are found to be injuring growing crops or other  property, including garden and landscape plants, they may be controlled  at any time and in any legal manner by the owner or the tenant of the  premises (University of California Integrated Pest Management (UCIPM),  internet website 2002).     Legal methods of pocket gopher control include trapping,  strychnine-treated grain bait, and anticoagulant baits. Poisoned grains  (anticoagulant baits) are the most common method used to control ground  squirrels around homes and other areas where children, pets, and  poultry are present (UCIPM 2002; Jon Shelgrin, CDPR, pers. comm.,  2002). Zinc phosphide is highly toxic to freshwater fish and to non- target mammals (EXOTONET 1996). Zinc phosphide, a rodenticide and  restricted material, turns into phosgene gas, a toxic gas once ingested  by the rodents. There is little risk of California tiger salamanders  ingesting any of these baits; however the use of these grains may  impact the California tiger salamanders indirectly if washed into  burrows or ponds used by the species.     Two of the most commonly used rodenticides, chlorophacinone and  diphacinone, are anticoagulants that cause animals to bleed to death.  They can be absorbed through the skin and are considered toxic to fish  and wildlife (EPA 1985; Extension Toxicology Network (EXTOXNET) 1999).  These two chemicals, along with strychnine, are used in Sonoma County  to control rodents (R. Thompson, in litt., 1998). Although the effects  of these poisons on California tiger salamanders have not been  assessed, use along roadways or surrounding residential areas may  result in contamination of salamander breeding ponds, with undetermined  effects. Gases, including aluminum phosphide, carbon monoxide, and  methyl bromide, can be introduced into burrows either by using  cartridges or by pumping. When such fumigants are used, all animals  inhabiting the burrow are killed (Salmon and Schmidt 1984).     In addition to possible direct effects of rodent control chemicals,  control programs probably have an adverse indirect effect on California  tiger salamander populations. Control of ground squirrels could  significantly reduce the number of burrows available for use by the  Sonoma County California tiger salamander (Loredo-Prendeville et al.  1994). All of the remaining Sonoma County California tiger salamander  breeding locations exist in areas that are likely to experience a  heightened degree of rodent control due to landscaping concerns  surrounding residential developments. Because the burrow density  required to support California tiger salamanders in an area is not  known, the loss of burrows as a result of control programs cannot be  quantified at this time. However, Shaffer et al. (1993) stated that  rodent control programs may be responsible for the lack of California  tiger salamanders in some areas. Active ground squirrel colonies  probably are needed to sustain tiger salamanders because inactive  burrow systems become progressively unsuitable over time. Loredo et al.  (1996) found that burrow systems collapsed within 18 months following  abandonment by or loss of the ground squirrels. Although the  researchers found that California tiger salamanders used both occupied  and unoccupied burrows, they did not indicate that the salamanders used  collapsed burrows. Rodent control programs must be analyzed and  implemented carefully in California tiger salamander habitat so the  persistence of the animals is not threatened. One of the remaining  Sonoma County California tiger salamander sites is currently occupied  by cattle. Most owners of livestock seek to eliminate ground squirrel  burrows because of the threat of cows (Bos bos) breaking their legs if  they accidentally step into a burrow.  [[Page 47736]]  Mosquito Control     A commonly used method to control mosquitoes, used in Sonoma County  (Marin/Sonoma Mosquito and Vector Control District, internet website  2002), is the application of methoprene, which increases the level of  juvenile hormone in insect larvae and disrupts the molting process.  Lawrenz (1984) found that methoprene (Altosid SR-10) retarded the  development of selected crustacea that had the same molting hormones  (i.e., juvenile hormone) as insects, and anticipated that the same  hormone may control metamorphosis in other arthropods. Because the  success of many aquatic vertebrates relies on an abundance of  invertebrates in temporary wetlands, any delay in insect growth could  reduce the numbers and density of prey available (Lawrenz 1984). The  use of methoprene could have an indirect adverse effect on the  California tiger salamander by reducing the availability of prey. In  more recent studies, methoprene did not cause increased mortality of  gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles (Sparling and Lowe 1998).  However, it caused reduced survival rates and increased malformations  in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) (Ankley et al. 1998), and  increased malformations in southern leopard frogs (R. utricularia)  (Sparling 1998). Blumberg et al. (1998) correlated exposure to  methoprene with delayed metamorphosis and high mortality rates in  northern leopard and mink (R. septentrionalis) frogs. Methoprene  appears to have both direct and indirect effects on the growth and  survival of larval amphibians. Introduced Species     Introduced species can have negative effects on California tiger  salamander populations through competition and hybridization (Shaffer  et al. 1993; H. Bradley Shaffer, UCD, in litt., 1999). Competition from  fish that prey on mosquito larvae and other invertebrates can reduce  the survival of salamanders. Both California tiger salamanders  (Stebbins 1962; J. D. Anderson 1968; Holomuzki 1986) and mosquito fish  feed on micro- and macro-invertebrates; large numbers of mosquito fish  may out-compete the salamander larvae for food (Graf 1993). As urban  areas continue to expand, the introduction of mosquito fish into  previously untreated ponds may result in the elimination of California  tiger salamanders from additional breeding sites. The introduction of  other fish either inadvertently or for recreational fishing or other  purposes may also affect the prey base, reducing growth and survival  rates of salamanders. They may also prey on tiger salamander larvae,  reducing or eliminating populations (Shaffer et al. 1993).     The practice of importing the non-native tiger salamander for fish  bait is no longer legal in California (CCR Title 14, Division 1,  Subdivision 1, Chapter 2, Article 3, Section 4 2000). Non-native tiger  salamanders have been documented in Sonoma County, although not in  habitat utilized by California tiger salamanders (Shaffer et al. 1993).  Non-native tiger salamanders were being sold as pets in a store  directly across the street from one of the breeding sites (David  Wooten, Service, pers. obs., 2002). If salamander population ranges  overlap or come in contact through expansion, then hybridization may  occur in closely related species and certain subspecies (Rudd 1955).  Over time, a population of a subspecies could become genetically  indistinguishable from a larger population of an introgressing  subspecies such that the true genotype of the lesser subspecies no  longer exists (Levin 2002). The Sonoma County California tiger  salamander breeding sites in west Santa Rosa may be threatened by  hybridization with non-native tiger salamanders because of the ability  of the animals to disperse over upland areas, or through intentional  introduction to the pools (Cook and Northern 2001).     Introduced salamanders may out-compete the California tiger  salamander, or interbreed with the natives (Bury and Lukenbach 1976;  Shaffer et al. 1993). Evidence suggests that the hybrids are viable,  and that they breed with California tiger salamanders (H. Shaffer in  litt., 1999). With so few remaining breeding sites of California tiger  salamanders in Sonoma County, the loss of any to hybridization, with or  competition from, introduced species is of serious concern. Grazing     Grazing in many cases has positive, or at least neutral, effects on  the California tiger salamander (H. B. Shaffer and Peter Trenham, UCD,  pers. comm., 1998; S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1998, 1999). By keeping  vegetation shorter, grazing can make areas more suitable for ground  squirrels, whose burrows are used by California tiger salamanders. Only  one of the seven viable Sonoma County California tiger salamander  breeding locations is currently being grazed. However, cattle drink  large quantities of water, sometimes causing temporary pools to dry  faster than they otherwise would (Sheri Melanson, Service, in litt.,  1993), and possibly causing breeding pools to dry too quickly for  salamanders to be able to metamorphose (Feaver 1971). Melanson (1993)  noted that although vernal pool species continued to reproduce under a  November-to-April grazing regime, California tiger salamanders were  either absent or found in low numbers in portions of pools that were  heavily trampled by cattle. Continued trampling of a pond's edge by  cattle can increase the surface area of a pond, and may increase water  temperature and speed up the rate of evaporation and thus reduce the  amount of time the pond contains enough water (S. Sweet, pers. comm.,  1998).     Reduction in water quality caused by cattle excrement may  negatively affect the California tiger salamanders by increasing  nitrogen levels. High nitrogen levels have been associated with blooms  of bacteria (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), and silt has been associated  with fatal fungal infections (Lefcort et al. 1997) (see Factor C of  this section). However, grazing generally is compatible with the  continued use of rangelands by the California tiger salamander as long  as intensive burrowing rodent control programs are not implemented on  such areas, and grazing is not excessive (Thomas Jones, University of  Michigan, in litt., 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993; S. Sweet, pers. comm.,  1998, 1999). Population Size     The low numbers of Sonoma County California tiger salamander make  it vulnerable to risks associated with small, restricted populations.  The elements of risk that are amplified in very small populations  include: (1) The impact of high death rates or low birth rates; (2) the  effects of genetic drift (random fluctuations in gene frequencies) and  inbreeding (mating among close relatives); and (3) deterioration in  environmental quality (Gilpin and Soule 1986). Genetic drift and  inbreeding may lead to reductions in the ability of individuals to  survive and reproduce (i.e., reductions in fitness) in small  populations. In addition, reduced genetic variation in small  populations may make any species less able to successfully adapt to  future environmental changes (Shaffer 1981, 1987; Noss and Cooperrider  1994; Primack 1998).  Reason for Emergency Determination      Under section 4(b)(7) of the Act, and regulations at 50 CFR 424.20,  we must consider development of an emergency rule to list a species if  the threats to the species constitute an emergency posing a significant  risk to its continuing survival. Such an emergency listing  [[Page 47737]]  becomes effective upon publication in the Federal Register and expires  240 days following publication in the Federal Register unless, during  this 240-day period, we list the species following the normal listing  procedures. We discuss the reasons why emergency listing the Sonoma  County California tiger salamander as endangered is necessary below. In  accordance with the Act, we will withdraw this emergency rule if, at  any time after its publication, we determine that substantial evidence  does not exist to warrant such a rule.     In making this determination, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the Sonoma County California tiger  salamander. As discussed in the Summary of Factors Affecting the  Species, the species faces a number of threats. These include habitat  destruction, degradation, and fragmentation, collection, invasive  exotic species, pesticides, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms. The  Sonoma County California tiger salamander also is vulnerable to chance  environmental or demographic events, to which small populations are  particularly vulnerable. The combination of only seven known breeding  sites, small range on the Santa Rosa Plain, and restricted habitat  makes the animal highly susceptible to random events, such as drought,  disease, and other occurrences.     Drought conditions in the last two years have resulting in many of  these ponds drying up earlier in the season than expected. Only three  pools were wet long enough to allow for recruitment in 2001. Any  extended drought could result in such low numbers of individuals that  recovery would be precluded.     Because the Sonoma County California tiger salamander has been  reduced to only seven known breeding sites, and all of them are subject  to various immediate, ongoing, and future threats as outlined above, we  find that the Sonoma County California tiger salamander is in imminent  danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its  range and warrants immediate protection under the Act. Emergency  listing the Sonoma County California tiger salamander as endangered  will increase the regulatory protections and resources available to the  species.  Critical Habitat      Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as the--(i)  Specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at  the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found  those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation  of the species, and (II) that may require special management  considerations or protection, and (ii) specific areas outside the  geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed in  accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Act, upon a  determination by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the  conservation of the species. ``Conservation'' means the use of all  methods and procedures needed to bring the species to the point at  which listing under the Act is no longer necessary.     Section 4(a)(3) of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR  424.12) require that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable,  the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) designate critical habitat at  the time the species is determined to be endangered or threatened. Our  implementing regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)) state that critical habitat  is not determinable if information sufficient to perform the required  analysis of impacts of the designation is lacking, or if the biological  needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to allow  identification of an area as critical habitat. Section 4(b)(2) of the  Act requires us to consider economic and other relevant impacts of  designating a particular area as critical habitat on the basis of the  best scientific data available. The Secretary may exclude any area from  critical habitat if she determines that the benefits of such exclusion  outweigh the conservation benefits, unless to do so would result in the  extinction of the species. In the absence of a finding that critical  habitat would increase threats to a species, if any benefits would  derive from critical habitat designation, then a prudent finding is  warranted. In the case of this species, designation of critical habitat  may provide some benefits.     The primary regulatory effect of critical habitat is the section 7  requirement that agencies refrain from taking any action that destroys  or adversely modifies critical habitat. While a critical habitat  designation for habitat currently occupied by this species would not be  likely to change the section 7 consultation outcome because an action  that destroys or adversely modifies such critical habitat would also be  likely to result in jeopardy to the species, there may be instances  where section 7 consultation would be triggered only if critical  habitat is designated. Examples could include unoccupied habitat or  occupied habitat that may become unoccupied in the future. Designating  critical habitat may also produce some educational or informational  benefits. Therefore, designation of critical habitat for the Sonoma  County California tiger salamander is prudent.     However, our budget for listing activities is currently  insufficient to allow us to immediately complete all the listing  actions required by the Act. Not designating critical habitat at this  time allows us to provide the necessary protections needed for the  conservation of the species without further delay. This is consistent  with section 4(b)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, which states that final listing  decisions may be issued without critical habitat designations when it  is essential that such determinations be promptly published. The  legislative history of the 1982 Act amendments also emphasized this  point: ``The Committee feels strongly, however, that, where biology  relating to the status of the species is clear, it should not be denied  the protection of the Act because of the inability of the Secretary to  complete the work necessary to designate critical habitat. * * * The  committee expects the agencies to make the strongest attempt possible  to determine critical habitat within the time period designated for  listing, but stresses that the listing of species is not to be delayed  in any instance past the time period allocated for such listing if the  biological data is clear but the habitat designation process is not  complete'' (H.R. Rep. No. 97-567 at 20 (1982)). We will prepare a  critical habitat designation in the future when our available resources  allow.     We will protect the Sonoma County California tiger salamander and  its habitat through section 7 consultations to determine whether  Federal actions are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the  subspecies, through the recovery process, through enforcement of take  prohibitions under section 9 of the Act, and through the section 10  process for activities on non-Federal lands with no Federal nexus.  Available Conservation Measures      Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  practices. Recognition through listing encourages conservation actions  by Federal, State, and local agencies. The Act provides for possible  land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that  recovery actions be carried out for listed species. We discuss the  protection of Federal agencies, considerations for  [[Page 47738]]  protection and conservation actions, and the prohibitions against  taking and harm for the Sonoma County California tiger salamander, in  part, below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed to  be listed or is listed as endangered or threatened, and with respect to  its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations  implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are  codified at 50 CFR part 402. Federal agencies are required to confer  with us informally on any action that is likely to jeopardize the  continued existence of a proposed species, or result in destruction or  adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is  listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to  ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not  likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to  destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal agency  action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the  responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with us.  Federal agency actions that may affect the Sonoma County California  tiger salamanders and may require consultation with us include, but are  not limited to, those within the jurisdiction of the Corps, Natural  Resources Conservation Service, Federal Farm Bureau, and Federal  Highway Administration (FHA).     We believe that protection and recovery of the Sonoma County  California tiger salamander will require reduction of the threats from  destruction and degradation of wetland and associated upland habitats  due to urban development, exotic predators, unnecessary ground squirrel  and gopher control, and road construction. Threats from collection and  pesticide drift also must be reduced. These threats should be  considered when management actions are taken in habitats currently and  potentially occupied by the Sonoma County California tiger salamander,  and areas deemed important for dispersal and connectivity or corridors  between known locations of this species. Monitoring also should be  undertaken for any management actions or scientific investigations  designed to address these threats or their impacts.     Listing the Sonoma County California tiger salamander provides for  the development and implementation of a recovery plan for the species.  This plan will bring together Federal, State, and regional agency  efforts for the conservation of the species. A recovery plan will  establish a framework for agencies to coordinate their recovery  efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and estimate the costs  of the tasks necessary to accomplish the priorities. It also will  describe the site-specific actions necessary to achieve conservation  and survival of the species.     Listing also will require us to review any actions that may affect  the Sonoma County California tiger salamander for lands and activities  under Federal jurisdiction, State plans developed pursuant to section 6  of the Act, scientific investigations of efforts to enhance the  propagation or survival of the animal, pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A)  of the Act, and habitat conservation plans prepared for non-Federal  lands and activities pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act.     Federal agencies with management responsibility for the Sonoma  County California tiger salamander include the Service, in relation to  the issuance of section 10(a)(1)(A and B) permits for habitat  conservation plans and other programs. Occurrences of this species  could potentially be affected by projects requiring a permit from the  Corps under section 404 of the CWA. The Corps is required to consult  with us on applications they receive for projects that may affect  listed species. Highway construction and maintenance projects that  receive funding from the FHA would be subject to review under section 7  of the Act. In addition, activities that are authorized, funded, or  administered by Federal agencies on non-Federal lands will be subject  to section 7 review.     The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set  forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, codified at 50 CFR 17.21, in  part make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the  United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot,  wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect; or attempt any such conduct),  import, export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the  course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate  or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,  sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has  been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to our agents and State  conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving endangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations  governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits  are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or  survival of the species, and for incidental take in connection with  otherwise lawful activities.     It is our policy, as published in the Federal Register on July 1,  1994 (59 FR 34272), to identify to the maximum extent practicable at  the time a species is listed those activities that would or would not  constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this  policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on  proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range. We believe  that, based on the best available information, the following actions  are not likely to result in a violation of section 9, provided these  actions are carried out in accordance with any existing regulations and  permit requirements:     (1) Possession, delivery, including interstate transport and import  or export from the United States, involving no commercial activity, of  Sonoma County California tiger salamanders that were collected prior to  the date of publication of this emergency listing rule in the Federal  Register;     (2) Any actions that may affect the Sonoma County California tiger  salamander that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal  agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with the  consultation requirements for listed species pursuant to section 7 of  the Act;     (3) Any action taken for scientific research carried out under a  recovery permit issued by the Service pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A)  of the Act; and     (4) Land actions or management carried out under a habitat  conservation plan approved by the Service pursuant to section  10(a)(1)(B) of the Act, or an approved conservation agreement.     Activities that we believe could potentially result in a violation  of section 9 of the Act include, but are not limited to:     (1) Unauthorized possession, collecting, trapping, capturing,  killing, harassing, sale, delivery, or movement, including intrastate,  interstate, and foreign commerce, or harming, or attempting any of  these actions, of Sonoma County California tiger salamanders. Research  activities where salamanders are trapped or captured will require a  permit under section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act;     (2) Activities authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal  agencies that may affect the Sonoma County California tiger salamander,  or its habitat, when such activities are not conducted in accordance  with the consultation for listed species under section 7 of the Act;  [[Page 47739]]      (3) Discharges or dumping of toxic chemicals, silt, or other  pollutants into, or other alteration of the quality of waters  supporting Sonoma County California tiger salamanders that results in  death or injury of the species or that results in degradation of their  occupied habitat;     (4) Release of exotic species (including, but not limited to,  bullfrogs, tiger salamanders, mosquito fish, bass, sunfish, bullhead,  catfish, crayfish) into Sonoma County California tiger salamander  breeding habitat;     (5) Destruction or alteration of uplands associated with seasonal  pools used by Sonoma County California tiger salamanders during  estivation and dispersal, or modification of migration routes such that  migration and dispersal are reduced or precluded; and     (6) Activities (e.g., habitat conversion, excessive livestock  grazing, road and trail construction, recreation, development, and  unauthorized application of herbicides and pesticides in violation of  label restrictions) that directly or indirectly result in the death or  injury of larvae, sub-adult, or adult Sonoma County California tiger  salamanders, or modify Sonoma County California tiger salamander  habitat and significantly affect their essential behavioral patterns  including breeding, foraging, sheltering, or other life functions.  Otherwise lawful activities that incidentally take Sonoma County  California tiger salamanders, but have no Federal nexus, will require a  permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act.     Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a  violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of  the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION  CONTACT section). Requests for copies of the regulations regarding  listed species and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be  addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species  Permits, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, OR 97232-4181 (503/231-2063;  facsimile 503/231-6243).  National Environmental Policy Act      We have determined that an Environmental Assessment and  Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in  connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the  Endangered Species Act as amended. We published a notice outlining our  reasons for this determination in the Federal Register on October 25,  1983 (48 FR 49244).  Paperwork Reduction Act      This rule does not contain any new collections of information other  than those already approved by the Office of Management and Budget  under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned  control number 1018-0094, which is valid through July 31, 2004. This  rule will not impose record keeping or reporting requirements on State  or local governments, individuals, businesses, or organizations. An  agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to  respond to a collection of information, unless it displays a currently  valid control number.  Executive Order 13211      On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O.  13211) on regulations that significantly affect energy supply,  distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to  prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions.  This rule is not expected to significantly affect energy supplies,  distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a significant  energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required.

ACTION: Notice of 90-day petition finding and initiation of status  review.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a  90-day finding for a petition to list the western gray squirrel  (Sciurus griseus griseus) in Washington under the Endangered Species  Act of 1973, as amended. After reviewing the petition and all available  scientific and commercial information, we find that the petition  presents substantial information indicating that there may be one or  more distinct population segments (DPS) of western gray squirrels in  Washington for which listing may be warranted. With the publication of  this notice, we are initiating a status review of the western gray  squirrel subspecies Sciurus griseus griseus in Washington. In addition  to requesting information on the status of the western gray squirrel in  Washington, we are requesting information on the subspecies rangewide  for the purpose of determining if one or more of the Washington  populations of this subspecies constitutes a DPS, or constitutes a  significant portion of the range of the subspecies. We will prepare a  12-month finding on our determination.  DATES: The finding announced in this document was made on October 17,  2002. To be considered in the 12-month finding for this petition,  comments and information should be submitted to us by December 30,  2002.  ADDRESSES: Submit information, comments, or questions concerning this  petition finding to the Manager, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  Western Washington Fish and Wildlife Office, 510 Desmond Drive SE,  Suite 102, Lacey, WA 98503. The petition, supporting information, and  comments are available for public inspection, by appointment, during  normal business hours at the above address.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ken Berg, Manager (see ADDRESSES  section) (telephone 360/753-9440; facsimile 360/753-9518).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(3)(A)), requires us to make a finding  on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents  substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the  petitioned action may be warranted. This finding is to be based on all  information available to us at the time the finding is made. To the  maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days  of the date the petition was received, and a notice of the finding is  to be published promptly in the Federal Register. If the finding is  that substantial information was presented, we are required to promptly  commence a review of the status of the involved species, if one has not  already been initiated under our internal candidate process. After  completing the status review, we will issue an additional finding (the  12-month finding) determining whether listing is, in fact, warranted.     On January 4, 2001, we received a petition dated December 29, 2000,  from the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, Bellingham, Washington, and the  Tahoma Audubon Society, University Place, Washington. The petition and  cover letter clearly identified itself as such and contained the names,  addresses, and signatures of the petitioning organizations'  representatives. Information relating to the taxonomy, the historic and  present population status and trends, threats, and a discussion of the  qualifications of the western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus griseus)  in Washington as a distinct vertebrate population segment (DPS) were  included in the petition. The petition requested an emergency rule to  list the Washington population(s) of the western gray squirrel as  threatened or endangered under the Act or, as an alternative, the  immediate emergency listing of just the southern Puget Sound population  of western gray squirrels followed by a later consideration of the  ``full Washington State distinct population segment under the standard  processing requirements.'' The petition also requested the designation  of critical habitat for the western gray squirrel in Washington,  coincident with the listing.     In a letter dated March 9, 2001, we acknowledged receipt of the  petition (Service, in litt., 2001). We stated that we were unable to  address the petition at that time because we were required to spend  nearly all of our listing and critical habitat funding for fiscal year  2001 to comply with court orders and judicially approved settlement  agreements. We also indicated in our letter that, from our initial  review of the petition, there was no emergency situation for Washington  population(s) of the western gray squirrel. The proposed construction  of the Cross-Base Highway, identified by the petitioners as an imminent  threat to the Puget Sound population, was not scheduled to be  constructed for at least 5 years.     On May 6, 2002, we received a 60-day Notice of Intent to sue from  the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance and Tahoma Audubon Society  (plaintiffs) alleging we had violated the Act by failing to make a  finding on whether the petition to list the Washington population(s) of  the western gray squirrel presented substantial information indicating  that listing may be warranted. On July 17, 2002, the plaintiffs  filed  a  lawsuit in United States District Court for the District of Oregon to  compel us to comply with the listing requirements of the Act. We are  making this 90-day petition finding in accordance with the court's  order in this case, Northwest Ecosystem Alliance and Tahoma Audubon  Society v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Badgely, Williams, and  Norton, No. CV  02 -945 (D. OR.).     The western gray squirrel belongs to the mammalian order Rodentia,  the suborder Sciurognathi, and the family Sciuridae. There are three  subspecies of western gray squirrel: Sciurus griseus griseus, which  ranges from central Washington to the western Sierra Nevada Range in  central California; Sciurus griseus anthonyi, which ranges from the  southern tip of the California Coast Range into south-central  California; and Sciurus griseus nigripes, which ranges from south of  San Francisco Bay in the central California Coast Range to San Luis  Obispo County (Hall 1981). Sciurus griseus griseus was described from a  squirrel seen by Lewis and Clark at the Dalles in Wasco County, Oregon  (Rodrick 1987).     The western gray squirrel is the largest native tree squirrel in  the Pacific Northwest and is the only member of the genus Sciurus  native to Washington. Two other members of the genus found in  Washington are introduced species: the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus  carolinensis) and the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) (Washington  Department of Wildlife (WDW) 1993). Other common names applied to the  western gray squirrel include the silver gray squirrel, California gray  squirrel, Oregon gray squirrel, Columbian gray squirrel,  [[Page 65932]]  and gray squirrel (Northwest Ecosystem Alliance and Tahoma Audubon  Society 2000).     The historic distribution of the western gray squirrel was once  widespread throughout Washington, Oregon, California, and in western  Nevada along the base of the Carson Range and in Washoe County (Linders  2000). Currently, the species is rare in Nevada. Western gray squirrels  in California still occur in the interior valley margin of the  Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi, Little San Bernardino, Santa Rosa,  and Laguna Mountains, and west through the Coast Range to the Pacific  Coast (Carraway and Verts 1994). In Oregon, the western gray squirrel  distribution extends along the southwestern foothills of the Coast  Range northward to Coos Bay, north along the eastern side of the Coast  Range and along both sides of the Cascades into Washington (Verts and  Carraway 1998).  Washington Western Gray Squirrel Populations      Historically, western gray squirrels probably ranged throughout  western Washington and the Cascades in association with oak  communities. One hypothesis suggests that the western gray squirrel  migrated northward into Washington with the spread of Oregon white  (Garry) oak (Quercus garryana) from the Willamette Valley in Oregon.  Consequently, the species was more widely distributed in prehistoric  times and has diminished in recent times along with the decrease in  distribution of oak woodlands (WDW 1993). Western gray squirrels in  Washington once ranged from southern Puget Sound south to the Columbia  River, east along the Columbia River Gorge in the southern Cascades,  and north along the eastern slopes of the Cascades to Lake Chelan.  Documentation for western gray squirrels includes records for Whatcom,  Pierce, Thurston, Grays Harbor, Lewis, Clark, Skamania, Klickitat,  Yakima, Kittitas, Chelan, and Okanogan counties in Washington (WDW  1993; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife 1998). The subspecies'  range extensions into Chelan and Okanogan counties, beyond the range of  Oregon white oak, may have resulted from plantings of walnut trees by  early settlers. The range extension north into Okanogan County occurred  since 1965 (WDW 1993). Currently, in Washington, only three  geographically isolated western gray squirrels remain: one in Thurston  and Pierce counties, one in Klickitat and Yakima counties, and one in  Chelan and Okanogan counties (Bayrakci 1999; Linders 2000; WDW 1993).  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment      We must consider any species for listing under the Act if there is  sufficient information to indicate such action may be warranted.  ``Species'' is defined by the Act as including any subspecies of fish  and wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of  vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature (16 U.S.C.  1532 (16)). We, along with the National Marine Fisheries Service  (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Fisheries), developed  the Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population  Segments (DPS Policy) (61 FR 4722) to help us in determining what  constitutes a distinct population segment (DPS). Under this policy, we  use three elements to assess whether a population under consideration  for listing may be recognized as a DPS: (1) Discreteness of the  population in relation to the remainder of the species to which it  belongs; (2) the significance of the population segment to the species  to which it belongs; and (3) the population segment's conservation  status in relation to the Act's standards for listing.     The DPS analysis is a stepwise analysis; significance is considered  only when discreteness of the population has been determined, and the  conservation status is considered only when both discreteness and  significance of the population have been established. Discreteness  refers to the isolation of a population from other members of the  species and is based on two criteria: (1) Marked separation from other  populations of the same taxon resulting from physical, physiological,  ecological, or behavioral factors, including genetic discontinuity; or  (2) populations delimited by international boundaries. If the  population is determined to be discrete, we determine significance by  assessing the distinct population segment's importance and/or  contribution to the species throughout its range. Measures of  significance may include, but are not limited to, the following: (1)  Persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting  unusual or unique for the taxon; (2) evidence that loss of the discrete  population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of  the taxon; (3) evidence that the discrete population segment represents  the only surviving natural occurrence of the taxon that may be more  abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic  range; and (4) evidence the discrete population segment differs  markedly from other populations of the taxon in its genetic  characteristics.     If we determine that a population meets the discreteness and  significance criteria for a distinct population segment, we evaluate  the threats to determine if endangered or threatened status based on  the Act's standards is warranted. Endangered means the species is in  danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its  range. Threatened means the species is likely to become endangered  within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion  of its range.     In requesting to list the ``Washington population(s)'' of the  western gray squirrel as threatened or endangered, the petition  describes three small disjunct populations in Washington that ``are  separated by a distance of more than 300 km, and western gray squirrels  are not likely to disperse more than 20 km.'' The degree of isolation  of the three populations described in the petition suggest that  individuals from the three populations would not naturally interbreed.  The petition, however, provides sufficient information on each of the  three Washington populations to indicate that we should consider  whether one or more of these populations may meet the criteria for  listing as a DPS. Threats to some populations of the subspecies include  habitat modification and destruction due to fire suppression, logging,  overgrazing, highway construction, and residential development. Other  threats include fluctuating food supplies, disease, competition, road  kills, and illegal shooting. The subspecies is listed as threatened by  the State of Washington.  Emergency Listing and Critical Habitat Designation      Petitions for emergency listing and concurrent designation of  critical habitat with the listing action, as requested in the petition  to list the Washington population(s) of the western gray squirrel, are  not expressly provided for by the Act. However, we may address the need  for an emergency rule pursuant to section 4(b)(7) of the Act (16 U.S.C.  1533(b)(7). In addition, the Act requests us to designate critical  habitat concurrently with listing a species to the maximum extent  prudent and determinable (16 U.S.C. 1533(a)(3)(A).     We may issue an emergency rule to list a species if threats to the  species constitute an emergency posing significant risk to its  continued survival. We consider a species for emergency listing when  the immediacy of the threat is so great to a significant portion of the  total population that the routine listing  [[Page 65933]]  process is not sufficient to prevent large losses that may result in  extinction.     Upon receipt of the petition, we reviewed the available information  to determine if the existing and foreseeable threats represented an  emergency to the western gray squirrel. The petition identified the  proposed construction of the Cross-Base Highway in Pierce County as  presenting an imminent and significant threat to the well-being of  western gray squirrels in south Puget Sound. Consequently, the  petitioners requested an emergency listing of the Washington  population(s) of the western gray squirrel or, as an alternative,  emergency listing the Puget Sound population ``followed by  consideration of the full Washington State distinct population  segment.''     The currently anticipated schedule for the proposed Cross-Base  Highway indicates the Record of Decision will not be completed until  August 2003. There is limited funding available for project development  beyond the completion of the environmental documentation phase. Before  construction can begin, the project will require 2 years for  engineering design and 2 years for right-of-way acquisition. Although  there will be some overlap in timing, Pierce County anticipates the  necessary time for completion of the three phases will not be less than  about 5 years (T.G. Ballard, County Engineer, Pierce County Public  Works and Utilities, in litt., 2002). Consequently, we have determined  that the Cross-Base Highway does not present an imminent threat to the  southern Puget Sound population of western gray squirrels, and an  emergency listing is not warranted at this time. However, we would  initiate an emergency listing if, at any time, we determine that an  emergency listing of a species, including a DPS, is warranted.  Petition Finding      We have reviewed the petition, the literature cited in the  petition, and other literature and information available in our files.  On the basis of the best scientific and commercial information, we find  the petition presents substantial information that there may be one or  more distinct population segments of western gray squirrels in  Washington for which listing may be warranted.     With the publication of this notice, we are initiating a status  review of Sciurus griseus griseus to determine whether one or more of  this subspecies' populations in Washington constitute a DPS, and if so,  whether listing of such DPS(s) is warranted, not warranted, or  warranted but precluded by other pending proposals.  Public Information Solicited      When we make a finding that sufficient information exists to  indicate that listing a species may be warranted, we are required to  promptly commence a review of the status of the species. To ensure the  status review is complete and based on the best available scientific  and commercial information, we are soliciting information on the  western gray squirrel throughout the subspecies' (Sciurus griseus  griseus) range in Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada.  Information on the status of the subspecies rangewide will assist us in  determining if one or more of the Washington populations of western  gray squirrels meet the distinct vertebrate population segment  criteria, particularly the significance test, or constitute a  significant portion of the range.     We request any additional information, comments, and suggestions  from the public, governmental agencies, the scientific community,  industry, and any other interested parties concerning the status of  this subspecies of western gray squirrel throughout its range in  Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada. We are seeking information  regarding historic and current distribution, habitat use and habitat  conditions, biology and ecology, ongoing conservation measures for the  subspecies and its habitat, and threats to the subspecies and its  habitat. More specifically, for the three Washington populations of the  western gray squirrel, we request any available information on: (1) The  genetics of these populations, as they relate to each other and to the  closest populations in Oregon; (2) the extent to which the two  populations east of the Cascade Range are discrete from each other; (3)  current status and trends of each of these populations; (4) the  presence and status of the subspecies on additional public or private  lands; (5) identification of current specific threats to each of the  populations; and (6) any additional information that will support the  DPS analysis of the significance, as defined in our DPS policy (see  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment section above), of each of these  populations to the subspecies as a whole.     If you wish to comment, you may submit your comments and materials  concerning this finding to the Manager, Western Washington Fish and  Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section). Our practice is to make  comments, including names and home addresses of respondents, available  for public review during regular office hours. Respondents may request  that we withhold a respondent's identity, as allowable by law. If you  wish us to withhold your name or address, you must state this request  prominently at the beginning of your comment. However, we will not  consider anonymous comments. To the extent consistent with applicable  law, we will make all submissions from organizations or businesses, and  from individuals identifying themselves as representatives or officials  of organizations or businesses, available for public inspection in  their entirety. Comments and materials received will be available for  public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the  above address.

ACTION: Notice of document availability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announce the  availability for public review of the Draft Recovery Plan for the  Northern Idaho Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus brunneus;  squirrel). The draft plan includes specific recovery criteria and  measures to be taken in order to delist the squirrel. We solicit review  and comment from local, State, and Federal agencies, and the public on  this draft recovery plan.  DATES: Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or  before September 13 2002, to receive consideration by the Service.  ADDRESSES: Copies of the draft recovery plan are available for  inspection, by appointment, during normal working hours at the  following location: Snake River Fish and Wildlife Office, 1387 S.  Vinnell Way, Suite 368, Boise, Idaho 83709 (Phone: 208-378-5243).  Requests for copies of the draft recovery plan, and written comments  and materials regarding this plan should be addressed to Robert  Ruesink, Field Supervisor, at the above address.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rich Howard, Fish and Wildlife  Biologist, at the above address.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      Recovery of endangered or threatened animals and plants is a  primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species  program. A species is considered recovered when the species' ecosystem  is restored and/or threats to the species are removed so that self- sustaining and self-regulating populations of the species can be  supported as persistent members of native biotic communities. Recovery  plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation of the  species, establish criteria for downlisting or delisting listed  species, and estimate time and cost for implementing the measures  needed for recovery.     The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended in 1988 (Act) (16  U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), requires the development of recovery plans for  listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of  a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act requires that public  notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided  during recovery plan development. We will consider all information  presented during the public comment period prior to approval of this  recovery plan. Substantive technical comments may result in changes to  the plan. Substantive comments regarding recovery plan implementation  will be forwarded to appropriate Federal or other entities for  consideration during the implementation of recovery actions.     The squirrel was listed as a threatened species on April 5, 2000.  This subspecies is endemic to the Weiser and Little Salmon River Basins  in western Idaho. It is distributed in small, isolated populations  across two U.S. Forest Service Districts, and State and private lands  in Adams and Valley Counties of western Idaho. It formerly occurred in  Long Valley and Round Valley of Valley County, but no viable  populations have been documented there within the past 5 years. Twenty- three population sites are considered extant; another 14 have unknown  status or have become extirpated.     Declines in extant population sites and numbers of squirrels are  attributed to the loss and fragmentation of habitat. The squirrel is  dependent on meadow and shrub/grassland, and does well in habitat  bordered by coniferous forests. However, the species becomes extirpated  from areas that develop high densities of small trees. Conifers have  displaced the species' food base, and inhibited or prevented dispersal  of yearlings and adults between population sites. Land conversion from  [[Page 46441]]  meadows and shrub/grasslands to agricultural crops, residential areas,  and recreational facilities has also contributed to the eradication of  local populations of squirrels.     The objective of this plan is to provided a framework for the  recovery of the squirrel so that protection by the Act is no longer  necessary. Recovery is contingent on protecting and managing the  squirrel's habitat to maintain and enhance viable populations through a  range of natural variability.     The squirrel will be considered for delisting when a total of 30  stable population sites are distributed throughout the historic range  of the species. Each population site that has maintained a 5-year  average size of 100 to 500 individuals will be considered stable. At  least 20 of the 30 population sites must be protected. Additionally,  genetic exchange between population sites should be occurring through  dispersal or linkage corridors; a post-delisting monitoring program  should be written and ready to be implemented; and ecological  management of habitats should be initiated for all population sites.      Authority: The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the  Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533 (f).      Dated: May 16, 2002.

ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose  threatened status for the Central California distinct population  segment (DPS) of the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma  californiense), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  amended (Act). The Santa Barbara County and Sonoma County DPSs are  listed as endangered. We propose reclassifying these populations as  threatened. This proposal, if made final, would extend the Federal  protection and recovery provisions of the Act to the Central California  DPS of this species.     A special rule is also being proposed to exempt existing routine  ranching activities from the prohibitions of the Act because these  practices have neutral or beneficial effects on the California tiger  salamander. We solicit additional data and information that may assist  us in making a final decision on this proposed action.  DATES: Comments: We must receive comments from all interested parties  by 5 p.m. on July 22, 2003.     Public Hearings: We will hold public hearings at the following  times:     (1) Tuesday, June 17, 2003--Livermore, California. Two sessions, 1  p.m. until 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. Registration will begin at  12:30 p.m. for the afternoon session and at 5:30 p.m. for the evening  session.     (2) Wednesday, June 18, 2003--Monterey, California. Two sessions, 1  p.m. until 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. Registration will begin at  12:30 p.m. for the afternoon session and at 5:30 p.m. for the evening  session.     (3) Thursday, June 19, 2003--Merced, California.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office,  at the address listed above (telephone 916/414-6600; facsimile 916/414- 6713).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Previous Federal Action      On September 18, 1985, we published the Vertebrate Notice of Review  (NOR) (50 FR 37958), which included the California tiger salamander as  a category 2 candidate species for possible future listing as  threatened or endangered. Category 2 candidates were those taxa for  which information contained in our files indicated that listing may be  appropriate but for which additional data were needed to support a  listing proposal. The January 6, 1989, and November 21, 1991, NORs (54  FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively) also included the California  tiger salamander as a category 2 candidate and solicited information on  the status of the species.     On February 21, 1992, we received a petition to list the California  tiger salamander as an endangered species from Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer  at University of California, Davis. We published a 90-day petition  finding on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), concluding that the  petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may  be warranted. On April 18, 1994, we published a 12-month petition  finding (59 FR 18353) that the listing of the California tiger  salamander was warranted but precluded by higher priority listing  actions. We elevated the species to category 1 status at that time,  which was reflected in the November 15, 1994, NOR (59 FR 58982).  Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which we had on file  sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to  support preparation of listing proposals.     We discontinued the use of different categories of candidates in  the February 28, 1996, NOR (61 FR 7596), and defined ``candidate  species'' as those meeting the definition of former category 1. We  maintained the California tiger salamander as a candidate species in  that NOR, as well as in subsequent NORs published September 19, 1997  (62 FR 49398), October 25, 1999 (64 FR 57533), and October 30, 2001 (66  FR 54808).     On January 19, 2000, we published an emergency rule to list the  Santa Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander as  endangered (65 FR 3096), concurrently with a proposed rule (65 FR 3110)  to list the same DPS as endangered. On September 21, 2000, we listed  the Santa Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander as  endangered (65 FR 57242).     On June 12, 2001, we received a petition dated June 11, 2001, from  the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and Citizens for a  Sustainable Cotati to emergency-list the Sonoma County DPS of the  California tiger salamander as an endangered species and to designate  critical habitat. On February 27, 2002, the CBD filed a complaint in  the Northern District of California for our failure to list the Sonoma  County DPS of the California tiger salamander as endangered (Center for  Biological Diversity v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Case No. C-02- 0558)). On June 6, 2002, based on a settlement agreement with the CBD,  the court issued an order requiring us to submit for Federal Register  publication a proposal and/or emergency rule to list the Sonoma County  DPS by July 15, 2002. We were also to submit for publication in the  Federal Register a proposal to list the California tiger salamander  throughout the remainder of its range (except for the Santa Barbara  County and Sonoma County DPSs) on or before May 15, 2003, and to  publish a  [[Page 28649]]  final rule on or before May 15, 2004. On July 22, 2002, the Sonoma  County DPS was listed as an endangered species under an emergency basis  and proposed for listing as endangered (67 FR 47726; 67 FR 47758). The  final rule listing the Sonoma County DPS as endangered was published in  the Federal Register on March 19, 2003 (68 FR 13498). This proposed  rule to list the Central California tiger salamander complies with the  June 6, 2002, settlement agreement.  Background      The California tiger salamander was first described as Ambystoma  californiense by Gray in 1853 based on specimens that had been  collected in Monterey, California (Grinnell and Camp 1917). Storer  (1925) and Bishop (1943) also considered the California tiger  salamander to be a distinct species. Dunn (1940), Gehlbach (1967), and  Frost (1985) stated the California tiger salamander was a subspecies of  the more widespread tiger salamander (A. tigrinum). However, based on  recent studies of the genetics, geographic distribution, and ecological  differences among the members of the A. tigrinum complex, the  California tiger salamander is now considered to be a distinct species  (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Jones 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993; Shaffer and  McKnight 1996; Irschick and Shaffer 1997; Petranka 1998). The range of  this animal does not naturally overlap with any other species of tiger  salamander (Stebbins 1985; Petranka 1998).     The California tiger salamander is a large and stocky terrestrial  salamander with small eyes and a broad, rounded snout. Adults may reach  a total length of 208 millimeters (mm) (8.2 inches (in)), with males  generally averaging about 203 mm (8 in) in total length, and females  averaging about 173 mm (6.8 in) in total length. For both sexes, the  average snout-vent length is approximately 91 mm (3.6 in). The small  eyes have black irises and protrude from the head. Coloration consists  of white or pale yellow spots or bars on a black background on the back  and sides. The belly varies from almost uniform white or pale yellow to  a variegated pattern of white or pale yellow and black. Males can be  distinguished from females, especially during the breeding season, by  their swollen cloacae (a common chamber into which the intestinal,  urinary, and reproductive canals discharge), more-developed tail fins,  and larger overall size (Stebbins 1962; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996).     California tiger salamanders are restricted to vernal pools and  seasonal ponds in grassland and oak savannah plant communities from sea  level to about 460 meters (m) (1,500 feet (ft)) (Stebbins 1989; Shaffer  et al. 1993; Jennings and Hayes 1994; Petranka 1998; California Natural  Diversity Data Base (CNDDB) 2002). Along the coast ranges, the species  occurs in the Santa Rosa area of Sonoma County, southern San Mateo  County south to central San Luis Obispo County, and the vicinity of  northwestern Santa Barbara County. In the Central Valley and  surrounding Sierra Nevada foothills, the species occurs from northern  Yolo County (Dunnigan) southward to northwestern Kern County and  northern Tulare County. A population of salamanders at Grass Lake in  Siskiyou County (Mullen and Stebbins 1978) has been identified as the  northwestern tiger salamander (A. t. melanostictum) (H. Shaffer,  University of California, Davis, pers. comm. 1998).     Several gaps exist in the distribution of the California tiger  salamander. In the northeastern Sacramento Valley, the species was  known from only one site, in southern Butte County on the Gray Lodge  Waterfowl Management Area, where it has not been located since 1965  despite subsequent surveys (Stebbins 1989; Shaffer et al. 1993).  Although the area between Sacramento and the Cosumnes River contains  suitable vernal pools, and has been surveyed extensively, the species  has only been recorded along the southern edge of Sacramento County  (CNDDB 2002). In a survey transect that extended along the west side of  the Sacramento Valley from Shasta County to Solano County, and  contained 35 kilometers (km) (22 miles (mi)) of vernal pool habitat and  over 200 pools, California tiger salamanders were recorded only at the  Jepson Prairie in Solano County (Simovich et al. 1993). The animal has  not been found west of Interstate Highway 680 and north of Interstate  Highway 580 in Contra Costa or Alameda Counties (LSA Associates, Inc.  2001; CNDDB 2002). It is likely that the species is uncommon or absent  in much of the southernmost San Joaquin Valley from approximately Los  Banos in Merced County south, and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada  south of Visalia in Tulare County, because of unsuitable habitat  (Shaffer et al. 1993). The factors that may restrict the California  tiger salamander in the northern and southern extent of its range are  speculative (H. Shaffer, pers. comm. 2002), but may include low  rainfall in the southern San Joaquin Valley and the greater abundance  of nonnative predatory fish in the northern Sacramento Valley (Hayes  1977). Jones (1989) suggests that the present pattern of disjunct and  widely dispersed populations was caused by the extreme anthropogenic  changes in and around the Central Valley, and by the restrictive  breeding requirements of the species.     Studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicate that there are six  populations of A. californiense, which are found in Sonoma County,  Santa Barbara County, the Bay Area (central and southern Alameda, Santa  Clara, western Stanislaus, western Merced, and the majority of San  Benito Counties), Central Valley (Yolo, Sacramento, Solano, eastern  Contra Costa, northeast Alameda, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, and  northwestern Madera Counties), southern San Joaquin Valley (portions of  Madera, central Fresno, and northern Tulare and Kings Counties), and  the Central Coast Range (southern Santa Cruz, Monterey, northern San  Luis Obispo, and portions of western San Benito, Fresno, and Kern  Counties) (Shaffer and Trenham 2002). Except for the Sonoma County and  Santa Barbara County populations, the geographic barriers between some  of these populations are not entirely clear. The Central California DPS  of the California tiger salamander (Central California tiger  salamander) occupies the Bay Area, Central Valley, southern San Joaquin  Valley, and the Central Coast Range.     Subadult and adult California tiger salamanders spend the dry  summer and fall months of the year estivating (existing in a state of  dormancy or inactivity in response to hot, dry weather) in the burrows  of small mammals, such as California ground squirrels (Spermophilus  beecheyi) and Botta's pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) (Storer 1925;  Loredo and Van Vuren 1996; Petranka 1998; Trenham 1998a). During  estivation, California tiger salamanders eat very little (Shaffer et  al. 1993). Once fall or winter rains begin, they emerge from the upland  sites on rainy nights to feed and to migrate to the breeding ponds  (Stebbins 1985, 1989; Shaffer et al. 1993).     California tiger salamanders spend the vast majority of their lives  in upland habitats, and cannot persist without it. The upland component  of California tiger salamander habitat typically consists of grassland  savannah with scattered oak trees. However, in Santa Barbara County,  some California tiger salamander breeding ponds exist within mixed  grassland and woodland habitats, and a few ponds are found in  woodlands, scrub, or chaparral habitats. Salamanders settle most  commonly in burrows in open grassland or under isolated oaks, and less  commonly in oak woodlands.  [[Page 28650]]      The salamanders breeding in, and living around, a seasonal pool or  pools, and associated uplands where estivation can occur, are said to  occupy a breeding site. A breeding site is defined as a location where  the animals are able to successfully breed in years of ``normal''  rainfall and complete their estivation. Historically, California tiger  salamanders utilized vernal pools, but the species will also breed in  stockponds.     Occurrence of California tiger salamanders is significantly  associated with occurrence of California ground squirrels (Seymour and  Westphal 1994). Active ground burrowing rodent colonies probably are  required to sustain California tiger salamanders because inactive  burrow systems become progressively unsuitable over time. Loredo et al.  (1996) found that California ground squirrel burrow systems collapsed  within 18 months following abandonment by, or loss of, the mammals.  Although California tiger salamanders use both occupied and unoccupied  burrows, they apparently do not use collapsed burrows.     Adult California tiger salamanders may migrate up to 1.6 km (1 mi)  from their upland sites to the breeding ponds (S. Sweet, University of  California, Santa Barbara, in litt. 1998), which may be vernal pools,  stockponds, or other seasonal water bodies. The distance between the  upland sites and breeding pools depends on local topography and  vegetation, and the distribution of California ground squirrel or other  rodent burrows (Stebbins 1989). Males migrate to the breeding ponds  before females (Twitty 1941; Shaffer, et al. 1993; Loredo and Van Vuren  1996; Trenham 1998b). Males usually remain in the ponds for an average  of about 6 to 8 weeks, while females stay for approximately 1 to 2  weeks. In dry years, both sexes may stay for shorter periods (Loredo  and Van Vuren 1996; Trenham 1998b). Most marked salamanders have been  recaptured at the pond where they were initially captured; in one  study, approximately 80 percent were recaptured at the same pond  (Trenham 1998b). The rate of natural movement of salamanders among  breeding sites depends on the distance between the ponds or complexes  of ponds and on the quality of intervening habitat (e.g., salamanders  may move more quickly through sparsely covered and open grassland than  they can through densely vegetated lands) (Trenham 1998a). As with  migration distances, the number of ponds used by an individual over its  lifetime depends on landscape features and environmental factors.     The adults mate in the ponds and the females lay their eggs in the  water (Twitty 1941; Shaffer et al. 1993; Petranka 1998). Females attach  their eggs singly or, in rare circumstances, in groups of two to four,  to twigs, grass stems, vegetation, or debris (Storer 1925; Twitty  1941). In ponds with no or limited vegetation, females may attach eggs  to objects, such as rocks and boards on the bottom (Jennings and Hayes  1994). After breeding, adults leave the pool and return to the small  mammal burrows (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a), although they may  continue to come out nightly for approximately the next 2 weeks to feed  (Shaffer et al. 1993). In drought years, the seasonal pools may not  form and the adults cannot breed (Barry and Shaffer 1994).     Salamander eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days with newly hatched  salamanders (larvae) ranging in size from 11.5 to 14.2 mm (0.45 to 0.55  in) in total length (Petranka 1998). The larvae are aquatic. Each is  yellowish gray in color and has a broad fat head, large, feathery  external gills, and broad dorsal fins that extend well onto its back.  The larvae feed on zooplankton, small crustaceans, and aquatic insects  for about 6 weeks after hatching, after which they switch to larger  prey (J. Anderson 1968). Larger larvae have been known to consume  smaller tadpoles of Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) and  California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) (J. Anderson 1968; P.  Anderson 1968). The larvae are among the top aquatic predators in the  seasonal pool ecosystems. They often rest on the bottom in shallow  water, but also may be found at different layers in the water column in  deeper water. The young salamanders are wary; when approached by  potential predators, they will dart into vegetation on the bottom of  the pool (Storer 1925).     The larval stage of the California tiger salamander usually lasts 3  to 6 months, because most seasonal ponds and pools dry up during the  summer (Petranka 1998). Amphibian larvae must grow to a critical  minimum body size before they can metamorphose (change into a different  physical form) to the terrestrial stage (Wilbur and Collins 1973).  Individuals collected near Stockton in the Central Valley during April  varied from 47 to 58 mm (1.85 to 2.3 in) in length (Storer 1925).  Feaver (1971) found that larvae metamorphosed and left the breeding  pools 60 to 94 days after the eggs had been laid, with larvae  developing faster in smaller, more rapidly drying pools. The longer the  ponding duration, the larger the larvae and metamorphosed juveniles are  able to grow, and the more likely they are to survive and reproduce  (Semlitsch et al. 1988; Pechmann et al. 1989; Morey 1998; Trenham  1998b). The larvae perish if a site dries before they complete  metamorphosis (P. Anderson 1968; Feaver 1971). Pechmann et al. (1989)  found a strong positive correlation between ponding duration and total  number of metamorphosing juveniles in 5 salamander species. In Madera  County, Feaver (1971) found that only 11 of 30 pools sampled supported  larval California tiger salamanders, and 5 of these dried before  metamorphosis could occur. Therefore, out of the original 30 pools,  only 6 (20 percent) provided suitable conditions for successful  reproduction that year. Size at metamorphosis is positively correlated  with stored body fat and survival of juvenile amphibians, and  negatively correlated with age at first reproduction (Semlitsch et al.  1988; Scott 1994; Morey 1998).     The metamorphosed juveniles leave their ponds in the late spring or  early summer. Before the pools dry completely, they settle in small  mammal burrows, to which they return at the end of nightly movements  (Zeiner et al. 1988; Shaffer et al. 1993; Loredo et al. 1996). Like the  adults, juveniles may emerge from these retreats to feed during nights  of high relative humidity (Storer 1925; Shaffer et al. 1993) before  settling in their selected upland sites for the dry, hot summer months.  Juveniles have been observed to migrate up to 1.6 km (1 mi) from  breeding pools to upland areas (Austin and Shaffer 1992).     An estimated 83 percent of the salamanders rely on rodent burrows  for shelter (Petranka 1998). Mortality of juveniles during their first  summer exceeds 50 percent (Trenham 1998b). Emergence from upland  estivation sites in hot, dry weather occasionally results in mass  mortality of juveniles (Holland et al. 1990). Juveniles do not  typically return to the breeding pools until they reach sexual  maturity, at several years of age (Trenham 1998b; Hunt 1998). Trenham  (1998b) estimated survival from metamorphosis to maturity at his study  site to be less than 5 percent (well below an estimated replacement  level of 18 percent). Adult survivorship varies greatly between years,  but is a crucial determinant of whether a population is a source or  sink (i.e., whether net productivity exceeds the level necessary to  maintain the population or it does not).     Lifetime reproductive success for California and other tiger  salamanders is low. Trenham et al. (2000) found the average female bred  1.4 times and produced 8.5 young that survived to metamorphosis per  reproductive effort. This resulted in roughly 11  [[Page 28651]]  metamorphic offspring over the lifetime of a female. Preliminary data  suggest that most California tiger salamander individuals require 2  years to become sexually mature. But some individuals may be slower to  mature (Shaffer et al. 1993), and some animals do not breed until they  are 4 to 6 years old. While individuals may survive for more than 10  years, many breed only once, and in some populations, less than 5  percent of marked juveniles survive to become breeding adults (Trenham  1998b). With such low recruitment, isolated populations can decline  greatly resulting from unusual, randomly occurring natural events, as  well as from human-caused factors that reduce breeding success and  individual survival. Factors that repeatedly lower breeding success in  isolated pools that are located too far from other pools to allow  migrating individuals to replenish the population can quickly extirpate  a population.     The life history and ecology of the California tiger salamander  make it likely that this population has a metapopulation structure  (Hanski and Gilpin 1991). A metapopulation is a set of local  populations or breeding sites within an area, where typically migration  from one local population or breeding site to other areas containing  suitable habitat is possible, but not routine. Dispersal (movement  between areas containing suitable habitat) is restricted by  inhospitable conditions around and between areas of suitable habitat.  Because many of the areas of suitable habitat may be small and support  small numbers of salamanders, local extinction may commonly occur. A  metapopulation's persistence depends on the combined dynamics of these  local extinctions and the subsequent recolonization of these areas  through dispersal (Hanski and Gilpin 1991; Hanski 1994; McCullough  1996).     The total number of individual California tiger salamanders is not  known. The difficulty of estimating total California tiger salamander  population size has been discussed by a number of biologists (Shaffer  et al. 1993; Jennings and Hayes 1994). However, estimates have been  made for a few populations in Monterey (Trenham et al. 2000; Barry and  Shaffer 1994). Because data on numbers of individual California tiger  salamanders are lacking, since they spend much of their lives  underground, and because only a portion of the total number of animals  migrate to pools to breed each year (Trenham et al. 2000), the  availability of suitable habitat and documentation of its loss may be  an appropriate method for assessing the status of the species.     Vernal pools and other seasonal ponds are the primary breeding  areas used by California tiger salamanders (Storer 1925; Feaver 1971;  Zeiner et al. 1988). The species occurs in 10 of the 17 Californian  vernal pool regions defined by Keeler-Wolf et al. (1998), including  northeastern Sacramento Valley, southeastern Sacramento Valley, Santa  Rosa, Solano-Colusa, Livermore, Central Coast, Carrizo, southern Sierra  Foothills, Santa Barbara, and San Joaquin Valley. Vernal pools  typically form in topographic depressions underlain by an impervious  layer (such as claypan, hardpan, or volcanic strata) that prevents  downward percolation of water. Vernal pool hydrology is characterized  by ponding of water during the late fall, winter, and spring, followed  by complete desiccation during the summer dry season (Holland and Jain  1998). Vernal pools support diverse flora and fauna that are adapted to  the dramatic seasonal changes in moisture and benefit from the lack of  predation by nonnative fish. Thirty other federally or State listed  species within the California tiger salamander's range are vernal pool  specialists, including 24 plants, 4 crustaceans, and 1 insect (Keeler- Wolf et al. 1998). California tiger salamanders, like the listed vernal  pool crustaceans, prefer seasonally ponded habitat. However, listed  vernal pool crustaceans require only a few weeks of inundation to  complete their life cycle (59 FR 48136; September 19, 1994); therefore,  pools that support crustacean populations may not hold water long  enough to allow successful metamorphosis of California tiger salamander  larvae.     In addition to vernal pools and seasonal ponds, California tiger  salamanders also use small artificial water bodies for breeding  (Stebbins 1985; Zeiner et al. 1988; Shaffer et al. 1993). Stockponds  for cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovies aries), horses (Equus caballus)  and other livestock have been, and continue to be, built to supply  local water needs, especially in rural grazing lands in coastal and  Sierra foothill areas where inexpensive public water or ground water is  not available (Bennett 1970). Stockponds, constructed as water sources  for livestock, are important habitats for the California tiger  salamander throughout its range (H. Shaffer, pers. comm. 2003; P.  Trenham, University of California, Davis, pers. comm. 2002). A large  population of the California tiger salamander coexists with sheep and  horses at the University of California Natural Reserve System's Jepson  Prairie in Solano County (P. Trenham, pers. comm. 2002; CNDDB 2002). In  some areas, stockponds have largely replaced vernal pools and provide  important habitat for the species. For instance, of the 112 California  tiger salamander locality records in the Livermore area where the  wetland type was identified, 88 percent (98 sites) are located in  stockponds (CNDDB 2002).     However, stockponds often are poorer habitat for California tiger  salamanders than natural vernal pools. Hydroperiods (amount of time the  stockpond contains water) may be so short that larvae cannot  metamorphose (e.g., when early drawdown of irrigation ponds occurs), or  so long that predatory fish and bullfrogs R. catesbeiana) can colonize  the pond (Shaffer et al. 1993; Seymour and Westphal 1994). Permanent  wetlands may occasionally support breeding California tiger salamanders  if fish are not present, but extirpation of the salamander population  is likely if fish are introduced (Shaffer et al. 1993; Seymour and  Westphal 1994). Artificial ponds also require ongoing maintenance and  are often temporary structures. Natural soil erosion, sometimes  increased by pond breaching, stock animal impacts, and off-road vehicle  (ORV) use, can cause ponds to silt in after a few decades (Hamilton and  Jepson 1940), thereby reducing their quality as salamander habitat.  Often ponds are not maintained because it may be more economical to  construct a new pond when the old pond fills with silt and is no longer  functional (Hamilton and Jepson 1940). Stockponds are often  geographically isolated from other seasonal wetlands occupied by  California tiger salamanders, and colonization of newly created ponds  beyond the normal dispersal range may be slow or nonexistent (Pechmann  et al. 1989).     Although stockponds can provide refugia for salamander populations  and are important for the species, these habitats may be dynamic.  Stockponds often dry out during drought, and flooding may destroy  downstream impoundments or cause siltation, either of which may result  in loss of aquatic habitat and extirpation of salamander populations.  Periodic maintenance to remove silt from stockponds may also cause a  temporary loss of habitat. Some eggs and larvae of the California tiger  salamander are probably trampled by livestock on the perimeters of the  stockponds. Populations of nonnative introduced predaceous fish and  bullfrogs, although less prevalent than in natural habitats, sometimes  become established in stockponds and have been implicated in the  decline of the  [[Page 28652]]  California tiger salamander (Fisher and Shaffer 1996).     Stockponds may also facilitate spread of nonnative organisms by  providing aquatic habitats in arid landscapes that otherwise may have  served as barriers to the spread of such organisms. Despite these  adverse impacts, the long-term effect of ranching on the species is  either neutral or beneficial, because the California tiger salamander  would have likely been extirpated from many areas if stockponds had not  been built and maintained for livestock production.  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment      Under the Act, we must consider for listing any species,  subspecies, or, for vertebrates, DPSs of these taxa, if information is  sufficient to indicate that such action may be warranted. To implement  the measures prescribed by the Act and its Congressional guidance, we,  along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  Fisheries, developed policy that addresses the recognition of DPSs for  potential listing actions (61 FR 4722; February 7, 1996). The policy  allows for a more refined application of the Act that better reflects  the biological needs of the taxon being considered, and avoids the  inclusion of entities that do not require its protective measures.  Under our DPS policy, we use two elements to assess whether a  population segment under consideration for listing may be recognized as  a DPS. The elements are: (1) the population segment's discreteness from  the remainder of the species to which it belongs; and (2) the  significance of the population segment to the species to which it  belongs. If we determine that a population segment being considered for  listing is a DPS, then we evaluate the level of threat to that  population segment on the basis of the five listing factors established  by the Act to determine if listing it as either threatened or  endangered is warranted.  Discreteness      The DPS policy's standard for discreteness is meant to allow an  entity given DPS status under the Act to be adequately defined and  described. A population segment of a vertebrate species may be  considered discrete if it satisfies either one of the following two  conditions: (1) it is markedly separated from other populations of the  same taxon as a consequence of physical, physiological, ecological, or  behavioral factors. Quantitative measures of genetic or morphological  discontinuity may provide evidence of this separation; or (2) it is  delimited by international governmental boundaries within which  significant differences in control of exploitation, management of  habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist.     Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer has analyzed the population genetics of the  California tiger salamander (Shaffer et al 1993; Shaffer and Trenham  2002). The most recently available and most comprehensive mtDNA  sequence data indicate that there are six populations of California  tiger salamander; these six populations are distinguished from one  another by their mtDNA characteristics (Shaffer and Trenham 2002). We  based our DPS determinations for the already-listed Sonoma County and  Santa Barbara County populations of the California tiger salamander in  part on the relatively high divergence of these populations from other  populations of California tiger salamanders (65 FR 57242; 68 FR 13498).  The phylogenetic tree (which indicates relationships among populations  or groups) constructed from the mtDNA data of Shaffer and Trenham  (2002) indicates that Sonoma County and Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamanders are very distinct relative to other California tiger  salamanders. They are separated from other California tiger salamanders  on branches that are statistically strongly supported. These data  indicate that Sonoma County and Santa Barbara County California tiger  salamanders are distinct from other populations of the species. The  genetic differentiation observed indicates that there has been little,  if any, gene flow for a significant period of time between the Sonoma  County population, the Santa Barbara County population, and the  remaining populations, which are the subject of this rulemaking  process.     Shaffer and Trenham's (2002) study may suggest that the Central  California tiger salamander consists of four populations, which are  found in the Bay Area, Central Valley, southern San Joaquin Valley, and  the Central Coast Range. Their genetic study suggests that levels of  interchange among these populations are low, and that populations or  groups of populations (metapopulations) are genetically different from  one another (Shaffer and Trenham 2002). However, the geographic  boundaries between some of these populations have not been fully  delineated (e.g., Bay Area and Central Coast Range populations in the  vicinity of the Contra Costa County/Alameda County lines, and the  border between the Central Coast Range/Central Valley populations).  Therefore, we believe it is not appropriate at this time to treat each  of these four populations as a separate DPS. Instead, we treat these  four populations as a single group, which is genetically and  geographically distinct from the Sonoma County and Santa Barbara County  groups.     The Central California tiger salamander is geographically isolated  and separate from the Sonoma County DPS and the Santa Barbara County  DPS, which are federally listed. The Sonoma County population is  separated geographically from the closest Central California tiger  salamander populations located in Contra Costa, Yolo, and Solano  Counties by the Coast Range, Napa River, and the Carquinez Straits, a  distance of about 72 km (45 mi). There are no known records of the  California tiger salamander in the intervening areas (D. Warenycia,  CDFG, pers. comm. 2002). The Santa Barbara County population is  geographically separated from the Central California tiger salamander  by the La Panza and Sierra Madre Ranges, and the Carrizo Plain, which  extends into the Tremblor Range in eastern San Luis Obispo and western  Kern Counties (Shaffer et al. 1993). Thus, the same conditions that  establish geographic isolation of the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander and the Sonoma County California tiger salamander from  the Central California tiger salamander work correlatively to establish  that the converse is also true. There is no evidence of natural  interchange of individuals between the Sonoma County and Santa Barbara  County populations with the Central California tiger salamander. The  genetic work discussed above (Shaffer and Trenham 2002) also indicates  that natural interchange is unlikely. Therefore, the best available  genetic data (Shaffer and Trenham 2002) for California tiger  salamanders indicate that the Central California tiger salamander is  distinct from the Sonoma County and Santa Barbara County DPSs.  Significance      Under our DPS policy, once we have determined that a population  segment is discrete, we consider its biological and ecological  significance to the larger taxon to which it belongs. This  consideration may include, but is not limited to, evidence of the  persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting  that is unique for the taxon; evidence that loss of the population  segment would result in a significant gap in the range of the species;  evidence that the population segment represents the only surviving  natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an  introduced population outside its historic range; and evidence that the  [[Page 28653]]  discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of  the species in its genetic characteristics. We have found substantial  evidence that two of these significance factors are met by the  population of the Central California tiger salamander.     The extinction of the Central California tiger salamander would  likely result in the loss of a significant genetic entity and create a  significant gap in the range of the species. Shaffer and Trenham's  recent genetic work (2002) indicates that the Central California tiger  salamander consists of four populations. As discussed above, the  Central California tiger salamander differs genetically from the Sonoma  County and Santa Barbara DPSs. This supports the hypothesis that no  natural interchange of the Central California tiger salamander occurs  with the Santa Barbara County or the Sonoma County DPSs. Loss of the  Central California tiger salamander would also result in a significant  gap in the range of the species.  Conclusion      We evaluated the Central California tiger salamander, addressing  the two elements which our policy requires us to consider in deciding  whether a vertebrate population may be recognized as a DPS and  considered for listing under the Act. We propose that the Central  California tiger salamander is discrete, as per our policy, because it  is both genetically different and geographically separated from the  Santa Barbara County and Sonoma County DPSs. We propose that the  Central California tiger salamander is significant because the loss of  species would result in a significant gap in the range. It would also  constitute loss of a genetically divergent portion of the species.  Because the population segment appears to meet both the discreteness  and significance criteria of our DPS policy, we propose that the  Central California tiger salamander constitutes a DPS that qualifies  for consideration for listing.     We have already listed the Sonoma County DPS and Santa Barbara  County DPS as endangered. We will be reviewing the relationship between  the Central California tiger salamander, and the Sonoma County and  Santa Barbara County DPSs as part of this proposed rulemaking.  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      Section 4 of the Act, and the regulations (50 CFR part 424)  promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act, describe  the procedures for adding species to the Federal list of Endangered and  Threatened Wildlife and Plants. We may determine a species to be  endangered or threatened on the basis of one or more of the five  factors described in section 4(a)(1) of the Act. These factors, and  their application to the Central California tiger salamander, are  described below.     We have analyzed threats to the California tiger salamander  throughout the four populations using information from 608 California  tiger salamander sites identified in the CNDDB, of which 486 sites are  known to be extant (Service 2003). This database includes the  localities listed by Shaffer et al. (1993), Seymour and Westphal  (1994), LSA Associates, Inc. (1994), and numerous other biologists. At  each of these localities, at least one California tiger salamander  (adult, juvenile or larva) has been identified by a biologist. Upland  habitat types in the vicinity of these localities include annual  grassland (49 percent) and oak savannah (12 percent) (California GAP  1996; Service 2003). The remaining upland habitat types are  agricultural crops, urban areas, and other natural habitats. The  localities in the CNDDB for which one or more wetland type was  identified included vernal pools, artificial bermed ponds or  stockponds, or ponds. Threats are analyzed in detail below in the  discussion of the five factors affecting the species.  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of Its Habitat or Range      Destruction, modification, and curtailment of Central California  tiger salamander habitat is caused by a variety of urban and  agricultural land uses. We define urban impacts to include a variety of  nonagricultural development activities, such as building and  maintenance of housing, commercial, and industrial developments;  construction and widening of roads and highways; golf course  construction and maintenance; trash dumping, landfill operation and  expansion; operation of gravel mines and quarries; dam building; and  inundation of habitat by reservoirs. Agricultural impacts include the  conversion of native habitat by discing and deep-ripping; and  cultivation, planting, and maintenance of row crops, orchards, and  vineyards.     Many habitat changes began before California tiger salamanders were  widely collected or studied by biologists. Habitat degradation or loss,  alteration of vernal pools and seasonal ponds, introduction of  nonnative organisms, and other changes have occurred throughout the  range of this species (Shaffer et al. 1993; Jennings and Hayes 1994;  Thelander 1994).     These impacts threaten both wetland breeding habitat and upland  habitat. Even salamanders utilizing breeding sites that are protected  from development may not persist as viable populations if upland sites  are unavailable. Earthmoving operations and cultivation in upland  habitat can directly or indirectly kill or injure California tiger  salamanders in burrows or on the surface by crushing or trapping them.  These practices can also expose salamanders to adverse environmental  conditions (increased predation, high temperatures, low humidity) and  alter surface hydrology (potentially affecting breeding ponds).  Discing, deep-ripping, or grading of upland habitat also destroys  California ground squirrel burrows and other crevices, making suitable  upland sites unavailable and reducing long-term adult survival of  Central California tiger salamanders. Ongoing agricultural and urban  land uses prevent upland sites from being reestablished, and may kill  or injure salamanders that enter the developed area. Existing vineyards  and orchards can disrupt annual migration patterns and cut off access  to breeding wetlands as salamanders avoid moving through areas with  heavy canopy cover (S. Sweet, in litt. 1998). Agricultural and urban  land uses can interfere with dispersal among breeding sites and prevent  natural recolonization of ponds after local extirpation.     Filling, discing, or excavating wetland habitat can directly kill  or injure larvae, eggs, or breeding adults, and prevents future use of  the wetland for reproduction. Additionally, surviving adults may be  unable to locate alternative breeding sites in subsequent years.  Erosion from agriculture or grading can similarly impair reproductive  success by causing sedimentation and degradation of nearby wetlands (S.  Sweet, in litt. 1998; Sneed 2000). Changes in flooding duration and  depth caused by urban and agricultural land use (e.g., digging of  drainage/irrigation ditches, construction of permanent ponds or  reservoirs, deepening or berming of seasonal wetlands, redirection of  runoff from developments) can reduce reproductive success either by  prematurely drying wetlands and desiccating larvae, or by extending the  flooded period and facilitating invasion of exotic predators (see  Factor C). Other secondary effects of agricultural and urban land uses  include increased road mortality, drift and runoff of pesticides and  fertilizers,  [[Page 28654]]  and ongoing rodent-control activities (see Factor E).     A comparison of the past and present extent of suitable habitat for  the Central California tiger salamander indicates that the range of the  species has been substantially reduced from its historical  distribution. Historically, approximately 3.67 million hectares (ha)  (9.06 million acres (ac)) of valley and coastal grasslands existed  within the range of the Central California tiger salamander, with an  additional 2.64 million ha (6.53 million ac) supporting an overstory of  blue oak/foothill pine, valley oak, or mixed hardwoods (Kuchler 1988),  for a total of 6.31 million ha (15.59 million ac) of potential habitat.  However, urbanization and intensive agriculture have eliminated  virtually all valley grassland and oak savanna habitat from the Central  Valley floor. Valley grasslands and, consequently, Central California  tiger salamanders are now distributed primarily in a ring around the  Central Valley (Heady 1977). An analysis of CNNDB (2002) and Service  (2003) records indicate that currently there are only about 4.5 million  ha (11.1 million ac) of potential habitat where the California tiger  salamander may still be extant. From 1995 to 2020, the human population  in the range of the Central California tiger salamander (Central  Valley, Bay Area, and Central Coast Counties) is projected to grow by  49 percent (from 12.8 million to 19.1 million people) (California  Department of Water Resources (CDWR) 1998). Therefore, impacts on the  Central California tiger salamander and conversion of its habitat  resulting from urban development are expected to continue.     The relative loss of habitat has been even more extreme with  respect to vernal pools, the historic breeding habitat of the Central  California tiger salamander. Approximately 1.68 million ha (4.15  million ac) of grasslands in 20 Central Valley Counties are estimated  to have supported vernal pools at the time of European settlement  (Holland 1978, 1998a, 1998b; Holland and Jain 1988). Most of this area,  excepting the northern Sacramento Valley, was within the Central  California tiger salamander's historical range. The remaining vernal  pool complexes are now fragmented and reduced in area. Where vernal  pools remain, they are often disturbed and degraded by drainage  modification, overgrazing, ORV use, nonnative plant invasion, trash  dumping, road construction, and urban development (Jones and Stokes  Associates 1987; 59 FR 48136; Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). Vernal pools  are now recognized as a threatened resource (Jones and Stokes  Associates 1987; Wright 1991; 59 FR 48136). During the 1980s and 1990s,  vernal pool grasslands continued to be lost at an estimated rate of 1.5  percent per year (Holland 1998a, 1998b). As of 1997, 377,165 ha  (931,991 ac) of vernal pool grasslands remained in the Central Valley,  representing a loss of approximately 78 percent (Holland 1998a, 1998b).  Along the southeastern edge of the Central Valley, from San Joaquin to  Fresno Counties, at least 25 percent of the 259-ha (640-ac) sections  that had contained vernal pools in 1970 (Holland 1978) were wholly  converted to agriculture or urban uses by 1994 (Seymour and Westphal  1994). This conversion estimate is probably conservative because it  does not include partially converted sections where vernal pool habitat  may also have been lost (Seymour and Westphal 1994).     Shaffer et al. (1993) detected California tiger salamanders in only  36 of 86 localities (42 percent) that had been previously recorded, and  ponds currently occupied by California tiger salamanders were  significantly higher in elevation than those that were unoccupied or  had been previously occupied. These data suggest that low-elevation  breeding sites on the valley floor have been eliminated in recent  years, thereby restricting the species to higher-elevation habitats on  the margin of its ecological requirements (Shaffer et al. 1993; Seymour  and Westphal 1994; Fisher and Shaffer 1996).     In both our final rule listing the Santa Barbara County DPS of the  California tiger salamander (65 FR 57242), and the Sonoma County DPS of  the California tiger salamander (67 FR 47726), we described land  conversions to more intensive agriculture, especially conversions to  grape vineyards, as being a factor in the species' decline. Data from  the California Agricultural Statistics Service (CASS) (2002) provides  further corroboration that this is a factor and shows that the  phenomenon extends over much of the Central California tiger  salamander's current and historic range.     Urban development poses a similar significant threat to the Central  California tiger salamander. The human population of the State of  California is continuing to increase, along with a concomitant increase  in urban development. According to the 2000 census, the number of  people in California has increased by 13.8 percent since 1990  (California Department of Finance 2002). The average growth in human  population within the Counties in the range of the Central California  tiger salamander has been 19.5 percent. Counties in the East Bay region  and the Highway 99 corridor in the San Joaquin Valley are undergoing  increases both in human population and related urbanization. Sub- populations at forty-one records of the Central California tiger  salamander from the CNDDB data base have been extirpated by urban  development (Service 2003).     The information documenting the present or threatened destruction,  modification, or curtailment of Central California tiger salamander  habitat or range due to urbanization and other factors is organized  below as it applies to four populations of the species (Shaffer et al.  1993; Shaffer and Trenham 2002) that we have not yet listed.     Bay Area Population (Alameda, Santa Clara, San Benito, southwestern  San Joaquin, western Stanislaus, and western Merced Counties): Thirty- two percent (194 of 608 sites) of the known California tiger salamander  records are in this population, most of them in eastern Alameda and  Santa Clara Counties (CNDDB 2002). Forty-nine of these records in the  Bay Area population are considered extirpated due to urbanization,  orchards and vineyards, and hybridization with nonnative tiger  salamanders (CNDDB 2002; Service 2003). There are 83,386 ha (206,051  ac) of potential habitat for the California tiger salamander in the Bay  Area (Service 2003).     The East Bay area of the Bay Area and Livermore Valley area has  undergone intensive urban development in recent years. The total human  population of Santa Clara, Contra Costa, Alameda, Solano, and Yolo  Counties increased by approximately 86 percent between 1990 and 2002.  From 1995 to 2020, the human population is projected to increase by 18  percent for the San Francisco Bay hydrologic region, with agricultural  crop land use projected to remain around 26,305 ha (65,000 ac) (CDWR  1998). From 1990 to 1996, 16,457 ha (40,665 ac) of native habitat were  converted to urban and agricultural uses in Santa Clara, Alameda, and  San Benito Counties (California Department of Conservation (CDC) 1994,  1998). Approximately 90 percent of land conversions in Santa Clara,  Alameda, and Contra Costa Counties were to urban use.     Of 98 California tiger salamander localities where wetland type was  identified, only 15 percent (15) were located in vernal pools. These  wetland type localities within the Bay Area population of California  tiger salamanders occur within the Solano-Colusa and Livermore vernal  pool regions (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). However, little vernal pool  habitat  [[Page 28655]]  remains within these regions. Many of the Solano-Colusa vernal pools  have been destroyed or degraded by agricultural conversion, water  impounding for waterfowl habitat enhancement, urban development, and  road-building. Most of the vernal pools in the Livermore Region have  been destroyed or degraded by urban development, agriculture, water  diversions, poor water quality, and long-term overgrazing (Keeler-Wolf  et al. 1998). Many breeding sites in the Bay Area population are in  artificial water bodies rather than natural vernal pools. Overall, 43  percent (83) of the records are in stock, farm, or berm ponds used for  cattle grazing and as a temporary source of water for small farm  irrigation (CNDDB 2002).     California tiger salamander localities in Contra Costa and Alameda  Counties may be affected by ORV use; at least 10 proposed housing  developments; 3 golf courses; infrastructure construction, including  expansion of an airport, a landfill, and a power station; and highway  construction (CNDDB 2002). These development projects may destroy  upland habitat and wetland breeding habitat, killing salamanders and  reducing the viability of populations at the affected localities.     In eastern Contra Costa and Alameda Counties, especially the  Livermore and Amador Valleys, urban expansion continues at a rapid  pace. California tiger salamander populations in the Livermore Valley  are severely threatened by the ongoing conversion of 14,527 ha (35,897  ac) of grazing land to subdivisions and vineyards (Stebbins 1989; East  Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) 1999). Almost the entire valley  floor, and large portions of the adjacent hills, are being developed or  are being considered for development and eventual annexation. The North  Livermore and South Livermore Valley Specific Plans represent 11,727 ha  (28,977 ac) of planned urban development in and around Livermore Valley  (EBRPD 1999). Urban Growth Boundaries encompass 108,262 ha (267,520  ac), including the Livermore, La Costa, Amador, Sunol, and Vallecitos  valleys in east Alameda County and the Clayton, Lone Tree, Deer, and  Briones valleys of eastern Contra Costa County (Alameda County Planning  Department 1993; EBRPD 1999). These valleys constitute much of the core  area inhabited by the Bay Area California tiger salamander population.  Shaffer et al. (1993) found that the East Bay Counties of Alameda and  Contra Costa supported the greatest concentrations of California tiger  salamander. Three localities are known from near San Francisco Bay in  southwestern Alameda County, and are partially protected by San  Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.     California tiger salamanders at a university in Palo Alto declined  to near extirpation due, in part, to urban development of adjoining  upland areas (Barry and Shaffer 1994), but water management and other  take-reduction efforts have been implemented in recent years to protect  the population (Thomas Reid Associates 1998). A locality within the  City of San Jose is threatened by urban development. Several areas in  southern Santa Clara County also are undergoing urban expansion.     Central Valley Population (Yolo, Solano, Sacramento County south of  the Cosumnes River, northeastern Contra Costa, eastern San Joaquin,  western Amador, western Calaveras, western Tuolumne, eastern  Stanislaus, Merced, western Mariposa, and northwestern Madera  Counties): Forty-seven percent (286 of the 608 sites) of the known  California tiger salamander records are in this population (CNDDB  2002). Subpopulations at 37 of recorded locations in the Central Valley  Population are considered extirpated (CNDDB 2002; Service 2003). Urban  development and agriculture have eliminated much of the grassland and  vernal pools. From 1996 to 1998, 14,361 ha (35,487 ac) of native  habitat were converted to urban and agricultural uses in Yolo, Solano,  Contra Costa, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Madera  Counties (CDC 2000). There are 146,600 ha (362,253 ac) of potential  habitat for the California tiger salamander in the Central Valley  (Service 2003). The species historically occurred as far north as Butte  County but has not recently been documented north of the Cosumnes  River. The remaining sites inhabited by the California tiger salamander  occur in the low-elevation foothills on the eastern side of the Central  Valley (Shaffer et al. 1993).     Of 127 California tiger salamander localities where wetland type  was identified, 26 percent (33) were in vernal pools. These wetland  type localities within the Central Valley population of California  tiger salamanders occurs within the southeastern Sacramento Valley and  southern Sierra foothills vernal pool regions (Keeler-Wolf et al.  1998). Vernal pools in both regions are threatened by conversion of  grasslands and grazing land to housing developments and intensive  agriculture (see Factor E).     California tiger salamander localities in the Central Valley  population may be affected by recently implemented development  projects, including vineyards and proposed highway construction. These  development projects may destroy upland habitat and wetland breeding  habitat, killing salamanders and reducing the viability of populations  at the affected localities. Large vineyards planted in areas along the  San Joaquin-Sacramento County line have degraded and destroyed habitat  for California tiger salamanders.     In Yolo and Solano Counties, the major impacts to California tiger  salamander populations have been agricultural. Portions of the  California tiger salamander locality at Jepson Prairie in Solano County  is protected by the University of California Natural Reserve System and  the Solano Land Trust. However, some upland habitat may have been  disrupted by construction of a natural gas pipeline in the vicinity.  California tiger salamanders also were found at some proposed power  plant sites near Jepson Prairie.     In Stanislaus County, California tiger salamanders were considered  extirpated until they recently were found by biologists surveying a  potential route for a highway bypass near Oakdale (California  Department of Transportation 2000). This highway route threatens the  only known population of California tiger salamanders in the Oakdale  area. However, other populations are known to exist within Stanislaus  County outside the Oakdale area.     South San Joaquin Population: (western Madera, central Fresno, and  northwestern Tulare Counties north of the St. Johns and Kaweah Rivers):  Nine percent (56 of the 608 sites) of the known California tiger  salamander sites are in this population (CNDDB 2002). However, 18 of  these sites in the South San Joaquin population are considered  extirpated (CNDDB 2002; Service 2003). From 1996 to 1998, 4,509 ha  (11,142 ac) of native habitat were converted to urban and agricultural  uses in Fresno, Tulare, and Madera Counties (CDC 2000). There are  24,450 ha (60,418 ac) of potential habitat for the California tiger  salamander in the southern San Joaquin Valley (Service 2003).     Ninety-seven percent (31) of 32 localities for which wetland type  was identified in the South San Joaquin population are within vernal  pools. These wetland type localities within the South San Joaquin  population of the California tiger salamander occur within the southern  Sierra Foothill Vernal Pool Region (Keeler-Wolf 1998). Although we are  unaware of a specific quantified estimate of loss for this vernal pool  region, we believe that a significant  [[Page 28656]]  number of vernal pools in this region have been destroyed, fragmented,  and degraded by conversion to intensive agriculture and housing  developments.     Shaffer et al. (1993) were unable to find breeding habitat to  sample for presence of the California tiger salamander over most of the  original grassland habitat of the San Joaquin Valley. Where ponds were  located, California tiger salamanders generally were absent (72 percent  of 324 ponds sampled were absent). The rarity of this species in the  San Joaquin Valley, in habitat that was apparently suitable  historically, suggests widespread extirpation of California tiger  salamanders from habitat conversion to agricultural and urban uses  (Stebbins 1989). Large areas of California tiger salamander habitat  were destroyed and degraded by major urbanization in this region during  the 1970s and 1980s (Shaffer et al. 1993). Agricultural, housing, road,  and commercial developments on the valley floor of Fresno, Madera, and  Tulare Counties have reduced suitable habitat to a fraction of the  species' historical range (J. Halstead, Kings River Conservation  District, in litt. 1994). Most remaining salamander habitat on the  eastern side of the Central Valley occurs on tracts of privately-owned  ranch land (Seymour and Westphal 1994).     California tiger salamander localities in the South San Joaquin  population may be affected by proposed development projects, including  housing developments and highway construction. These development  projects would likely destroy upland habitat and wetland breeding  habitat, likely killing salamanders and reducing the viability of  populations at the affected localities.     Several large water storage and delivery projects have been  constructed in the South San Joaquin population. These projects have  flooded large areas of known and potential salamander habitat.  Additional habitat has been lost to construction from associated State  and County park recreational facilities (e.g., boat ramps, campgrounds,  parking lots) and agriculture and urbanization facilitated by water  supply development.     Numerous new housing developments and golf courses are planned or  in progress around Millerton Lake in Fresno and Madera Counties (J.  Halstead, in litt. 1994; The Keith Companies 1994). Extensive areas of  upland habitat and wetland breeding habitat will likely be destroyed by  these developments, potentially killing many salamanders and/or further  reducing the viability of any remaining habitat at these localities.     California tiger salamanders are known from eight localities in  Tulare County, most of which are surrounded by a matrix of agricultural  lands.     Central Coast Population (southern Santa Cruz, Monterey, extreme  western San Benito, extreme western Fresno, extreme western Kings,  extreme northwestern Kern, and San Luis Obispo Counties): Twelve  percent (72 of the 608 localities) of the known California tiger  salamander records are in the Central Coast Range population. Nineteen  of these sites in the Central Coast population are considered  extirpated (CNDDB 2002; Service 2003). From 1996 to 1998, 2,084 ha  (5,149 ac) of native habitat were converted to urban and agricultural  uses in San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties (CDC 2000). There are  28,411 ha (70,205 ac) of potential habitat for the California tiger  salamander in the Central Coast.     California tiger salamanders in this population occurred  predominantly in stock ponds, reservoirs, seasonal lakes, and  intermittent streams. Of the California tiger salamander localities in  this population where the wetland type was identified, 26 percent (86)  were vernal pools. The wetland type localities within the Central Coast  Range population of the California tiger salamander occur in the  Central Coast and San Joaquin Valley Vernal Pool Regions (Keeler-Wolf  et al. 1998). The annual loss of vernal pools from 1994 to 2000 in  Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura  Counties appears to be accelerating to a rate of 2 to 3 percent  annually (Holland 2003).     Two California tiger salamander localities occur at a 8,064 ha  (19,927 ac) development project site that comprises 14 percent of the  Greater Monterey Peninsula Planning Area, which is nearly half of the  Planning Area's unimproved land. Construction on this project has been  initiated (D. Steeck, Service, pers. comm. 2000). Eleven localities  occur on Fort Ord, an 11,220 ha (27,726 ac) former military  installation that has been transferred to the U.S. Bureau of Land  Management (BLM), California Department of Parks and Recreation,  California State University, Santa Cruz, and Monterey County  municipalities. The proposed habitat management plan (Jones and Stokes  Associates 1993) for Fort Ord includes protection of salamander  breeding habitat at seven of these localities within the designated  Natural Resource Management Area (NRMA) managed by BLM. Two of the  localities in the NRMA are within a highway easement, and may be  imperiled due to future road construction. The protected area has  historically been extensively used by ORVs, but recent enforcement of  ORV restrictions by BLM has apparently reduced this problem (R. Lewis,  BLM, pers. comm. 1999). Excavation for removal of unexploded ordnance  could potentially disrupt breeding or upland habitat in the NRMA (Jones  and Stokes Associates 1993), but ordnance removal in breeding ponds has  not yet been deemed necessary (D. Steeck, pers. comm. 2000). The  remaining four localities on Fort Ord are projected for development as  recreational areas, commercial centers, and a university campus.  Development in these areas may avoid breeding ponds, but additional  upland habitat is likely to be lost and fragmented.  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      There is no evidence that overutilization is a factor causing  decline of the California tiger salamander.  C. Disease or Predation  Disease     Relatively little is known about the diseases of wild amphibians  (Alford and Richards 1999). The specific effects of disease on the  Central California tiger salamander are not known and the risks to the  animal have not been determined.     Pathogen outbreaks have not been documented in the Central  California tiger salamander. Nevertheless, disease must be considered a  potential future population threat because of the relatively small,  fragmented remaining Central California tiger salamander breeding  sites, the many stresses on these sites due to habitat losses and  alterations, and the many other potential disease-enhancing  anthropogenic changes which have occurred both inside and outside the  species' range. Predation     A number of nonnative California species have likely adversely  affected the Central California tiger salamander in many parts of its  range through predation and competition. Bullfrogs prey on California  tiger salamanders (P. Anderson 1968; Lawler et al. 1999). The bullfrog,  native to the United States east of the Great Plains, was introduced  into California in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and it rapidly  spread throughout the State (Storer 1925 as cited in Moyle 1973; Hayes  and Jennings 1986). Morey and Guinn (1992) documented a shift in  [[Page 28657]]  amphibian community composition at a vernal pool complex, with  salamanders becoming proportionally less abundant as bullfrogs  increased in number. Although bullfrogs are unable to establish  permanent breeding populations in unaltered vernal pools and seasonal  ponds because they require more than 1 year to complete their larval  stage, dispersing immature bullfrogs take up residence in such water  bodies during winter and spring where they prey on native amphibians,  including larval salamanders (Morey and Guinn 1992; Seymour and  Westphal 1994). A strong negative correlation exists between bullfrog  presence and California tiger salamander presence (Shaffer et al. 1993;  Seymour and Westphal 1994).     Because bullfrogs are known to travel at least 2.6 km (1.6 mi) from  one pond to another (Bury and Whelan 1984), they have the potential to  naturally colonize new areas where they do not currently exist,  including where Central California tiger salamanders occur. In one  study of the eastern San Joaquin Valley, it was found that 22 of 23  ponds (96 percent) with California tiger salamanders were within the  bullfrogs' potential dispersal range (Seymour and Westphal 1994). In  addition, because bullfrogs are still sought within California for  sport and as food, and may be taken without limit under a fishing  license, the threat of transport for intentional establishment in new  habitat suitable for the Central California tiger salamanders is  significant.     Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) are native to central North  America (watersheds tributary to the Gulf of Mexico) and have been  introduced throughout the world for mosquito control, including  California, beginning in 1922. Western mosquitofish now occur  throughout California wherever the water does not get too cold for  extended periods, and they are still widely planted throughout the  State (K. Boyce, Sacramento County/Yolo County Mosquito and Vector  Control District, in litt. 1994; Moyle 2002) by about 50 local mosquito  abatement districts. Western mosquitofish are ubiquitous because of  their tolerance of poor water quality and wide temperature ranges (K.  Boyce, in litt. 1994).     Salamanders may be especially vulnerable to western mosquitofish  predation due to their fluttering external gills, which may attract  these visual predators (Graf and Allen-Diaz 1993). Loredo-Prendeville  et al. (1994) found no California tiger salamanders inhabiting ponds  containing western mosquitofish. Leyse and Lawler (2000) found that the  survival of California tiger salamander in experimental ponds stocked  with western mosquitofish, at densities similar to those found in many  stock ponds, was significantly reduced. Larvae that survived in ponds  with western mosquitofish were smaller, took longer to reach  metamorphosis, and had injuries such as shortened tails.     Western mosquitofish prey on other amphibian species, such as  California newt (Taricha torosa) (Gamradt and Kats 1996) and Pacific  treefrog (Goodsell and Kats 1999) tadpoles in both field and laboratory  experiments, even when given the optional prey of mosquito larvae  (Goodsell and Kats 1999; L. Kats, Pepperdine University, pers. comm.  1999). Western mosquitofish have also been observed ingesting and then  spitting out California newt larvae, causing severe damage to the newts  in the process (Graf and Allen-Diaz 1993). Given the effects of western  mosquito fish on other amphibian species, they are likely to have  similar effects on Central California tiger salamanders. If they have  the same effects, the use of western mosquito fish in Central  California tiger salamander habitat threatens its persistence.     Other nonnative fish have either been directly implicated in  predation of California tiger salamanders or appear to have the  potential to prey upon them. For example, introductions of sunfish  species (e.g., largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill  (Lepomis macrochirus), catfish (Ictalurus spp.), and fathead minnows  (Pimephales promelas) are believed to have eliminated Central  California tiger salamanders from several breeding sites in Santa  Barbara County (65 FR 3096). Nonnative sunfish species, catfish, and  bullheads (Ameiurus spp.) have been, and still are, widely planted in  ponds in California to provide for sportfishing. By 1984, the  California fish fauna included about 50 such transplanted and exotic  species, mostly from eastern North American origin (Hayes and Jennings  1986). More recently, Moyle (2002) estimated that, on average,  California is losing about one native species or subspecies of fish  every 5 to 6 years, and gaining an average of one alien species about  every 2 years.     Nonnative fish introductions may be responsible for the declines of  frog species in western North America (Hayes and Jennings 1986). Such  introduced fish may be a problem for California ranids because of their  specialization for preying on aquatic life (including eggs and larvae),  and because the affected amphibians may have evolved under conditions  of limited fish predation, which now increases the impacts of the  introductions (Hayes and Jennings 1986). We believe the same threat may  apply to the Central California tiger salamander. Thus, we consider  introductions of such nonnative fish species into Central California  tiger salamander breeding habitat a potential threat to the persistence  of the species.     The range and breeding habitats of the Central California tiger  salamander also overlap with the ranges and habitats of several  nonnative and native crayfish (Pacifastacus, Orconectes, and  Procambarus spp.). Crayfish prey on California tiger salamanders  (Shaffer et al. 1993) and are thought to have eliminated some  populations (Jennings and Hayes 1994). In Sonoma County, a nonnative  crayfish has been found throughout ditches within California tiger  salamander range, but not in any nearby pools known to support  California tiger salamander breeding (D. Cook, The Wildlife Society,  pers. comm. 2002). Crayfish are also known to prey on California newt  eggs and larvae, despite toxins produced by these amphibians, and  crayfish may be a significant factor in the loss of newts from several  streams in southern California (Gamradt and Kats 1996). Thus, based on  direct and indirect evidence, we believe that crayfish, especially  several nonnative species, represent a considerable threat to the  persistence of the Central California tiger salamander.     Another nonnative species which may represent a threat to the  species, is the wild pig (Sus scrofa). The wild pig population in  California, which was recently estimated at about 106,000 to 160,000  individuals (Waithman et al. 1999), resulted from numerous  introductions, both from domesticated pigs escaping captivity, and more  recently from deliberate introductions for sport-hunting, over the last  two centuries. Although range expansion of introduced wild pigs has  ceased in many regions of the United States, it increased significantly  since the 1950s in California (Waithman et al. 1999). Wild pigs are now  distributed within parts of 49 of California's 58 Counties (Waithman et  al. 1999), with densities as high as 3.8 (Sweitzer et al. 2000) to 4.7  pigs per square kilometer (9.8 to12.2 pigs per square mile) (Schauss et  al. 1990).     Wild pigs have been widely implicated in declines and extinctions   of numerous species worldwide, and have had pronounced negative  ecological effects on Central California tiger salamanders when their  populations are high (Waithman et al.  [[Page 28658]]  1999). Detrimental effects of wild pigs on the Central California tiger  salamander include both predation and habitat modifications. One  recognized expert on wild pigs in California states that he has found  bullfrogs, snakes, and newts in pig stomachs, and he believes that  California tiger salamanders would be consumed by pigs, if encountered  (R. Barrett, University of California, Berkeley, pers. comm. 2002), a  view also shared by another wild pig expert in Florida (R. Belden,  Florida Wildlife Commission, pers. comm. 2002). The nocturnal behavior  of wild pigs, and their affinity for ponds and watering holes in oak  woodlands of foothills and other fringe areas of the Central California  tiger salamander's range, coupled with the nocturnal movements of  Central California tiger salamanders during the rainy season, could  result in considerable predation. In addition, wild pigs may cause  ecological damage to Central California tiger salamander habitat,  including consumption of vegetation for food, and rooting and digging,  which may change plant successional patterns, soil properties, water  infiltration rates, water quality (Synatzske 1993), or the small-mammal  burrows the salamander needs during estivation.     California tiger salamanders are also likely preyed on by many  species of native fish and wildlife. In healthy salamander populations,  such predation should not be a significant threat. But when combined  with other impacts, such as predation by nonnative species,  contaminants, migration barriers, or habitat alteration, it may cause a  significant decrease in population viability. Native predators  including avian species, such as great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and  snowy egrets (Egretta thula), western pond turtles (Clemmys marmorata),  various garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.), larger California tiger  salamanders, larger spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus hammondii), and  California red-legged frogs (Peters 1993; Hansen and Tremper 1993). In  Arizona, larval tiger salamanders are preyed upon by adult predaceous  diving beetles (Dytiscus dauricus) (Holomuzki 1986); turkey vultures  (Carthartes aura) have been observed feeding on larval or adult tiger  salamanders (Duncan 1999).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The primary cause of Central California tiger salamander decline is  the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of habitat due to human  activities. Federal, State, and local laws have been insufficient to  prevent past and ongoing losses of the limited habitat of the Central  California tiger salamander, and are unlikely to prevent further  declines of the species. Federal     Clean Water Act. Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (33  U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)  regulates the discharge of fill material into waters of the United  States, including wetlands. Section 404 regulations require applicants  to obtain a permit for projects that involve the discharge of fill  material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. However,  normal farming activities are exempt under the CWA and do not require a  permit (53 FR 20764; Robert Wayland III, Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), in litt. 1996). Projects that are subject to regulation  may qualify for authorization to place fill material into waters of the  United States, including wetlands, under several nationwide permits.  The use of nationwide permits by an applicant or project proponent is  normally authorized with minimal environmental review by the Corps. No  activity that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a  threatened or endangered species, or that is likely to destroy or  adversely modify designated critical habitat of such species, is  authorized under any nationwide permit. An individual permit may be  required by the Corps if a project otherwise qualifying under a  nationwide permit would have greater than minimal adverse environmental  impacts.     Recent court cases may further limit the Corps' ability to utilize  the CWA to regulate the discharge of fill or dredged material into the  aquatic environment within the current range of the California tiger  salamander (Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001) (SWANCC)). The effect of SWANCC  on Federal regulation of activities in wetlands in the area of the  Central California tiger salamander has recently become clear by the  Corps' decision not to assert its jurisdiction over the discharge of  fill material into several wetlands within the range of the Central  California tiger salamander. In a letter from the Corps, dated March 8,  2002, concerning the discharge of fill into 0.18 ha (0.45 ac) of  seasonal wetlands southwest of the intersection of Piner and Marlow  Roads (Corps File Number 19736N), the Corps referenced the SWANCC  decision and reiterated that the subject wetlands were not ``waters of  the United States'' because they were: (1) Not navigable waters; (2)  not interstate waters; (3) not part of a tributary system to 1 or 2;  (4) not wetlands adjacent to any of the foregoing; and (5) not an  impoundment of any of the above. The letter further stated that the  interstate commerce nexus to these particular waters is insufficient to  establish CWA jurisdiction, and therefore, not subject to regulation by  the Corps under Section 404 of the CWA. The Corps also cited the SWANCC  decision as their reasoning for not taking jurisdiction over fill of  Sonoma County California tiger salamander breeding pools at the  recently constructed South Sonoma Business Park (Corps File Number's  23540N, 249420N).     When on- or off-site mitigation is required by the Corps as a  condition of a Section 404 permit to fill certain wetlands, there is  often low probability that affected Central California tiger salamander  habitat functions (if any) would actually be compensated and replaced  by the ensuing mitigation action(s).     Semlitsch (1998) examined published literature for six species of  pond-breeding ambystomatid salamanders from five states and concluded  that a buffer zone encompassing 95 percent of a given population would  need to extend 263 m (534 ft) from a wetland's edge into surrounding  terrestrial habitat in order to give adequate protection. More  recently, Trenham (2001), although cautioning that essential  terrestrial habitats and buffer requirements are still relatively  poorly understood, concluded certain populations of California tiger  salamanders have migrated distances of 670 m (2,200 ft) between  breeding ponds, and that plans to maintain local populations of  California tiger salamanders should include pond(s) surrounded by at  least 173 m (567 ft) wide buffers of terrestrial habitat occupied by  burrowing mammals. Preliminary results of a study located at Jepson  Prairie have determined that adult California tiger salamanders migrate  up to 400 m (1,312 ft) from their breeding pond (P. Trenham, pers.  comm. 2002).     Management plans that focus only on preserving ponds or wetlands,  without consideration for associated terrestrial habitat, are likely to  fail to maintain viable amphibian populations (Marsh and Trenham 2001).  However, even with inclusion of terrestrial habitat buffers, recent  studies have demonstrated that restored wetlands are often still only  partially successfully recolonized by the full amphibian assemblages  being targeted for restoration (Lehtinen and Galatowitsch  [[Page 28659]]  2001; Pechmann et al. 2001). Successful compensatory mitigation for  losses of California tiger salamander pool and pond habitat due to  filling would also require the connectivity of the restoration site to  other pools and ponds (Gibbs 1998; Lehtinen et al. 1999; Marsh and  Trenham 2001; Trenham et al. 2001). Pond isolation may be an important  consideration in disturbed environments where inter-pond dispersal is  impeded by barriers such as roads and urban development (Marsh and  Trenham 2001). The California tiger salamander may also require large  preserves to maintain viable breeding populations and to allow  recolonizations after natural and anthropogenic local extirpations (P.  Northen, in litt. 2001).     We conclude that regulation of wetlands filling by the Corps under  Section 404 of the CWA is inadequate to protect the Central California  tiger salamander from further decline. Section 404 administration fails  to prevent losses of numerous small wetlands in California which may  support Central California tiger salamander breeding. Section 404 does  not regulate the continuing losses of Central California tiger  salamander terrestrial habitat (except to the extent certain  agricultural activities are regulated). When authorized fills under  Section 404 do result in compensatory mitigation for wetlands losses,  it is unlikely that Central California tiger salamander losses at  specific fill sites can, and will be, fully and successfully mitigated.     Endangered Species Act. Two DPSs of the California tiger salamander  in California have been listed under the Act. The Santa Barbara County  DPS was listed on September 15, 2000 (65 FR 3096). The Sonoma County  DPS was listed under an emergency rule effective July 22, 2002 (67 FR  4772). The final rule listing this DPS was published March 19, 2003 (68  FR 13497). These two DPSs are currently provided with the protections  afforded by the Act.     Elsewhere within its range in California, the California tiger  salamander is not currently a federally listed species under the Act.  Within this unprotected range in California, however, there are  currently 16 species (1 beetle, 4 species of freshwater shrimp, and 11  species of plants) listed under the Act that occur in association with  seasonally-flooded vernal pools. Critical habitat has been designated  for the threatened delta green ground beetle (Elaphrus viridus), but  its range is limited to a portion of the area at Jepson Prairie in  Solano County that is inhabited by the California tiger salamander. We  have also proposed approximately 687,968 ha (1.7 million ac) in 36  California Counties and one Oregon county as critical habitat  considered essential for the conservation of the 4 freshwater shrimp  and the 11 vernal pool plant species (68 FR 12336).     In some instances the vernal pools supporting the 15 listed vernal  pool species, and the critical habitat being proposed for them, overlap  with local occurrences of the Central California tiger salamander.  However, such overlap is limited, and where it does occur, regulatory  protections afforded under the Act for the 15 listed vernal pool  species, or their proposed critical habitat, do not convey adequate  protection to Central California tiger salamander upland habitats. Most  of the requirements of the listed vernal pool plants and freshwater  shrimp can be met through maintenance of existing hydrology within the  confines (or with additional upland areas dependent on the individual  location) of individual vernal pools or vernal pool complexes.  California tiger salamanders, on the other hand, spend only about 20  percent of their lives in such pools or ponds, and 80 percent in the  confines of small mammal burrows in nearby terrestrial areas.     Lacey Act. The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371-3378;  Pub. L. 97-79, as amended) provide some protection for the California  tiger salamander by making it illegal to trade in this species. This  legislation prohibits the import, export, sale, receipt, acquisition,  purchase, and engagement in interstate or foreign commerce of any  species taken, possessed, or sold in violation of any law, treaty, or  regulation of the United States, any Tribal law, or any law or  regulation of any State. The law covers all fish and wildlife and their  parts or products, and plants protected by State law. This Act does not  apply to the interstate shipment, through Tribal lands or a State, of  any fish, wildlife, or plant legally taken if the shipment goes to a  State in which the fish or wildlife or plant may be legally possessed. State     Since 1994, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) has  recognized the California tiger salamander as a ``species of special  concern.'' More recently, the California tiger salamander has been  placed on the State's list of protected amphibians, which means that it  cannot be taken without a special permit issued for scientific  collecting or research. Also, as stated earlier in Factor C, the  California Code of Regulations (2002) specifies California tiger  salamanders can no longer be taken, possessed, or used for fishing  bait.     On July 6, 2001, the CDFG received a petition from the CBD to list  the California tiger salamander under the California Endangered Species  Act. The status of the animal and potential threats was evaluated by  the CDFG. On October 3, 2001, the Director of the CDFG recommended to  the California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) that the petition  be accepted and the animal be designated as a candidate (R. Hight,  CDFG, in litt. 2001). On December 7, 2001, the Commission found that  the petition was not warranted because the Commissioners felt there was  not enough information on the population abundance and trend  information of the California tiger salamander (R. Treanor, Commission,  in litt. 2001).     CDFG recognizes the importance of California tiger salamander  conservation at the local population level and routinely considers and  recommends actions to mitigate potential adverse effects to the species  during its review of development proposals. However, CDFG's primary  regulatory venue is under the California Environmental Quality Act  (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Sec. 21000-21177). CEQA has proven to be  a variable, and often inadequate, regulatory mechanism for providing  protection to the California tiger salamander and its habitat.     CEQA requires a full disclosure of the potential environmental  impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary authority  or jurisdiction over a project is designated as the lead agency, and is  responsible for conducting a review of the project and consulting with  the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the  project. Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines, as amended, requires a  finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the  number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.''  Once significant effects are identified, the lead agency must require  mitigation for effects through changes in the project unless specific  overriding considerations make mitigation infeasible (CEQA Sec. 21002).  In the latter case, projects that may include the destruction of listed  endangered species or their habitat may be approved.     Moreover, neither CEQA nor other statutory mechanisms under CDFG's  jurisdiction provides any effective regulatory mechanisms for reducing  or eliminating several of the other manmade factors (as discussed  below)  [[Page 28660]]  which may also adversely affect California tiger salamanders and their  habitat. For example, there is no State regulation of nonnative fish  stocking into California tiger salamander ponds and waters. Agencies  and individuals may purchase (from CDFG-licensed fish breeders) and  stock into such waters sunfish, catfish and other nonnative fish for  recreational fishing. Similarly, there is no State regulation of  western mosquitofish stocking into California tiger salamander ponds  and waters by the approximately 50 mosquito abatement districts that  routinely stock this mosquito predator as a means for mosquito control.  In addition, the act of controlling burrowing small mammals in places  where their burrows may be highly essential to California tiger  salamander survival is not State-regulated and is, therefore, still  widely and commonly practiced throughout the California tiger  salamander's range. Local     We are not aware of any specific county or city ordinances or  regulations that provide protection for the Central California tiger  salamander. The Central California tiger salamander may be indirectly  benefitting from the increased attention being given to conversions of  grasslands, oak woodlands, row-crops, and other agricultural uses to  vineyards and orchards. At least three Counties (Sonoma, Napa, and  Santa Barbara) have recently begun applying regulatory oversight to  such conversions. This oversight is resulting in requirements for full- scale environmental analyses, restrictions on the steepness of slopes  onto which vineyards may be established, and requirements for erosion  control plans and measures. However, in the majority of the State's  Counties in the Central California tiger salamander's range,  conversions to vineyards and orchards is an unregulated agricultural  activity with significant potential to adversely affect the Central  California tiger salamander.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence      Several other factors may also be causing direct or indirect  adverse effects to California tiger salamanders or their habitat,  including direct mortality while they are crossing roads, the species'  extensive hybridization with nonnative salamanders, their exposure to  various contaminants, the effects from rodent population control  efforts, livestock grazing, and decreased population viability because  of the species' small remaining population size. Contaminants     Like most amphibians, California tiger salamanders inhabit both  aquatic and terrestrial habitats at different stages in their life  cycle, and are likely exposed to a variety of pesticides and other  chemicals throughout their range. They are extremely sensitive to these  pollutants due to their highly permeable skin which can rapidly absorb  pollutant substances (Blaustein and Wake 1990). Toxins at lower than  lethal levels may still have adverse effects, such as causing  abnormalities in larva and behavioral anomalies in adults, both of  which could eventually lead to lethal effects (Hall and Henry 1992;  Blaustein and Johnson 2003). California tiger salamanders also could  die from starvation due to the reduction or loss of their prey base  from the use of pesticides. Sources of chemical pollution which may  adversely affect California tiger salamanders include hydrocarbon and  other contaminants from oil production and road runoff; the application  of numerous chemicals for agricultural production; roadside maintenance  activities; urban/suburban landscaping applications; and rodent and  vector control programs.     Road mortality is not the only risk factor associated with roads,  as oil and other contaminants in runoff have been detected in adjacent  ponds and linked to die-offs and deformities in California tiger  salamanders and spadefoot toads, and die-offs of invertebrates that  form most of both species' prey base (S. Sweet, in litt. 1993). Lefcort  et al. (1997) found that oil had limited direct effects on 5-week-old  marbled (A. opacum) and tiger salamanders (A. t. tigrinum). However,  salamanders from oil-contaminated natural ponds metamorphosed earlier  at smaller sizes, and those from oil-contaminated artificial ponds had  slower growth rates than larvae raised in uncontaminated ponds. Their  studies did not address effects on eggs and early larval stages, where  the effects may be more pronounced.     Hatch and Burton (1998) and Monson et al. (1999) investigated the  effects of one component of petroleum products and urban runoff  (fluoranthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) on spotted  salamanders (A. maculatum), northern leopard frogs (R. pipiens), and  African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). In laboratory and outdoor  experiments, using levels of the contaminant comparable to those found  in service stations and other urban runoff, the researchers found  reduced survival and growth abnormalities in all species. The effects  were worse when the larvae were exposed to the contaminant under  natural levels of sunlight, rather than in the laboratory under  artificial light.     There are a number of records of California tiger salamanders using  roadside ditches. Many are in areas where there are no known breeding  ponds, and these animals are utilizing the only marginal habitat  remaining. Also, many pools in these areas have likely been destroyed,  leaving these marginal sites as the only option for breeding. In light  of increased urbanization, along with concurrent increases in traffic,  the risk factor associated with contaminants in runoff likely will  increase in both roadside ditches and across the general landscape. Agricultural and Landscaping Contaminants     During 2001, the 23 California Counties where California tiger  salamanders may occur used over 47,627,160 kilograms (105 million  pounds) of pesticide active ingredients (California Department of  Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) internet website 2002). Chemicals included  were metam-sodium, methyl bromide, mancozeb, petroleum oil, phosmet,  chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, parathion, paraquat dichloride, fosetyl- aluminum, acephate, cryolite, malathion, and other chemicals, some of  which are extremely toxic to aquatic organisms, including amphibians  and the organisms on which they prey. Some of these pesticides, such as  chloropyrifos, malathion, and endosulfin are cholenesterase inhibitors.  Reduced cholenesterase activity has been linked to uncoordinated  swimming, increased vulnerability to predation, depressed growth rates,  and increased mortality in tadpoles (de Llamas et al. 1985; Rosenbaum  et al. 1988; Bridges 1997; Berrill et al. 1998; Sparling et al. 2001).     Although there is some evidence that some amphibians may be  affected by chemicals applied during the migration and dispersal  seasons (Sparling et al. 2001), Davidson et al. (2001, 2002) were  unable to find a significant overall relationship between upwind  agriculture and the California tiger salamander's decline. Rodent Control     California tiger salamanders spend much of their lives in  underground retreats, often in California ground squirrel burrows  (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a), so widespread control of ground  squirrels may pose threats to the salamander. California ground  squirrel control, which began in the early 1900s (Marsh 1987), may be  done  [[Page 28661]]  by trapping, shooting, fumigation of burrows, use of toxic (including  anticoagulant) baits, and habitat modification, including deep-ripping  of burrow areas (UCIPM internet website 2003).     California ground squirrel control programs are widely conducted  (frequently via bait stations placed at specific problem sites) on and  around various commercial agricultural operations, including grazing/ range lands and various croplands including vineyards (R. Thompson,  Science Applications International Corporation, in litt. 1998). Also,  numerous agencies, particularly flood control agencies and levee  districts, conduct extensive California ground squirrel control  programs around levees, canals and other facilities they manage.     The pocket gopher, which also provides the required upland retreats  for some California tiger salamanders (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham  1998a; D. Cook, pers. comm. 2001), is targeted by certain control  operations that may also pose threats to the amphibian. This species is  also classified as a non-game mammal by CDFG. Pocket gopher control  measures (UCIPM internet website 2003) are similar to measures used for  California ground squirrel control, except that shooting is not an  effective approach because of the pocket gophers' nearly continuous  seclusion underground. Pocket gopher control typically is most common  around golf courses and other large, landscaped areas, and around  residential homes and gardens. Widespread control in agricultural  situations is much less common than for California ground squirrels.     Two of the most commonly used rodenticides, chlorophacinone and  diphacinone, are anticoagulants that cause animals to bleed to death.  These chemicals can be absorbed through the skin and are considered  toxic to fish and wildlife (EPA 1985; EXOTONET 1996). These two  chemicals, along with strychnine, are used to control rodents (R.  Thompson, in litt. 1998). Although the effects of these poisons on  California tiger salamander have not been assessed, any uses in close  proximity to occupied Central California tiger salamander habitat could  have various direct and indirect toxic effects. Gases, including  aluminum phosphide, carbon monoxide, and methyl bromide, are used in  rodent fumigation operations and are introduced into burrows by either  using cartridges or by pumping. When such fumigants are used, animals  inhabiting the fumigated burrow are killed (Salmon and Schmidt 1984).     In addition to possible direct adverse effects of rodent control  chemicals and gasses, California ground squirrel and pocket gopher  control operations may have the indirect effect of reducing the number  of upland burrows available to specific California tiger salamander  populations (Loredo-Prendeville et al. 1994). Because the burrow  density required by California tiger salamanders is unknown, the  impacts of burrow loss are also unknown.     Shaffer et al. (1993) believe that rodent control programs could be  the cause for lack of California tiger salamanders in certain areas.  Active California ground squirrel colonies probably are needed to  sustain California tiger salamanders, because inactive burrow systems  likely become progressively unsuitable over time. Loredo et al. (1996)  found that burrow systems usually collapsed within 18 months following  cessation of California ground squirrel use, and did not report  California tiger salamanders utilizing any collapsed burrows. Also,  deep ripping of rodent burrow areas as a rodent control measure would  be likely to completely destroy burrows and harm or kill any California  tiger salamanders using them.     Many Central California tiger salamander sites are currently  occupied by livestock. Livestock owners' concern over livestock  breaking their legs in rodent burrows is a reason for many California  ground squirrel control efforts, especially around livestock watering  tanks and ponds. These and other California ground squirrel and pocket  gopher control efforts clearly have potential to adversely affect  Central California tiger salamanders if they are implemented without  knowledge of, and concern for, the species. Mosquito Control     In addition to the use of western mosquitofish, a common chemical  method of mosquito control in California involves the use of  methoprene. Methoprene is an insect hormone mimic which increases the  level of juvenile hormone in insect larvae and disrupts the molting  process. Lawrenz (1984, 1985) found that methoprene (Altosoid SR-10)  retarded the development of selected crustacea that had the same  molting hormones (i.e., juvenile hormone) as insects, and anticipated  that the same hormone may control metamorphosis in other arthropods.  Because the success of many aquatic vertebrates relies on an abundance  of invertebrates in temporary wetlands, any delay in insect growth  could reduce the numbers and density of prey available (Lawrenz 1984,  1985). The use of methoprene could have an indirect adverse effect on  California tiger salamanders by reducing the availability of prey.     In more recent studies, methoprene did not cause increased  mortality of gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles (Sparling and  Lowe 1998). However, it caused reduced survival rates and increased  malformations in northern leopard frogs (Ankley et al. 1998), and  increased malformations in southern leopard frogs (R. utricularia)  (Sparling 1998). Blumberg et al. (1998) correlated exposure to  methoprene with delayed metamorphosis and high mortality rates in  northern leopard and mink (R. septentrionalis) frogs. Methoprene  appears to have both direct and indirect effects on the growth and  survival of larval amphibians. Road-Crossing Mortality     Although no systematic studies of the California tiger salamander  have been conducted, it is known that significant numbers of the  species in other portions of its range are killed by vehicular traffic  while crossing roads (Hansen and Tremper 1993; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993;  Joe Medeiros, Sierra College, pers. comm. 1993). For example, during  one 15-day period in 2001 at a Sonoma County location, 26 road-killed  California tiger salamanders were found (D. Cook, pers. comm. 2002).  Overall breeding population losses of California tiger salamanders due  to road kills have been estimated to be between 25 and 72 percent  (Twitty 1941; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993; Launer and Fee l996). Mortality  may be increased by associated roadway curbs and berms as low as 9 to  12 centimeters (3 to 5 in), which allow California tiger salamanders  access to roadways but prevent their exit from them (Launer and Fee  1996; S. Sweet, in litt. 1998).     Vehicular usage on California roads is increasing rapidly and  directly with human population and urban expansion. During November  2002, California's estimated total vehicular travel on State highway  system roads alone was 23 billion km (14.27 billion mi) (this figure  and subsequent vehicular-use data from California Department of  Transportation's internet website 2003). From 1972 to 2001, State  highway system total vehicular usage rose steadily from 108.6 km to 270  billion km (67.1 to 167.8 billion mi) annually. For the 23 California  Counties in which the California tiger salamander may occur, State  highway system total annual vehicular usage in 1999, 2000, and 2001 was  86.0, 90.0, and 92.1 billion km (53.3, 55.9, and 57.2 billion  [[Page 28662]]  mi), respectively. Moreover, for the four areas of the State in which  the four remaining population segments of the California tiger  salamander occur, road densities due to past urbanization are already  high. Overall, these four areas have 5,860.2 km (3,641.5 mi) of roads  (and rail tracks) of all types. The range of current road (and rail)  density is from 1.01 km per 100 ha (0.25 mi per 100 ac) in the Southern  San Joaquin population of the salamander, to 1.64 km per 100 ha (0.41  mi per 100 ac) in the Bay Area population of the salamander. We believe  such relatively high road-use and road-density values result in road- kill mortality being a potentially serious threat to the species, and a  threat that is likely continuing to grow in concert with the State's  rapid growth of human population and urbanization. Hybridization With Nonnative Salamanders     Sixteen populations of hybrid California tiger salamanders and the  nonnative tiger salamander (A. tigrinum) were found in southern Santa  Clara, eastern Merced, San Benito, and northern Monterey Counties  (Shaffer and Trenham 2002). Four populations consisting of pure  nonnative tiger salamanders were located in Monterey County (Shaffer  and Trenham 2002). The tiger salamanders at a number of locations in  this area reportedly are the result of intentional introductions of the  animals by a bait salesman in the 1950s and 1960s (B. Shaffer, pers.  comm. 2002).     Hybrids between the California tiger salamander and the nonnative  tiger salamander have been documented elsewhere in the range of A.  californiese (Shaffer and Trenham 2002). Introduced salamanders may  out-compete the California tiger salamander or interbreed with the  natives to produce hybrids that may be less fit and adapted to the  California climate or are not reproductively viable past the first or  second generations (Bury and Lukenbach 1976; Shaffer et al. 1993). More  recent evidence suggests that the hybrids are viable and that they  breed with California tiger salamanders (Shaffer and Trenham 2002).  Over time, a population of a species could become genetically  indistinguishable from a larger population of an introgressing species  such that the true genotype (the genetic constitution of an individual  or group) of the lesser species no longer exists (Levin 2002). The loss  of any population of the Central California tiger salamander due to  hybridization with, or competition from, introduced species is of  serious concern. Livestock Grazing     Light to moderate livestock (cattle, sheep, and horses) grazing is  generally thought to be compatible with the continued successful use of  rangelands by the Central California tiger salamander, provided the  grazed areas do not also have intensive burrowing rodent control  efforts (T. Jones, in litt. 1993; Shaffer et al. 1993; S. Sweet, pers.  comm. 1998; H. Shaffer and P. Trenham, pers. comm. 2003). By  maintaining shorter vegetation, grazing may make areas more suitable  for California ground squirrels whose burrows are essential to  California tiger salamanders. Melanson (in litt. 1993) noted that  although vernal pool species continued to reproduce under a November to  April grazing regime, California tiger salamanders were either absent  or diminished in numbers in portions of pools heavily trampled by  cattle. Repeated trampling of pond edges by cattle also can increase  the surface area of ponds which may increase water temperature and  evaporation rate, thus reducing the amount of time the pond contains  water (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998).     Reduction in water quality cause by livestock excrement may  negatively affect the California tiger salamander by increasing  nitrogen and silt levels. High nitrogen levels are associated with  bacterial blooms and lowered dissolved oxygen (Worthylake and Hovingh  1989), and silt has been associated with fatal fungal infections  (Lefcort et al. 1997), as discussed earlier under Factor C.     However, grazing generally is compatible with the continued use of  rangelands by the Central California tiger salamander as long as  intensive burrowing rodent control programs are not implemented on such  areas and grazing is not excessive (T. Jones, in litt. 1993; Shaffer et  al. 1993; S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998).  Conclusion      In making this proposal, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the Central California tiger  salamander. As discussed in the Summary of Factors Affecting the  Species above, this species faces a number of threats. The most  overwhelming threat is from continuing habitat destruction,  degradation, and fragmentation. Secondary threats exist from predation  and competition from introduced exotic species; possible commercial  overutilization; disease; hybridization with nonnative salamanders;  various chemical contaminants; road-crossing mortality; and rodent  control operations. The various primary and secondary threats are not  currently being offset by existing Federal, State, or local regulatory  mechanisms. The Central California tiger salamander also is vulnerable  to chance environmental or demographic events. The combination of its  biology and specific habitat requirements makes the animal susceptible  to random events, such as drought, disease, and other occurrences. Such  events are not usually a concern until the number of breeding/ estivation sites or geographic distribution become severely limited, as  is the case with the Central California tiger salamander.  Critical Habitat      Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as the--(i)  specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at  the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found  those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation  of the species, and (II) that may require special management  considerations or protection, and (ii) specific areas outside the  geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed in  accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Act, upon a  determination by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the  conservation of the species. ``Conservation'' means the use of all  methods and procedures needed to bring the species to the point at  which listing under the Act is no longer necessary.     Section 4(a)(3) of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR  424.12) require that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable,  the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) designate critical habitat at  the time the species is determined to be endangered or threatened. Our  implementing regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)) state that critical habitat  is not determinable if information sufficient to perform the required  analysis of impacts of the designation is lacking, or if the biological  needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to allow  identification of an area as critical habitat. Section 4(b)(2) of the  Act requires us to consider economic and other relevant impacts of  designating a particular area as critical habitat on the basis of the  best scientific data available. The Secretary may exclude any area from  critical habitat if she determines that the benefits of such exclusion  outweigh the conservation benefits, unless to do so would result in the  extinction of the species.  [[Page 28663]]      In 30 years of implementing the ESA, we have found that the  designation of statutory critical habitat provides little additional  protection to most listed species, while consuming significant amounts  of scarce conservation resources. The present system for designating  critical habitat has evolved since its original statutory prescription  into a process that provides little real conservation benefit, is  driven by litigation and the courts rather than biology, limits our  ability to fully evaluate the science involved, consumes enormous  agency resources, and imposes huge social and economic costs. We  believe that rational public policy demands serious attention to this  issue in order to allow our focus to return to true conservation  efforts.     While attention to and protection of habitat is paramount to  successful conservation actions, we have consistently found that, in  most circumstances, the designation of critical habitat is of little  additional value for most listed species, yet it consumes large amounts  of conservation resources. Sidle (1987) stated, ``Because the ESA can  protect species with and without critical habitat designation, critical  habitat designation may be redundant to the other consultation  requirements of section 7.''     Currently, only 306 species or 25 percent of the 1,211 listed  species in the U.S. under the jurisdiction of the Service have  designated critical habitat. We address the habitat needs of all 1,211  listed species through conservation mechanisms such as listing, section  7 consultations, the section 4 recovery planning process, the section 9  protective prohibitions of unauthorized take, section 6 funding to the  States, and the section 10 incidental take permit process. We believe  that these measures are superior conservation strategies compared to  the designation of critical habitat.     We have been inundated with lawsuits for our failure to designate  critical habitat, and we face a growing number of lawsuits challenging  critical habitat determinations once they are made. These lawsuits have  subjected the Service to an ever-increasing series of court orders and  court-approved settlement agreements, compliance with which now  consumes nearly the entire listing program budget. This leaves the  Service with little ability to prioritize its activities to direct  scarce listing resources to the listing program actions with the most  biologically urgent species conservation needs.     The consequence of the critical habitat litigation activity is that  limited listing funds are used to defend active lawsuits, to respond to  Notices of Intent (NOIs) to sue relative to critical habitat, and to  comply with the growing number of adverse court orders. As a result,  listing petition responses, the Service's own proposals to list  critically imperiled species, and final listing determinations on  existing proposals are significantly delayed. Litigation over critical  habitat issues for species already listed and receiving the Act's full  protection has precluded or delayed many listing actions nationwide.     The accelerated schedules of court ordered designations have left  the Service with almost no ability to confirm the scientific data in  its administrative record or to respond in any meaningful way to  legitimate comments before making decisions on listing and critical  habitat proposals due to the risks associated with noncompliance with  judicially-imposed deadlines. This in turn fosters a second round of  litigation in which those who fear adverse impacts from critical  habitat designations challenge those designations. The cycle of  litigation appears endless, is very expensive, and in the final  analysis provides relatively little additional protection to listed  species.     The costs resulting from the designation include legal costs, the  cost of preparation and publication of the designation, the analysis of  the economic effects and the cost of requesting and responding to  public comment, and in some cases the costs of compliance with NEPA,  all are part of the cost of critical habitat designation. None of these  costs result in any benefit to the species that is not already afforded  by the protections of the Act enumerated earlier, and they directly  reduce the funds available for direct and tangible conservation  actions.     We determine that, designation of critical habitat for the Central  California tiger salamander would be prudent, if we reach a final  determination to list the species as proposed. However, we do not  intend to propose critical habitat at this time. Our budget for listing  activities is currently insufficient to allow us to immediately  complete all the listing actions required by the Act. Not designating  critical habitat at this time allows us to provide the necessary  protections needed for the conservation of the species without further  delay. This is consistent with section 4(b)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, which  states that final listing decisions may be issued without critical  habitat designations when it is essential that such determinations be  promptly published. The legislative history of the 1982 Act amendments  also emphasized this point: ``The Committee feels strongly, however,  that, where biology relating to the status of the species is clear, it  should not be denied the protection of the Act because of the inability  of the Secretary to complete the work necessary to designate critical  habitat * * * . The committee expects the agencies to make the  strongest attempt possible to determine critical habitat within the  time period designated for listing, but stresses that the listing of  species is not to be delayed in any instance past the time period  allocated for such listing if the biological data is clear but the  habitat designation process is not complete'' (H.R. Rep. No. 97-567 at  20 (1982)). We will prepare a critical habitat designation in the  future when our available resources allow.     We will protect the Central California tiger salamander and its  habitat through section 7 consultations to determine whether Federal  actions are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the  species, through the recovery process, and through enforcement of take  prohibitions under section 9 of the Act.  Available Conservation Measures      Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  practices. Recognition through listing encourages conservation actions  by Federal, State, and local agencies. The Act provides for possible  land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that  recovery actions be carried out for listed species. We discuss the  protection from the actions of Federal agencies, considerations for  protection and conservation actions, and the prohibitions against  taking and harm for the Central California tiger salamander, in part,  below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed to  be listed or is listed as endangered or threatened, and with respect to  its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations  implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are  codified at 50 CFR part 402. Federal agencies are required to confer  with us informally on any action that is likely to jeopardize the  continued existence of a proposed species, or result in destruction or  adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is  listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to  ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry  [[Page 28664]]  out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a  species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a  Federal agency action may affect a listed species or its critical  habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal  consultation with us. Federal agency actions that may affect the  Central California tiger salamander and may require consultation with  us include, but are not limited to, those within the jurisdiction of  the Corps and Federal Highway Administration (FHA).     We believe that protection and recovery of the Central California  tiger salamander will require reduction of the threats from destruction  and degradation of wetland and associated upland habitats due to urban  development, exotic predators, unnecessary California ground squirrel  and gopher control, and road construction. These threats should be  considered when management actions are taken in habitats currently and  potentially occupied by the Central California tiger salamander, and  areas deemed important for dispersal and connectivity or corridors  between known locations of this species. Monitoring also should be  undertaken for management actions or scientific investigations designed  to address these threats or their impacts.     Listing also will require us to review any actions that may affect  the Central California tiger salamander for lands and activities under  Federal jurisdiction, State plans developed pursuant to section 6 of  the Act, scientific investigations of efforts to enhance the  propagation or survival of the animal, pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A)  of the Act, and habitat conservation plans (HCPs) prepared for non- Federal lands and activities pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act.     Federal agencies with management responsibility for the Central  California tiger salamander include the Service, in relation to the  issuance of section 10(a)(1)(A and B) permits for HCPs and other  programs. Occurrences of this species could potentially be affected by  projects requiring a permit from the Corps under Section 404 of the  CWA. The Corps is required to consult with us on applications they  receive for projects that may affect listed species. Highway  construction and maintenance projects that receive funding from the FHA  would be subject to review under section 7 of the Act. In addition,  activities that are authorized, funded, or administered by Federal  agencies on non-Federal lands will be subject to section 7 review.     The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set  forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, codified at 50 CFR 17.21, in  part make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the  United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot,  wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect; or attempt any such conduct),  import, export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the  course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate  or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,  sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has  been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to our agents and State  conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving endangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations  governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits  are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or  survival of the species, and for incidental take in connection with  otherwise lawful activities. Requests for copies of the regulations on  listed species and inquiries about prohibitions and permits may be  addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species  Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, OR 97232-4181 (telephone: 503/ 231-2063, facsmile: 503/231-6243).     It is our policy, as published in the Federal Register on July 1,  1994 (59 FR 34272), to identify, to the maximum extent practicable at  the time a species is listed, those activities that would or would not  constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this  policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on  proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range. We believe  that, based on the best available information, the following actions  are not likely to result in a violation of section 9, provided these  actions are carried out in accordance with any existing regulations and  permit requirements:     (1) Possession, delivery, including interstate transport and import  or export from the United States, involving no commercial activity, of  Central California tiger salamanders that were collected prior to the  date of publication of a final regulation in the Federal Register  adding the Central California tiger salamander to the list of  endangered and threatened species;     (2) Any actions that may affect the Central California tiger  salamander that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal  agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with the  consultation requirements for listed species pursuant to section 7 of  the Act;     (3) Any action taken for scientific research carried out under a  recovery permit issued by the Service pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A)  of the Act;     (4) Land actions or management carried out under an HCP approved by  the Service pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act, or an approved  conservation agreement; and     (5) Release of western mosquitofish and the use of pesticides in  non-breeding habitat for the California tiger salamander. Breeding  habitat is defined as vernal pools, seasonal ponds, and stock-watering  ponds where the animals currently breed, or such water bodies that are  within 4.8 km (3.0 mi) of existing breeding habitat, and that contain  surface water for at least 3 consecutive months between September and  April on average over various precipitation year-types.     Activities that we believe could potentially result in a violation  of section 9 of the Act include, but are not limited to, the following:     (1) Unauthorized possession, collecting, trapping, capturing,  killing, harassing, sale, delivery, or movement, including intrastate,  interstate, and foreign commerce, or harming, or attempting any of  these actions, of California tiger salamanders. Research activities  where salamanders are trapped or captured will require a permit under  section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Act;     (2) Any activity not carried out pursuant to the proposed special  rule in ``Sec.  17.43 Special rules--amphibians'' that results in  destruction or significant alteration of habitat of the Central  California tiger salamander, which actually kills or injures an  individual of the species, including, but not limited to, the discharge  of fill material, or the withdrawal of water to the point at which  habitat becomes unsuitable for the species.     (3) Discharges or dumping of toxic chemicals, silt, or other  pollutants into, or other alteration of, the quality of waters  supporting California tiger salamanders that results in death or injury  of the species or that results in degradation of their occupied habitat  which actually kills or injures an individual of the species;     (4) Release of exotic species (including, but not limited to,  bullfrogs, tiger salamanders, mosquitofish, bass, sunfish, bullhead,  catfish, crayfish) into Central California tiger salamander breeding  habitat which results in actual death or injury to the species;  [[Page 28665]]      (5) Destruction or alteration of uplands associated with seasonal  pools used by Central California tiger salamanders during estivation  and dispersal, or modification of migration routes such that migration  and dispersal are reduced or precluded and actual death or injury to  the species results; and     (6) Activities (e.g., habitat conversion, excessive livestock  grazing, road and trail construction, recreation, development, and  unauthorized application of herbicides and pesticides in violation of  label restrictions) that directly or indirectly result in the death or  injury of larvae, sub-adult, or adult Central California tiger  salamanders, or modify Central California tiger salamander habitat and  significantly affect their essential behavioral patterns including  breeding, foraging, sheltering, or other life functions, causing actual  death or injury to the species. Otherwise lawful activities that  incidentally take Central California tiger salamanders, but have no  Federal nexus, will require a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act.     Questions regarding whether specific activities would constitute a  violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of  the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section).  Special Rule      Section 4(d) of the Act provides authority for us to promulgate  special rules for threatened species that would relax specific  prohibitions against taking. As a means to promote conservation efforts  of the Central California tiger salamander, we are proposing a special  rule under section 4(d) of the Act. In the case of a special rule, the  general regulations applying most section 9 prohibitions to threatened  species do not apply to that species, and the special rule contains the  prohibitions necessary and appropriate to conserve that species. Under  the rule, take of the threatened Central California tiger salamander  caused by existing routine ranching activities on private or Tribal  lands that don't have a Federal nexus would be exempt from section 9 of  the Act. We believe that this special rule will encourage landowners  and ranchers to continue their livestock-related practices that are not  only important for livestock operations, but also provide habitat for  the Central California tiger salamander. Livestock use on Federal lands  will be addressed through the section 7 process.     Such regulations generally are issued and published as special  rules in the Federal Register along with, or following, the listing of  a species. In this case, we have chosen to concurrently publish this  proposed special rule along with our proposal to list the Central  California tiger salamander as threatened. We are proposing this  special rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act containing  the actions and prohibitions necessary to provide for the conservation  of the Central California tiger salamander. The prohibitions we propose  do not include the take of Central California tiger salamander during  existing routine ranching practices, which are already listed as  endangered. If this proposed special rule is finalized, the general  regulations at 50 CFR 17.31 would not apply to the Central California  tiger salamander where it is designated as threatened. Our rationale  for a proposed special rule follows.     The proposed rule to list the Central California tiger salamander  as a threatened species identifies the take of the species in upland  and aquatic habitats as one of many possible reasons for the decline of  the animal. The proposed listing describes the potential loss of  Central California tiger salamanders to activities routinely occurring  on private and Tribal lands. The specific focus of this proposed  special rule is routine activities occurring on private and Tribal  lands currently in or that may become subject to ranching practices,  such as livestock grazing, rodent control, stock pond management, and  noxious weed control.     In areas where seasonal water bodies (e.g., vernal pools) no longer  exist due to landscape changes or alteration of local hydrologic  conditions, the Central California tiger salamander utilizes manmade  water supplies such as stock ponds for breeding (Stebbins 1985; Zeiner  et al. 1988; Shaffer et al. 1993). The creation and maintenance of  these ponds provides not only an alternate breeding site for Central  California tiger salamanders, in the absence of naturally occurring  sites, but also provides additional breeding habitat as well. Routine  management practices on manmade water supplies such as stock ponds must  be performed in order to protect water supplies and protect the  integrity of the water storage system. Management typically includes  periodic dredging, dam and levee repair, the introduction of fish  species to control aquatic vegetation and pests, and the chemical  control of aquatic vegetation.     The Central California tiger salamander uses burrows constructed by  small mammals as upland habitat during the non-breeding season (Loredo  et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a). The California ground squirrel is a very  common resident small mammal found in nearly all regions of California,  excluding the Basin Ranges, and the Mojave and Colorado Desert regions.  Its range overlaps significantly with the Central California tiger  salamander. The California ground squirrel is considered a pest over  large agricultural areas and frequently is subject to some form of  population control.  Justification      Our analysis indicates that this special rule will affect  approximately 222,162 ha (548,972 ac) or 49 percent of the range of the  Central California tiger salamander. This special rule will apply to  land primarily used for livestock grazing. Discussions with Dr. Peter  Trenham and Dr. Brad Shaffer, both with the University of California,  and Dr. Gary Fellers of the U.S. Geological Survey, lead us to believe  that livestock grazing, in many cases, has positive, or at least  neutral, effects on the Central California tiger salamander. Vegetation  height and density are likely habitat factors affecting the suitability  of an area for California ground squirrels. The presence of California  ground squirrels and their burrows provide upland habitat for the  Central California tiger salamander. Two beneficial effects to Central  California tiger salamanders that would occur as a result of exempting  livestock grazing in this special rule: The maintenance of open  rangelands that are utilized by the salamander, and the construction  and maintenance of stockponds that are used for breeding by the  species.     California ground squirrels typically construct burrows that range  in length from 1.5 to 9.1 m (5 to 30 ft) and range in depth below the  surface from 0.6 to 1.2 m (2 to 4 ft) (University of California 2002).  Central California tiger salamanders generally spend much of their  lives within the first 0.9 m (3 ft) of the burrow (Loredo and Van Vuren  1996). Both occupied and unoccupied burrows are utilized as upland  habitat (Loredo et al. 1996). Cattle and sheep, the two most common  domestic grazing animals in California, have coexisted with California  ground squirrels and Central California tiger salamanders since the  arrival of early Spaniard explorers to California in the 16th century.  It has not been demonstrated in the scientific literature, nor do we  expect, that continued moderate intensity livestock grazing will  destroy rodent burrows to such an extent that Central California tiger  salamanders cannot use them as upland habitat. Additionally, small  mammal burrows collapse naturally within 18 months if not maintained  (Loredo et al. 1996), so  [[Page 28666]]  we expect that Central California tiger salamanders are forced  naturally to move within or between burrows as they decay and collapse.     Control of vegetation by grazing livestock may encourage California  ground squirrels to colonize areas they typically would not colonize  due to the height and density of the vegetation. California ground  squirrels are active during daylight hours and are preyed upon by  diurnal raptors (birds of prey) such as red-tailed hawks (Buteo  jamaicensis), and by larger predatory mammals such as coyotes (Canis  latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Establishing home ranges in areas  where vegetation is controlled by grazing livestock provides an  advantage to California ground squirrels in being able to detect and  avoid predation by their natural predators. Also, less vegetation may  facilitate the movement of Central California tiger salamanders from  upland areas to breeding ponds. Lack of vegetation is not anticipated  to increase the risk of Central California tiger salamanders to  predators as they typically move during hours of darkness, and most  generally, during periods of rainfall. Nocturnal predators such as  owls, skunks (Mephitis sp.), and racoons (Procyon lotor) rely more on  their olfactory and auditory senses to locate prey than their vision.  Although the height of the surrounding vegetation may afford a slight  advantage to Central California tiger salamanders in avoiding  predators, we do not anticipate that vegetation height plays a  significant role in preventing depredation of Central California tiger  salamanders by nocturnal predators.     Central California tiger salamanders may be subject to take during  routine control of California ground squirrel populations on private  lands. The California ground squirrel can, in moderate to high- densities, significantly deplete forage for grazing livestock, thereby  reducing the carrying capacity on rangeland as well as irrigated  pasture land (Marsh 1994). Grinnell and Dixon (1918) calculated that  200 ground squirrels could consume as much forage as a 454 kilogram  (kg) (1,000 pounds (lbs)) steer during the spring months (Marsh 1998).  Most commonly, routine control of California ground squirrels and other  burrowing rodents includes shooting individual squirrels, baiting  squirrel burrows or colonies with poisonous grains, fumigating burrows  with toxic or suffocating gases, and discing or blading over burrow  openings to destroy burrow complexes and fill openings.     Shooting individual squirrels, while potentially harmful to other  species through secondary lead poisoning, is not expected to have  adverse effects on Central California tiger salamanders. To be  effective, a population must be kept under constant shooting pressure  which is time consuming and not cost effective over the long-term.  Discing and/or blading burrow complexes to destroy burrows and fill  burrow openings may result in take of Central California tiger  salamanders. Although the extent of this practice has not been  documented, conversations with landowners lead us to believe this  activity generally does not occur over widespread areas on any given  parcel of land. Generally, this type of activity is limited to areas in  or near ranch buildings, and in areas where livestock tend to be  concentrated (e.g., corrals and watering areas). Poisonous grains such  as Chlorophacinone [reg]  and toxic and suffocating gases  (e.g., Phostoxin [reg] ) are regulated by the EPA, CDPR, and  other county and local ordinances. Toxic and suffocating gases also may  result in high levels of salamander mortality. In areas where federally  listed species are known to occur, regulations on the use of toxicants  to control California ground squirrels are more restrictive, and these  restrictions should provide an ``umbrella'' protection for Central  California tiger salamanders from take associated with routine ground  squirrel control. In Counties where more stringent guidelines are not  in place to protect listed species, we will continue to work with  agencies to develop use guidelines for these products and activities.     California's annual precipitation ranges from less than 20 cm (8  in) in the San Joaquin Valley to more than 127 cm (50 in) along the  northern coast range, western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and  parts of the Cascade Range (National Climatic Data Center 2003).  Summers are dry with little or no rainfall, and abnormally dry winters  can be disastrous on both summer water supplies and the quality of  feeding ranges for domestic livestock. In some areas of California,  spring/summer range usually does not support more than one cow-calf  unit per 4 to 8 ha (10 to 20 ac) of range, with each cow being able to  consume up to 57 liters (15 gallons) of water per day per 454 kg (1,000  lbs) of body weight (Ohlenbusch et al. 1995). Considering the limited  availability of naturally occurring water across California's  rangeland, routine management of stock ponds is critical to the  economic success of ranching operations. During heavy winter rain  events, stock pond dams and levees may be subject to overflows that  cause severe erosion (head-cutting) of the dam faces and containment  levees. Without immediate repair, critical summer water supplies will  be lost. Pond vegetation is typically controlled by grazing animals  using the water supply. However, at times the vegetation must be  controlled through mechanical means or herbicide applications to  prevent excess loss of water supply through evapotranspiration, and to  prevent aquatic vegetation from completely dominating the pond. In some  ponds, fish are introduced to help control vegetation and insects.  However, this practice is limited to year-round ponds which are  typically not suitable habitat for Central California tiger salamander  reproduction.     We propose to include in this rule an exemption for incidental take  of Central California tiger salamanders during routine ranching  activities by non-Federal entities on private and Tribal lands for the  following activities: (1) Livestock grazing according to normally  acceptable and established levels of intensity in terms of the number  of head of livestock per acre of rangeland; (2) control of ground- burrowing rodents using poisonous grain according to the labeled  directions and local, State and Federal regulations and guidelines. The  use of toxic or suffocating gases is not exempt from the prohibitions  due to its non-target specific mode of action; (3) control and  management of burrow complexes using discing and grading to destroy  burrows and fill openings is exempt. This exemption does not apply to  large-scale discing or grading of rangeland (more than 4 ha (10 ac))  within any one-quarter section of a single township and range for  burrow control and management; (4) routine management and maintenance  of stock ponds and berms to maintain livestock water supplies at levels  present at the time of the listing of the Central California tiger  salamander. This exemption does not include the introduction of species  into the stock pond that may prey on Central California tiger  salamander adult, larvae, or eggs; or the introduction of chemicals  into the stock pond during the general breeding season of the Central  California tiger salamander that would result in the take of Central  California tiger salamander adults, larvae, or eggs, or result in  decreased reproductive success; and (5) control and management of  noxious weeds.  Provisions of the Proposed Special Rule      We propose to exempt existing routine ranching practices from the  prohibitions on take (see 50 CFR 17.31) for the Central California  tiger  [[Page 28667]]  salamander. The finalization of this special rule is contingent upon a  final listing of the Central California tiger salamander. Exempted  activities include existing routine ranching practices as outlined  above by non-Federal entities on existing rangeland (as defined by U.S.  Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service  1997 Census of Agriculture--Appendix (1)) except for the Sonoma County  DPS and Santa Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander,  which are already listed as endangered.  Take Prohibitions      We propose that the prohibitions under section 9 of the Act that  apply to threatened species continue to apply all California tiger  salamander populations, to the same extent that they apply to other  threatened species under our general regulations at 50 CFR 17.31.  Effects of the Special Rule on Future Section 7 Consultations      This special rule does not change the obligation of Federal  agencies to consult with us under section 7 of the Act concerning  actions they authorize, fund, or carry out that may affect listed  species, including the California tiger salamander.     Section 10(a)(1)(B) authorizes us to issue permits for the take of  listed species incidental to otherwise lawful activities, such as  agriculture, surface mining, and urban development. Incidental take  permits must be supported by an HCP that identifies conservation  measures that the permittee agrees to implement to conserve the  species, usually on the permittee's lands. Such conservation measures  may, for example, minimize the reduction in the number of California  ground squirrels whose burrows are used by estivating California tiger  salamanders. These and other techniques to avoid take of California  tiger salamanders or protect the species can be examined in the  development of an HCP, candidate conservation agreement with assurances  (while unlisted), or safe harbor agreement. A key element in our review  of each of these conservation strategies is a determination of the  plan's effect upon the long-term conservation of the species. We would  approve an HCP, and issue a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit, as appropriate,  if the plan would minimize and mitigate the impacts of the take to the  maximum extent practicable and would not appreciably reduce the  likelihood of the survival and recovery of that species in the wild.     We also are exploring other opportunities to permit conservation  activities for the California tiger salamander. In particular, we  encourage the public to comment on the desirability of promulgating a  special rule under section 4(d) of the Act that would exempt from the  section 9 take prohibition activities associated with conservation  plans for the California tiger salamander. Eligible conservation plans  would need to promote recovery and be approved by the Service.  Activities potentially addressed under such a plan, and which would be  exempt from the section 9 take provisions, could include, but are not  limited to, construction of new breeding and upland habitats, fencing,  and removal of bullfrogs or other exotic animals.  Reclassification of Santa Barbara County Population and Sonoma County  Population      As noted above, we published a final determination on January 19,  2000, listing the Santa Barbara County tiger salamander as endangered  (65 FR 3095). We hereby incorporate by reference in this document the  provisions of that final determination. We determined that, based on  geographic isolation, the lack of evidence of gene flow with other  populations, and marked genetic differentiation, the Santa Barbara  County population of California tiger salamanders meets the  discreteness and significance criteria in our Policy Regarding the  Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments and qualifies as  a DPS. In making this determination, we assessed the best scientific  and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and  future threats faced by the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders. Like the California tiger salamander, the  Santa Barbara population is restricted to breeding ponds threatened by  agricultural conversion, fragmentation, and development. Ponds and  upland habitats are being lost in all four regions of the county in  which the species occurs. On the other hand, the Santa Barbara  salamander occurs in a significant part of its historic range. There  are 14 known breeding sites all located on privately owned land, and no  conservation agreements or easements were in place as of the data of  the final listing determination.     Also as noted above, on March 19, 2003, we published a final  determination listing the Sonoma County tiger salamander as endangered  (68 FR 13497). We incorporate by reference here the provisions of that  determination. We determined that the population segment meets both the  discreteness and significance criteria of our DPS policy and qualifies  for listing. In making this determination, we carefully assessed the  best scientific and commercial information available at that time  regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by the Sonoma  County California tiger salamander. We found that the DPS faces  continuing habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. We were  able to identify only eight known breeding sites in Sonoma County.  However, we observed: ``We note that the petition and subsequent  emergency listing of this population has led to increased interest in  this population by a variety of parties, and thus to an acceleration of  the rate at which new information is becoming available. We expect this  trend to continue subsequent to this final listing determination'' (68  FR 13502).     The analysis of threats for the Santa Barbara and Sonoma  populations is virtually identical to that for the Central California  population which we are proposing for threatened status. The research  supporting the final Santa Barbara determination, the final Sonoma  determination and this proposed rule is the same. In both cases,  habitat loss is the apparent key threat. The remaining threats are  precisely the same. Obviously there are site-specific distinctions  which may be of significance. Given this identity of threat, it may be  that the populations should have the same status. Such a determination  may turn on a number of factors. For example, is the rate of habitat  conversion in Santa Barbara County and Sonoma County more or less that  of the 23-county area in which the Central California tiger salamander  population is found? Is the habitat remaining in the Central Valley  equivalent to that remaining in Santa Barbara County or Sonoma County?  Is the tiger salamander population more or less imperiled in Santa  Barbara and Sonoma Counties given that Santa Barbara's recent annual  growth rate has been about 1 percent, Sonoma's has been under 1  percent, and in the counties in the range of the Central California  tiger salamander, growth has averaged in excess of 1 percent  (California Department of Finance 2003)?     In the final rule to list the Sonoma County population, we  announced that: ``As a part of [this] rulemaking we intend to review  all then-current information regarding both the Sonoma County and Santa  Barbara County populations, including whether they constitute valid  distinct population segments, and render a final  [[Page 28668]]  determination on the California tiger salamander accordingly'' (68 FR  13502).     Pursuant to that announcement and given the potential issues  surrounding the correct status for the Sonoma and Santa Barbara  populations, we now propose the following:     (1) That the Sonoma County DPS of the California tiger salamander  be reclassified from endangered to threatened.     (2) That the Santa Barbara County DPS of the California tiger  salamander be reclassified from endangered to threatened.     (3) That the proposed special rule under section 4(d) of the ESA be  extended to the DPSs in Santa Barbara and Sonoma Counties, as well as  to the Central California DPS.     The basis for proposing that the special rule be extended to Santa  Barbara and Sonoma Counties is that our analysis in those areas, like  that in the range of the Central California tiger salamander, shows  that grazing generally is compatible with the continued use of  rangelands by the California tiger salamander as long as intensive  burrowing rodent control programs are not implemented on such areas and  grazing is not excessive. Indeed, in Santa Barbara County, the only  remaining sites with large amounts of suitable salamander habitat  (eight ponds at five sites) currently are being grazed. These  rangelands are the only undeveloped habitat in the area and thus  provide the only chance for salamanders to breed successfully.  Additionally, in all areas, to the extent that conversion of rangelands  to more intensive agricultural activity is postponed, conservation of  the tiger salamander will be enhanced.     If this proposal is finalized without change, all three DPSs will  have the same status. We are not, however, proposing at this time to  eliminate the DPSs in favor of a single listed population. We will take  public comment on that issue.  Public Comments Solicited      We intend that any final action resulting from this proposal will  be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, we are  soliciting comments from the public, other concerned governmental  agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested  party concerning this proposed rule. We are particularly seeking  comments concerning:     (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning  any threat (or lack thereof) to the California tiger salamander;     (2) The location of any additional populations or breeding sites of  this species, and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be  determined to be critical habitat pursuant to section 4 of the Act;     (3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and  population sizes of this species;     (4) Current or planned activities or land use practices in the  subject area and their possible impacts on this animal;     (5) Additional information pertaining to the promulgation of a  special rule to exempt from section 9 take prohibitions existing  routine ranching practices located on private and Tribal lands where  the Central DPS occurs; and     (6) Additional information pertaining to the Central, Sonoma  County, and Santa Barbara County populations, including data on their  validity as DPSs, or whether other designations, such as a single  rangewide designation or combinations of designations including  additional DPSs, is more appropriate.     If you wish to comment, you may submit your comments and materials  concerning this proposal by any one of several methods: (1) You may  submit written comments and information to the Field Supervisor at the  address provided in the ADDRESSES section above; (2) You also may  comment via the electronic mail (e-mail) to  catiger@R1.fws.gov . Please  submit e-mail comments as an ASCII file avoiding the use of special  characters and any form of encryption. Please also include ``Attn:  [1018-AI68]'' and your name and address in your e-mail message. If you  do not receive a confirmation from the system that we have received  your e-mail message, contact us directly by calling our Sacramento Fish  and Wildlife Office at telephone number 916/414-6600. Please note the  internet address  CATIGER@R1.fws.gov  will be terminated at the close of  the comment period; and (3) You may hand-deliver comments to our  Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section above).     Our practice is to make comments, including names and home  addresses of respondents, available for public review during regular  business hours. Commenters may request that we withhold their home  addresses from the rulemaking record, which we will honor to the extent  allowed by law. There also may be circumstances in which we would  withhold from the rulemaking record a commenter's identity, as  allowable by law. If you wish us to withhold your name and/or address,  you must state this prominently at the beginning of your comment.  However, we will not consider anonymous comments. We will make all  submissions from organizations or businesses, and from individuals  identifying themselves as representatives or officials of organizations  or businesses, available for public inspection in their entirety.  Comments and materials received will be available for public  inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above  address.  Public Hearings      The Act provides for one or more public hearings on this proposal,  if requested. Requests for public hearings must be made within 45 days  of the publication of a proposed rule (section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act).  Given the high likelihood of requests, and the need to proceed as  expeditiously as possible, the Service will hold public hearings on the  dates and locations described in the DATES and ADDRESSES sections  above.     The purpose of the public hearings announced here is to take oral  comments on the proposed listing. Oral comments will be transcribed and  will be given equal weight to comments submitted by other means.  However, we encourage those commenting orally to submit written  versions of their comments as well.     Persons needing reasonable accommodations in order to attend and  participate in a public hearing should contact the Field Supervisor of  the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section) as soon  as possible. In order to allow sufficient time to process requests,  please call no later than 1 week before the hearing.  Peer Review      In accordance with our policy published on July 1, 1994 (59 FR  34270), we will solicit the expert opinions of at least three  appropriate and independent specialists regarding the proposed rule.  The purpose of such review is to ensure listing decisions are based on  scientifically sound data, assumptions, and analyses. We will send  these peer reviewers copies of this proposed rule immediately following  publication in the Federal Register. We will invite these peer  reviewers to comment, during the public comment period, on the specific  assumptions and conclusions regarding the proposed listing and special  rule.  Executive Order 12866      Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to write regulations that  are easy to understand. We invite your comments on how to make this  proposal  [[Page 28669]]  easier to understand, including answers to questions such as the  following--(1) Is the discussion in the ``Supplementary Information''  section of the preamble helpful in understanding the proposal? (2) Does  the proposal contain technical language or jargon that interferes with  its clarity? (3) Does the format of the proposal (grouping and order of  sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce its  clarity? What else could we do to make the proposal easier to  understand?  Required Determinations  Paperwork Reduction Act      This rule does not contain any information collection requirements  for which Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the  Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), is required. Any  information collection related to the rule pertaining to permits for  endangered and threatened species has OMB approval and is assigned  clearance number 1018-0094. This rule does not alter that information  collection requirement. For additional information concerning permit  and associated requirements for threatened species, see 50 CFR 17.32.  Executive Order 13211      On May 18, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13211 on  regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and  use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of  Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. This rule is not  expected to significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use.  Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action, and no  Statement of Energy Effects is required.  National Environmental Policy Act      We have determined that an Environmental Assessment and  Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in  connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the  Endangered Species Act as amended. We published a notice outlining our  reasons for this determination in the Federal Register on October 25,  1983 (48 FR 49244).  Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes      In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994,  ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal  Governments'' (59 FR 22951) and 512 DM 2, we readily acknowledge our  responsibility to communicate meaningfully with recognized Federal  Tribes on a government-to-government basis. We will discuss this  proposal with potentially affected Tribes before we make a final  listing determination.

ACTION: Notice of availability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY:  Soulen Livestock, Inc.  (Soulen Livestock) has applied to the  Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an enhancement of survival  permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of  1973, as amended. The permit application includes a proposed Southern  Idaho Ground Squirrel Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances  (Agreement) between Soulen Livestock, the Service, the Idaho Department  of Fish and Game, and the Idaho Governor's Office of Species  Conservation.     Under the proposed Agreement, the parties would implement  conservation measures for southern Idaho ground squirrels (Spermophilus  brunneus endemicus) over approximately 43,145 acres of Soulen  Livestock's land in Washington and Payette Counties, western Idaho. The  intent of the Agreement is to conserve southern Idaho ground squirrels  by protecting and enhancing ground squirrel habitat and populations,  and reintroducing ground squirrels into currently unoccupied suitable  habitat, in a manner that is consistent with Soulen Livestock's farming  and ranching operations. The proposed term of the Agreement and the  permit is 20 years. The Service has prepared an Environmental  Assessment for approval of the Agreement and issuance of the permit.     We request comments from the public on the permit application,  Agreement, and the Environmental Assessment. All comments we receive,  including names and addresses, will become part of the administrative  record and may be released to the public.  DATES: Written comments should be received on or before April 22, 2002.  ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Dennis Mackey, Project  Biologist, Fish and Wildlife Service, 1387 S. Vinnell Way, Room 368,  Boise, Idaho 83709, (facsimile: 208/378-5262).  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dennis Mackey at the above address or  telephone 208/378-5267.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Document Availability      You may obtain copies of the documents for review by contacting the  individual named above. You also may make an appointment to view the  documents at the above address during normal business hours.  Background      Under a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances,  participating landowners voluntarily implement conservation activities  on their property to benefit unlisted species that are proposed or  candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act, or other  sensitive species. Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances  encourage private and other non-Federal property owners to implement  conservation efforts, and reduce threats to unlisted species by  assuring landowners that they will not be subjected to increased  property use restrictions, beyond those identified in the agreement, if  the species is listed in the future under the Endangered Species Act.  Application requirements and issuance criteria for enhancement of  survival permits through Candidate Conservation Agreements with  Assurances are found in 50 CFR 17.22(d) and 17.32(d).     On October 30, 2001, the Service formally identified the southern  Idaho ground squirrel as a candidate for listing under the Endangered  Species Act (66 FR 54807). Southern Idaho ground squirrels are  currently found within an approximately 518,000-acre area comprised of  lower elevation shrub/steppe habitat in the Weiser River Basin, in  southwest, Idaho. The species appears to have undergone a substantial  population decline throughout its range since 1985. Southern Idaho  ground squirrels are largely dependent on private lands: 85 percent of  the occupied ground squirrel sites are located on private lands, mostly  ranches and farms; 12 percent are under federal management by the  Bureau of Land Management; and 3 percent of the sites are on lands  managed by the Idaho Department of Lands. Conservation measures  implemented on private lands are important for the long-term survival  of the species.     Landowners may be willing to implement measures that enhance  populations of sensitive species on their property, but reluctant to do  so because of potential land-use restrictions that could occur should  the species eventually be listed under the Endangered Species Act. As a  result of this potential regulatory concern, Soulen Livestock developed  the Southern Idaho Ground Squirrel Candidate Conservation Agreement  with Assurances, in cooperation with the agencies, and is applying to  the Service for a permit under section 10(a) of the Endangered Species  Act, authorizing incidental take of southern Idaho ground squirrels.     Under the proposed Agreement and permit, Soulen Livestock and the  agencies would implement various conservation measures over the 43,145  acres of Soulen Livestock's property depending on present and future  occupancy of sites by southern Idaho ground squirrels and the location  of ground squirrel reintroduction/translocation sites. The proposed  conservation measures can be described in three categories: (1)  Measures to be applied on all 43,145 acres; (2) measures that would  occur on currently occupied ground squirrel sites (30 acres); and (3)  measures on 43,115 acres where ground squirrel occupancy and habitat  suitability is currently unknown. On all 43,145 acres of enrolled  lands, Soulen Livestock would not authorize the shooting, trapping, or  poisoning of southern Idaho ground squirrels and would allow agency  personnel access to these lands to conduct ground squirrel surveys.  Currently, three sites, covering 30 acres have been identified in the  site-specific plan as occupied by southern Idaho ground squirrels and  specific conservation measures have been identified at these sites to  protect ground squirrels from activities that may have adverse affects  to individual ground squirrels or their habitat. The ground squirrel  conservation measures on the 30 acres include: (1) Continue  reintroduction efforts, (2) monitor ground squirrel populations and  habitat characteristics to identify habitat enhancement/rehabilitation  measures; (3) implement habitat enhancement measures such as seeding  native or non-native vegetation species, fertilizing vegetation,  prescribed burning, and providing escape cover; (4) minimize direct  mortality from ground disturbing activities; (5) provide supplemental  feeding, if necessary; (6) prohibit shooting, trapping, or poisoning of  ground squirrels; and (7) control Columbian ground squirrels and  badgers. Columbian ground squirrels compete with southern Idaho ground  squirrels for food and burrow sites. Badgers can cause severe impacts  on prey species, especially if they are at critically low numbers. The  remaining  [[Page 13190]]  43,115 acres have not been surveyed for ground squirrel occupancy, and  no site-specific conservation measures have been identified on these  lands. On these unsurveyed lands, both individual ground squirrels and  their habitat will be protected from land use activities that may have  adverse effects at any sites identified in the future as occupied by  southern Idaho ground squirrels, or sites identified by the agencies as  reintroduction/translocation sites. The permit would authorize  incidental take of southern Idaho ground squirrels as a result of  Soulen Livestock's land use activities: crop cultivation and  harvesting, livestock grazing and production, farm equipment operation,  and recreational activities.     We provide this notice pursuant to section 10(c) of the Endangered  Species Act and implementing regulations for the National Environmental  Policy Act (40 CFR 1506.6). We will evaluate the permit application,  associated documents, and comments submitted thereon to determine  whether the permit application meets the requirements of section 10(a)  of the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act  regulations. If we determine that the requirements are met, we will  sign the Agreement and issue an enhancement of survival permit under  section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act to Soulen Livestock  for take of southern Idaho ground squirrels incidental to otherwise  lawful activities in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. We  will not make our final decision until after the end of the 30-day  comment period and will fully consider all comments received during the  comment period.      Dated: March 1, 2002. Rowan W.

GX102-55-9038152	Fox squirrel ( Sciurus niger )    The fox squirrel ( Sciurus niger ) is a demand management indicator species.    It has a small game status, is of economic importance and prefers upland hardwood, hardwood-pine and pine sites containing mature and overmature trees with some decadent stems and cavities (USDA Forest Service. 1990a)            Data Sources:    Acres of mature hardwood, hardwood – pine, and pine habitat equal to or greater than 40 years of age from the CISC data base, and habitat capability predictions using CompPATS (Appendix I) are data sources used to evaluate habitat capability trends over time.            Research data have determined the expected squirrel densities in habitat types.    Jordan (1971) in an oak-hickory habitat found up to 3.5 fox squirrels per acre and Nixon et al. (1974) had a mean squirrel density of 1.5 squirrels per acre.    Uhlig (1956) in his study of gray and fox squirrels found up to 141 squirrels per 100 acres and Huntley (1982) reported up to 89 squirrels per 100 acres.    Hedrick (1973) reported that squirrel numbers are directly related to the percent overstory cover of oaks and hickories.    Williamson, (1983) found that squirrel abundance was significantly correlated with basal area, tree density, and number of oaks per hectare.    Bouffard and Hein (1978) evaluated 6 counting methods and concluded none were satisfactory for extensive application in squirrel management.    Healy and Welch (1992) found squirrel numbers could vary almost 15 fold during a 5-year period within the same unchanged squirrel habitat.            The habitat capability modeling goes further than just the expected squirrel densities in a habitat type, by assessing the positive and negative impacts of land treatment on the habitat and species.    For example, Alexander (1979) indicated that fire could be detrimental in forest managed for squirrels.    In the habitat capability model, prescribed fire is assessed a negative coefficient to indicate this.    Because habitat relationships and the effects of management are well documented in the literature, using habitat capability models is a reasonable approach to monitoring fox squirrels.         Habitat Capability Over Time         Data on habitat capability for squirrels show an increasing habitat capability trend over time (Figure 4.16).    Data from the Continuous Inventory of Stand Conditions (CISC) also show an increasing trend for fox squirrel habitat over time (Figure 4.17).    With the aging of younger stands and the increasing acres of mature and over mature hardwood, hardwood – pine, and pine habitats, this trend should continue.              Figure 4.16—Squirrel habitat capability, Ouachita National Forest        Figure 4.17—Hardwood and hardwood – pine > 40 years         Interpretation of Trends:    Habitat capability and the acres of habitat for the fox squirrel are on an upward trend.    The fox squirrel is doing well throughout its range and its viability on the Forest is not threatened.            Implications for Management:    The fox squirrel is common, and has an increasing habitat capability trend.    The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation consider this species secure enough, that both agencies have stopped collecting hunter bag check and species survey data.    The major habitats provided for this species, have limited management activities that have a potential to create significant changes to the status quo.

ACTION: Notice of 12-month petition finding.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12- month finding for a petition to list the Big Cypress fox squirrel  (Sciurus niger avicennia) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  amended (Act). After a review of all available scientific and  commercial information, we find that listing of the Big Cypress fox  squirrel is not warranted at this time. We will continue to seek new  information on the biology, ecology, distribution, and habitat of the  Big Cypress fox squirrel, as well as potential threats to its continued  existence. If additional data become available in the future, we may  reassess the need for listing.  DATES: The finding announced in this document was made on February 15,  2002.  ADDRESSES: The complete file for this finding, including comments and  information submitted, is available for public inspection, by  appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, South Florida Ecological Services Office, 1339 20th Street,  Vero Beach, FL 32960.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Martin (see ADDRESSES section;  telephone 561/562-3909 extension 230; facsimile 561/562-4288).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that, for any petition to  revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that  presents substantial scientific and commercial information, we must  make a finding within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition  as to whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b)  warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded from immediate proposal by  other pending proposals of higher priority. Upon making a 12-month  finding, we must promptly publish notice of such finding in the Federal  Register.     The Big Cypress fox squirrel (Sciurus niger avicennia) is a  subspecies of the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), which occurs over most  of the eastern and central United States, extending into south-central  Canada (Koprowski 1994). The Big Cypress fox squirrel is restricted to  southwest Florida. Its historic range was southwest Florida from south  of the Caloosahatchee River, west of the Everglades, to as far south as  Cape Sable (Williams and Humphrey 1979, Moore 1956). Despite human  development and changes in land use in the southwestern Florida  peninsula, the current range of the Big Cypress fox squirrel, based on  its description in the best available information, is essentially  unchanged (Humphrey and Jodice 1992, Williams and Humphrey 1979, and  Moore 1956). Big Cypress fox squirrels have been reported present in  Hendry and Lee Counties south of the Caloosahatchee River, Collier  County, the mainland of Monroe County, and extreme western Miami-Dade  County (a strip of land on the western side of the true Everglades,  largely in Big Cypress National Preserve) (Humphrey and Jodice 1992,  Jodice 1990, Wooding 1990, and Williams and Humphrey 1979). The Big  Cypress fox squirrel is, however, absent from a few areas of its  historic range like the Cape Sable coast of Everglades National Park in  the vicinity of Flamingo, Monroe County. (Wooding 1990, Jodice 1990,  Humphrey and Jodice 1992).     Fox squirrel research specific to Florida was only begun in the  1950s (Wooding 1990). Therefore, very little information regarding Big  Cypress fox squirrels is available from prior to that time. Studies of  the Big Cypress fox squirrel in its natural habitat are virtually  nonexistent. Available reports specific to the Big Cypress fox squirrel  provide limited details regarding the biology of, population status of,  and threats faced by this fox squirrel range-wide. In addition, no  recent studies or evaluations of the Big Cypress fox squirrel have been  conducted. The only recent analysis was conducted on potential Big  Cypress fox squirrel habitat (WilsonMiller Inc. 2002). The previous  range-wide report by Cox et al. (1994) on habitat used 1985-1989  Landsat imagery.     The State has protected the Big Cypress fox squirrel since 1973,  when the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Commission) listed it as  endangered. The State reclassified the Big Cypress fox squirrel to  threatened in 1979; the species retained protection as a nongame  species. As a threatened species, Big Cypress fox squirrels and their  nests cannot be taken or possessed without authorization from the  Commission.     Our involvement with the Big Cypress fox squirrel began when we  identified the Big Cypress fox squirrel as a category 2 candidate  species in Notices of Review published in the Federal Register on  December 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454), September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37958),  January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), and  November 15, 1994 (59 FR 58982). Prior to 1996, a category 2 species  was one that we were considering for possible addition to the Federal  Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants, but for which  conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats were not  available to support a proposed rule. We identified the Big Cypress fox  squirrel's status as ``D'' or ``Declining'' in the 1991 and 1994  Notices of Review. This designation indicates decreasing numbers or  increasing threats. In addition, we identified a priority for this  subspecies and most of our other category 2 candidates during the  completion of the 1991 and 1994 Notices of Review. In 1991, the Big  Cypress fox squirrel was identified as a priority 9. Based on the  listing priority system detailed in the Federal Register in 1983 (48 FR  43103), this priority indicated that the Big Cypress fox squirrel faced  a moderate to low magnitude of imminent threats. In  [[Page 8500]]  1994, the Big Cypress fox squirrel was identified as a low-priority  category 2 candidate. We discontinued designation of category 2 species  in the February 28, 1996, Notice of Review (61 FR 7596). This notice  redefined candidate to include only species for which we have  information needed to propose them for listing.     On January 5, 1998, we received a petition from the Biodiversity  Legal Foundation, Sidney Maddock, Florida Biodiversity Project, Brian  Scherf, and Rosalyn Scherf, to list the Big Cypress fox squirrel as a  threatened species and designate critical habitat concurrently with  listing. The petitioners stated that the Big Cypress fox squirrel is  threatened by several factors, including habitat loss, fragmentation,  and modification; exclusion of fire; predation; road mortality; and  poaching. After considering the petition and reviewing all available  scientific and commercial information, we made a 90-day finding that  the petition to list the Big Cypress fox squirrel presented substantial  information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. We  published a notice announcing our finding in the Federal Register on  September 9, 1998 (63 FR 48165), and initiated a status review on the  subspecies.     On December 11, 2000, the petitioners  filed  a complaint in the U.S.  District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Key West Division,  against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), the Director of  the Service, and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior,  alleging the Service failed to make a 12-month finding on the petition  to list the Big Cypress fox squirrel. On September 25, 2001, the U.S.  Department of Justice entered into a settlement agreement with the  petitioners in which the Service agreed to complete a 12-month finding  for the Big Cypress fox squirrel and submit this finding to the Federal  Register by February 18, 2002.  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      Under Section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may be determined to be  threatened or endangered for any one of the following reasons: (1)  Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of  habitat or range; (2) overutilization for commercial, sporting,  scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4)  inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or  manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Listing  determinations are made solely on the best scientific and commercial  data available and after taking into account any efforts being made by  any State or foreign nation to protect the species. We have examined  each of the five listing factors under the Act for their application to  the Big Cypress fox squirrel as follows:     1. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or  curtailment of its habitat or range. The Big Cypress fox squirrel's  current range, as described in the best available information, remains  essentially unchanged (Humphrey and Jodice 1992, Williams and Humphrey  1979, Moore 1956) from its historic range. This subspecies of fox  squirrel has been found to use most types of forests within its range,  including open pinelands (wet or dry), mixed open pine-cypress, mixed  open pine hardwoods, open hardwood, seasonally used cypress strand and  edges of cypress dome strands, interiors of cypress domes and strands,  prairie with interspersed pines or adjacent pineland, live oak  savannas, and mangrove, cypress, and hardwood swamps. Although many  questions remain about habitat use and requirements for this squirrel,  the Big Cypress fox squirrel seems to prefer an open understory in the  habitat types that it frequents (Ditigen 1999, Wooding 1990, and Brown  1978). We also believe the Big Cypress fox squirrel is opportunistic in  its use of available habitat. For example, in addition to the habitat  types listed above, Big Cypress fox squirrels also persist in urban  settings where native vegetation is present (Ditigen 1999, Cox et al.  1994, and Williams and Humphrey 1979). These settings include golf  courses, city parks, and residential areas that contain or have  adjacent pine flatwoods, upland fringes of cypress domes, and tropical  hardwood forests.     Habitat for the Big Cypress fox squirrel exists on both private  land and conservation lands within this subspecies' range. We provide a  brief county-by-county analysis:  Hendry County      The land ownership is mostly private and land use is mainly  agriculture and ranching. Most Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat is in  the northwestern part of the county on several ranches. These areas are  all medium-sized (1,000-4,000 ha) with existing Big Cypress fox  squirrel populations (Wooding 1997). Fox squirrels use both pine and  cypress habitats, as well as improved cattle pastures that have live  oaks, on ranchlands in Hendry County (Williams and Humphrey 1979).  Okaloacoochee Slough State Forest is also in this county. The rate of  population growth for Hendry County as estimated and projected  gradually decreases between 1990 and 2030. (For all human population  figures, 1990 and 2000 figures from U.S. Census, available at  http:// swfloridabusiness.com ; ``Projections of Florida Population by County,  2000-2030,'' produced by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research,  University of Florida. Data presented at website of Southwest Florida  Regional Planning Council (see Literature Cited)).  Lee County      In eastern Lee County, land ownership is similar to Hendry County.  A notable Big Cypress fox squirrel population in a medium-sized area of  habitat was found on a ranch in this part of the county (Wooding 1997).  Wooding also reported Big Cypress fox squirrels from golf courses and  ranchettes adjacent to this area. Western Lee County is mostly urban or  residential in and near Ft. Myers and Naples, including the corridor of  I-75. However, areas of habitat that Big Cypress fox squirrels use  exist in this area, like Estero Bay State Buffer Preserve and Koreshan  State Historic Site. Lee County, between 2000 and 2010, will gain the  greatest number of people (98,412) of all the counties within the range  of the Big Cypress fox squirrel. We expect this population growth will  be focused around the I-75 corridor.  Collier County      The northwestern edge of Collier County is similar to western Lee  County, with mostly urban or residential areas in and near the Naples  area and the end of the I-75 corridor. We expect population growth in  the county to be focused in this area. Wooding (1997) found Big Cypress  fox squirrels to be common on some golf courses around Naples. In  addition, Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, which has  reported fox squirrels (Florida Department of Environmental Protection  2001a), is in this area. The remainder of Collier County to the south  and east is mostly in public ownership as conservation lands. Big  Cypress fox squirrels have been reported from all conservation lands in  this county and one ranch.  Monroe and Miami-Dade Counties      Monroe County and extreme western Miami-Dade County are largely  composed of Everglades National Park, where the squirrel is a resident  and can be found in mangroves, pinelands, and cypress swamp ( http:// www.nps.gov/ever/eco/mammals.htm ). We believe that residential and  urban land uses in  [[Page 8501]]  this part of the Big Cypress fox squirrel's range are insignificant.  Summary      Within the geographic range of the Big Cypress fox squirrel, 58  percent of the potential habitat for this subspecies exists in  conservation lands (551,855 ac) and a little under 400,000 ac exists on  nonconservation lands, for a total of 949,000 ac (WilsonMiller Inc.  2002). Big Cypress fox squirrels occur in nearly all conservation lands  within their range.     Recently, WilsonMiller Inc. (2002) evaluated the amount of  potential habitat available to the Big Cypress fox squirrel in  southwest Florida, especially in Collier, Hendry, Lee, and Monroe  counties. It noted that the basis of Cox et al.'s (1994) report,  especially their choice to use pineland and dry prairie as the  principal components of Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat and their  subsequent analysis based on these cover types, was inconsistent with  Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat types described in current literature  (Humphrey and Jodice 1992), did not fully account for the occurrence  data reported by Williams and Humphrey 1979, and underestimated the  total amount of Big Cypress fox squirrel potential habitat. In its  analysis, WilsonMiller Inc. used 1995 data to map, with a minimum map  unit size of 5 acres, habitat types utilized by the fox squirrel and  consistent with Humphrey and Jodice (1992). The mapped results indicate  that more than twice as much Big Cypress fox squirrel potential habitat  (949,000 ac) exists than what was estimated by Cox et al. (about  414,000 ac). The WilsonMiller Inc. map also indicates large,  interconnected, forested patches of Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat  that may allow movement and genetic interchange. According to  WilsonMiller Inc., its analysis and map correlates well with available  occurrence data for the Big Cypress fox squirrel and includes  conservation lands with known Big Cypress fox squirrel residents and  habitat that was not accounted for by Cox et al. (1994).     In general, we believe--based on WilsonMiller Inc's (2002) study-- that the Big Cypress fox squirrel has more potential habitat than  outlined by Cox et al. (1994) (over 900,000 acres) and has additional  larger patches of habitat than those classified by Wooding (1997). We  also believe similar to Wooding (1997) that smaller, isolated,  fragmented pockets of squirrels are surviving in strips and patches of  habitat, such as golf courses and fringes of residential areas. We  believe the Big Cypress fox squirrel has been difficult to assess in  its range. Among other reasons, native fox squirrel habitat is often  too dense to make behavioral observations (or sightings) from farther  away than a few meters. (Maehr 1993)     We believe the majority of population growth in the Big Cypress fox  squirrel's range will occur in or near the I-75 corridor, mostly in and  around the south Ft. Myers and Naples areas. Growth and development  will generally occur west of the majority of Big Cypress fox squirrel  potential habitat (WilsonMiller Inc. 2002). Habitat important to the  Big Cypress fox squirrel in this area is under the greatest pressure to  be developed for residential or commercial purposes. The highest  density of roads in the Big Cypress fox squirrel's range occurs in this  area. Roads, depending on the type, level of traffic, and location, may  fragment Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat or hinder squirrel movement.  However, no research has been conducted to determine to what degree  roads may fragment squirrel habitat or hinder squirrel movement. We  cannot conclude based on current information if road fragmentation  constitutes a threat to this subspecies' habitat. Based on recorded  sightings, we do believe squirrels cross some roads and are found near  them. An area around the I-75 corridor that has been heavily studied  includes golf courses, which have been found to provide a better green  space than most development projects, but Big Cypress fox squirrels  will persist on them only as long as suitable native habitat is  contiguous to the golf courses (Ditigen 1999).     A large portion of the Big Cypress fox squirrel's range consists of  lands purchased for conservation purposes. These lands are mostly in  Collier, Monroe, and extreme western Miami-Dade Counties and are  protected from development and have a low density of roads bisecting  natural habitat. Our available information does not conclusively  suggest that current management practices on these conservation lands  constitute a threat to the Big Cypress fox squirrel. For example,  Humphrey and Jodice (1992) explain that ground fires apparently are  valuable to the habitats of Big Cypress fox squirrels because they slow  plant succession, but this specific relationship has not been studied.  We are encouraged by the efforts of both State and Federal agencies in  fire planning and prescribed burning. This should result in a more open  understory for the Big Cypress fox squirrel if burning is not hampered  by drought conditions for continuous years.     Hendry County and eastern Lee County, where Wooding (1997) found  the largest areas of Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat and where  WilsonMiller Inc. (2002) found only 10 percent of the total potential  Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat, are under private ownership and are  not under high pressure to be developed for residential purposes  (though native Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat here may be converted  for different land uses, such as citrus production). Big Cypress fox  squirrels have been reported to occur on ranches. In fact, much of the  habitat described by Wooding (1997) is on ranches in southern Florida,  and grazing by cattle may enhance the understory, improving the habitat  for squirrels (Williams and Humphrey 1979). Even if we assume that Big  Cypress fox squirrels are not able to use lands converted for citrus  production or other agricultural purposes, the best available  information does not indicate that the rate of conversion of native  habitat in Hendry County poses a threat to this subspecies. According  to WilsonMiller (2002), Collier, Lee, and Monroe counties, which  contain 90 percent of the total Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat,  nearly all of which is in conservation lands, have not undergone a  significant agricultural expansion. Therefore, we also cannot conclude,  based on the best available information, that the rate of land  conversion in these counties poses a threat to this subspecies.     Mining for rock and sand also occurs in Collier and Lee Counties.  Some of these operations destroy pine flatwoods or mixed pine-cypress  areas. In some cases, it may be difficult to separate losses to mining  from those due to agriculture, because lands are often cleared under  agricultural permits prior to mining. Mines are an allowed use in  agriculturally zoned areas in Lee and Collier Counties (K. Dryden and  A. Eller, Fish and Wildlife Service, personal communication 2000).  Mining is not a compatible land use if it destroys native squirrel  habitat.     Our best available information indicates the Big Cypress fox  squirrel has lost habitat in some areas to urbanization, agriculture,  and mining. Nevertheless, conservation lands do cover 58 percent of  this subspecies' historic range, and areas of habitat exist on private  ranches and other urban areas. Based on the best available information,  potential Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat appears to be more than  twice what was previously estimated. In addition, the Big Cypress fox  squirrel still occupies most of its historic range in southwest Florida  and has shown itself to be adaptable, by residing in  [[Page 8502]]  altered habitats such as golf courses and residential areas where  native habitat is preserved, and mobile in its native habitat.  Furthermore, quantitative or substantial information on the Big Cypress  fox squirrel, its status, and its habitat use and requirements is  lacking. Therefore, based on uncertainties about how this fox squirrel  uses its native habitat and on the actual status of the Big Cypress fox  squirrel population, and due to the amount of available potential  habitat to this fox squirrel, we cannot conclude that the Big Cypress  fox squirrel is threatened or endangered due to the destruction or  curtailment of its habitat or range.     2. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or  educational purposes. The Big Cypress fox squirrel has been protected  from hunting since 1973, when the State listed it as an endangered  species. The State later reclassified the Big Cypress fox squirrel to  threatened in 1979, but it retained protection as a nongame species.  Elsewhere in Florida, fox squirrel hunting formerly was a popular  activity, but interest dropped off (Wooding 1990), which is one factor  that led to the closure of fox squirrel hunting statewide as of the  1996-1997 hunting season (Wooding 1997). Despite concerns that ``people  were still shooting'' fox squirrels as discussed in the petition, we do  not have evidence that poaching of fox squirrels constitutes a threat  to this subspecies. Also, no information is available to confirm that  Big Cypress fox squirrel populations may have suffered long-term  reduction in size due to legal hunting.     3. Disease or predation. A skin fungus has been identified as a  source of mortality for Big Cypress fox squirrels found in urban areas.  During Ditgen's (1999) study of fox squirrels on golf courses in  southwest Florida, she noted at least eight individuals with a fungus  causing heavy fur loss and a blackened crusting of the skin. Ditgen  reported that two Big Cypress fox squirrels died as a result of the  skin fungus during her study. One collared individual survived the  fungus infestation and regained a thick, healthy coat. No researchers  have suggested that this fungus threatens urban Big Cypress fox  squirrel populations. A pox outbreak was reported in eight counties in  southeast and central Florida outside the range of the Big Cypress fox  squirrel during the 1990's. Although no cases have been reported  affecting Big Cypress fox squirrels, one infected Sherman's fox  squirrel was observed (T. Regen, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation  Commission, personal communication 1999). Mosquitoes transmit the  disease, which only affects squirrels. No known treatment or vaccine is  available. At this time, we have no evidence that pox is likely to pose  a threat to the Big Cypress fox squirrel. In addition, Big Cypress fox  squirrels, like other fox squirrels, are susceptible to parasites, but  we have no evidence that parasites pose a threat to the Big Cypress fox  squirrel. As the petitioners state, based on a study of fox squirrel  parasites, the prevalences and intensities were much lower in Big  Cypress fox squirrels.     Predation may limit the sizes of Big Cypress fox squirrel  populations. All fox squirrels spend much of their time on the ground,  where they are more vulnerable to predation than when in trees  (Humphrey and Jodice 1992). Known predators of Big Cypress fox  squirrels include bobcats (Felis rufus), gray and red foxes (Vulpes  vulpes), and domestic cats (Felis sylvestris) (Ditgen 1999). Small  mammals are inherently subject to predation. However, the best  available information does not lead us to the conclusion that disease  or predation has caused the species to meet the definition of  threatened or endangered.     4. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. The Big Cypress  fox squirrel is listed as threatened by the Florida Fish and Wildlife  Conservation Commission (Commission) under Rule 68A-27.004 (formerly  39-27.004) of the Florida Administrative Code. This rule provides that  no one may take, possess, transport, molest, harass, or sell any  threatened species, their parts, or their nests except as authorized by  a permit from the Commission. Permits are issued for conservation  purposes or scientific purposes only after the applicant shows the  activity will not have a negative impact on the survival of the  threatened species. The Commission typically has not authorized the  take of animals, but does authorize take of nest trees and nests  outside of nesting season when the nest is not active (J. Beever,  Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, personal  communication 2000). The Commission also provides technical assistance  and recommendations to other government agencies that regulate  development activities in the Big Cypress fox squirrel range. According  to Section 372.0725 of the Florida Statutes, it is unlawful for anyone  to kill or wound a Big Cypress fox squirrel or to intentionally destroy  the nest of a Big Cypress fox squirrel, except as provided for in the  rules by the Commission. Most other State agencies have not promulgated  specific regulations to protect this or other animals, but instead help  enforce the Commission's regulatory protections for wildlife. On many  State lands managed by agencies other than the Commission, the hunting  season, including permits, is managed by the Commission under its  Wildlife Management Area program. Such properties include Picayune  Strand and Okaloacoochee State Forests. On these properties, the  Commission has the lead responsibility for activities that involve the  take of wildlife.     Under the Environmental Resources Permitting program (ERP)  implemented by the South Florida Water Management District (SFLWMD),  Big Cypress fox squirrels and Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat on  private lands receive protection. The Big Cypress fox squirrel has been  designated under this program as an aquatic or wetland-dependent  species that uses upland habitat for nesting. In order to get a permit  from SFLWMD to begin an activity, like converting land for agricultural  purposes, the landowner must provide assurances that the activity will  not adversely impact the value of wetlands and other surface waters for  Big Cypress fox squirrels, the value of uplands for nesting (foraging  areas or wildlife corridors are not included), and will not cause  adverse secondary impacts to the Big Cypress fox squirrel. (Basis of  Review for ERP applications, January 2001, as referenced in Chapter  40E-4, Florida Administrative Code). As such, its upland nest and  wetland areas receive consideration during the wetland permitting  review. Projects where this subspecies or its habitat have been  observed through surveys are required to preserve onsite habitat,  implement a Big Cypress fox squirrel management plan, and minimize the  spread of exotic plants onsite.     On all properties under jurisdiction of the Florida Division of  Recreation and Parks, collection of specimens is allowed only by  permit. This includes Collier-Seminole State Park and Fakahatchee  Strand State Preserve Park. This prohibition is in addition to the  statewide prohibition of take of Big Cypress fox squirrels imposed by  the Commission. Other State land-managing agencies have similar  authority to regulate public access and to manage the vegetation and  other natural resources. Lands managed by the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection (FLDEP) are protected by State park  regulations. Also, Big Cypress fox squirrels and other resources on  Federal conservation lands are protected by rules imposed by land  management agencies, such as the National Park Service for Big Cypress  National Preserve, to generally protect resources. In both cases, use  of motor vehicles is  [[Page 8503]]  regulated or restricted, and take of Big Cypress fox squirrels is  prohibited.     Substantial areas of Big Cypress fox squirrel habitat are on  conservation lands or on private lands not currently threatened by  development. Regulatory mechanisms exist that prevent direct take, and  ERP rules provide some protection to the species' habitat. Therefore,  the available information does not lead us to conclude that the species  is threatened or endangered due to inadequacy of existing regulatory  mechanisms.     5. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued  existence. Fox squirrel reproduction varies greatly from year to year  in response to food supplies. There are few data on how Big Cypress fox  squirrels utilize their native habitats and on how many squirrels exist  in these habitats. Based on the best available information, we do not  believe that food availability is currently a threat that could lead  the fox squirrel toward extinction.     Based on current information and recorded sightings, we believe Big  Cypress fox squirrels cross roads and are found near them. Road  mortality is documented for the Big Cypress fox squirrel, but a very  large portion of this subspecies' habitat has few, if any roads, so  road mortality in these areas is likely to be minimal. While road  mortality may cause declines in numbers of squirrels in certain urban  areas or other areas with roads, in the absence of demographic data, we  have no evidence that the subspecies is threatened by road mortality.     No studies have documented the effects of pesticides on Big Cypress  fox squirrels, and we have no evidence that poisoning is a major cause  of mortality for big Cypress fox squirrels on golf courses. Poisoning  has not been documented sufficiently for us to consider it a threat to  the continued existence of the species.     Hurricanes in 1935 (Labor Day), 1960 (Donna), and 1992 (Andrew)  extensively damaged squirrel habitat (Moore 1956, Brown 1971). The 1960  hurricane toppled nearly all the suitable nesting trees in Everglades  City and virtually eliminated a Big Cypress fox squirrel population  that inhabited a public park (Brown 1971, Humphrey and Jodice 1992).  None of the three catastrophic hurricanes since 1930 impacted more than  a fraction of the squirrel's range. The range of the subspecies is  large enough to ensure that catastrophic hurricane damage is unlikely  throughout the range in any 1 year. The Big Cypress fox squirrel and  other southeastern fox squirrel subspecies have evolved under  conditions of periodic hurricane disturbances, the most important of  which for fox squirrels is probably large-scale destruction of trees.  Therefore, we do not believe that hurricanes are a threat to the  continued existence of the Big Cypress fox squirrel.  Finding      We have reviewed the petition, the literature cited in the  petition, other available literature and information, and consulted  with species experts and other individuals familiar with the Big  Cypress fox squirrel. On the basis of the best available scientific and  commercial information, we find that the petitioned action is not  warranted at this time. The status review revealed a lack of reliable  data and information on the current status and any trend in density and  abundance of Big Cypress fox squirrels in natural or seminatural  habitats over time. In particular, we have no reliable information on  the sizes of Big Cypress fox squirrel populations on conservation lands  or private lands in southwest Florida, and the most recent information  on Big Cypress fox squirrels on privately owned ranches in Lee and  Hendry Counties is from a very brief survey conducted in 1989 (Wooding  1997). Studies as described in this finding and in our available  literature indicate the Big Cypress fox squirrel has lost habitat in  some areas to urbanization, agriculture, and mining. Nevertheless,  conservation lands cover 58 percent of this subspecies' historic range,  and areas of habitat exist on private ranches and other urban areas.     Based on the best available information, potential Big Cypress fox  squirrel habitat appears to be more than twice what was previously  estimated. In addition, the Big Cypress fox squirrel still occupies  most of its historic range in southwest Florida and has shown itself to  be adaptable, by residing in altered habitats such as golf courses and  residential areas where native habitat is preserved, and mobile in its  native habitat. Furthermore, quantitative or substantial information on  the Big Cypress fox squirrel, its status, and its habitat use and  requirements is lacking. Therefore, based on uncertainties about how  this fox squirrel uses its native habitat and on the actual status of  the Big Cypress fox squirrel population, and due to the amount of  available potential habitat to this fox squirrel, we cannot conclude  that the Big Cypress fox squirrel is threatened or endangered due to  the destruction or curtailment of its habitat or range.     We found no evidence that the species is threatened by  overutilization for commercial, recreational, or educational purposes  (i.e., poaching), nor by disease or predation. We also have no data to  show that inadequacies in the existing regulatory mechanisms may  threaten the survival of the Big Cypress fox squirrel. Thus, we cannot  conclude that the Big Cypress fox squirrel qualifies for listing as an  endangered or threatened species due to any of the five factors as  defined in the Act. Because the available information does not  demonstrate that the Big Cypress fox squirrel meets the definition of  threatened or endangered, we find that listing the Big Cypress fox  squirrel (Sciurus niger avicennia) as threatened is not warranted at  the present time.

GX043-58-8472990	"Why Do We Hunt?                    W       atch a springer spaniel wriggle and squirm ecstatically as it's being led afield to nose up pheasants and you understand a little bit better what goes on inside human hunters as summer turns to fall.    We may not wriggle, but walking down a forest trail to a deer stand or wading in mud flats to set out a raft of decoys triggers in hunters irrepressible excitement and pleasure.    Going hunting is like quenching a thirst, scratching an itch. It seems to satisfy a deep, human need.    Hunting is basic to our natures. As long as people have populated earth they have taken the lives of other species to feed themselves.    In terms of human time, we've only recently domesticated animals; for most of our history, the meat people have eaten was taken from the carcasses of wild animals they captured and killed.    Social anthropologists maintain that our unique and complicated social organization and language evolved because coordination and communication were necessary to successfully hunt large and dangerous game.    Hunting may have also spurred our aesthetic impulses. Certainly, some of the first evidence we have of our species; artistic nature, manifested in the cave paintings of Lascaux, France, were stylized representations of animals and the human hunters that pursued them.    When human life and so many human qualities owe their existence to hunting, it seems preposterous that newly organized animal rights groups could claim hunting is inhuman.    Hunters needn't apologize for hunting. They follow their instinct and their part is clear and straightforward. Hunters allow no middlemen, salesmen, marketing experts, chefs or grocers to trick them into thinking their lives don't rely on the death of other animals. For hunters, the formula is as simple as nature herself: an animal is harvested to feed the hunter's family.    Nor is hunting cruel. Game animals aren't caged, fattened, bred, jam together or raised on production lines. They live in forests, clearings and wetlands, following the natural instincts of their species.    Some fall day, a hunter's bullet may end a wild animal's life. Animal rights activists often dwell on that exact moment, seeming to forget that death is the fate of all living things. A hunter's bullet is usually clean and quick. Good hunters insist on it.    Thanks to hunters' interest in maintaining sustainable populations of game animals and to many dollars generated for wildlife management through license sales and special taxes on hunting equipment, the number of deer, turkey, squirrel and other game species are stable or increasing. Other species, such as the giant Canada goose, have been brought back from the brink of extinction.    Regulated hunting seasons and bag limits keep animal populations in check and prevent a repeating boom and bust cycle of overabundance followed by disease and mass starvation.                                                        Hunters     allow no middlemen, salesmen, marketing experts, chefs or grocers     to trick them into thinking their lives don't rely on the death     of other animals.                                              Hunting also brings into balance those who go afield. Hunting rewards alertness, patience, self-restraint. It demands stealth, keen vision, a knowledge of the quarry and its environment. Those who refuse to learn the ways of the woods are seldom successful.    It's true, hunters could buy their meat in sanitized, foam and plastic containers from the supermarkets, leaving the killing to others. By doing so, however, they'd sacrifice their sense of self-reliance, of individuality, of participation in the natural world.    ""If they only didn't seem to enjoy it so much,"" some people complain, as if hunting would be acceptable if it were dull, tedious work.    But hunting provides many pleasures, including lifelong companions, loyal and hard-working dogs, the earthy scents of linseed oil and decaying leaves.    Every bit of a hunt is somehow satisfyingplanning, scouting, packing sandwiches to eat on a downed log, driving in the darkness to reach a hunting stand before first light, listening to the forest awake, being startled by nearby snap of a twig...    And yes, a hunter who successfully brings down a swift, intelligent and graceful prey animal does experience happiness and pride.    If it were not forever so, humans wouldn't be on this planet today.   Tom Cwynar       Hunting is a great way to learn more about wildlife and nature and to carve your own personal niche in the cycle of life. Hunters don't just observe nature, we participate. We become immersed in the birds and animals we seek and constantly strive to learn more about them. We scout, plan, and anticipate. Hunting is also great fun. It's and outstanding way to forge strong bonds with family and friends.    Kathy Etling   Outdoor Writer       Hunting is one form of exercise that I truly enjoy...being in the woods...seeing everything in its natural state...breathing the fresh air...and watching my grandson's progress in his learning of the hunting skills. I also enjoy the feeling that I am helping nature keep things in balance, through the licenses and taxes I pay on supplies, which helps the Missouri Conservation Department do the great job it is doing.    Willis Corbett   Lobbyist       Hunting lets me escape urban trappings and reconnect with nature. I'm glad to have a season when I can leave plastic, concrete, car horns, computers, commercials and manipulating people behind and participate in the simple and stark world of predator vs. prey. Hunting requires and develops self-discipline, cunning and patience, talents I believe valuable, even in these modern times.    Tom Cwynar   Writer/Editor       Facts About Hunting        Safety    Statistics show there is only one accident for every 10,000 hunters.   In fact, of all the accidental deaths in 1987, only two percent   involved firearms, much less than drowning, suffocation and burns.   To further reduce hunting accidents, the Conservation Department   requires hunter safety training for everyone born on or after   January 1,1967. Over 500,000 Missourians have received hunter   safety certificates.    Stable wildlife populations    A healthy deer herd on suitable habitat can be reduced by as   much as 40 percent with no ill effect on populations; hunters   rarely take more than 15 percent. If not harvested, a deer herd   can double in size in only two years, quickly deplete available   food supplies and face certain starvation. Quail have an annual   mortality rate of 75 to 85 percent, whether they are hunted or   not.    Funds for all wildlife    Through license fees and taxes on equipment, hunters and anglers   contribute an average of $3 million  each day  to wildlife   conservation. Habitat improvement that benefits quail likewise   helps songbirds; land that's acquired or managed for deer or   turkey also provides homes for foxes, bobcats, other mammals   and many species of birds.

GX243-46-8557692	WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBE PO Box 700 Whiteriver, Arizona 85941  ______________________________________________________________________________ Contact: Chadeen Palmer, Public Information Officer 928-338-4346 x 373 928-338-4767 Fax  ***NEWS RELEASE***  Date: June 4, 2003 1:00 p.m. ______________________________________________________________________________  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: White Mountain Apache Tribe Releases Wolves on the Reservation [Whiteriver, Arizo na]--The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) is pleased to announce the first official Mexican Gray Wolf Release on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. The release is scheduled to take place by the end of June 2003. An Alpha pack and this year's pups will be set free in the Southeastern region of the reservation. The hope is that the pups will cause the pack to localize and set up a permanent territory. The release site has been chosen to minimize conflict with human impact, livestock, and other tribal land use. The White Mountain Apache Tribe is one of only two tribes in the southwest to officially cooperate in the recovery of the Mexican gray wolves. They are the second Native American tribe to develop a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and to create a successful management plan for wolf reintroduction. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated the Mexican wolf reintroduction program in 1998, and the tribe followed soon after. In 2000 the tribe adopted its own Mexican Wo lf Management plan, and hired a tribal wolf biologist in 2001. The tribe's goal is to return the wolf to its' traditional range on the reservation and to allow six packs to establish territories. The long- term goals include educational and tourism opportunities through the WMAT Wildlife and Outdoor Recreation Division program. Currently, the Reservation is home to the Bonito Creek Pair, one of the few naturally occurring, wild- bonded pair of wolves within the program.

The National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) functions as the research arm of WS by providing scientific information for the development of socially acceptable methods for wildlife damage management. As part of WS' strategic plan to improve the coexistence of people and wildlife, it has identified four goals: (1) Developing Methods, (2) Providing Wildlife Services, (3) Valuing and Investing in People, and (4) Information and Communication. WS is dedicated to helping meet the wildlife damage management needs of the United States by building on the unit's strengths in these four key areas. This annual NWRC Research Highlights is structured around these program goals. NWRC has 18 multiyear research projects to address the current needs of the program and its customers in these 4 areas.    New Laboratory and Office Building-- In January 1999, NWRC staff in Fort Collins, CO, moved from three temporary buildings into a new headquarters laboratory and office building, the NWRC Wildlife Services Building, located on 43 acres on the Foothills Research Campus of Colorado State University (CSU). The new building houses all NWRC staff in Fort Collins except for the Animal Care staff, who are located in the adjacent NWRC Animal Research Building (ARB). The combination laboratory and office building was constructed by a private developer and is leased to NWRC. The building comprises 71,000 ft 2  of space, including specialized laboratories for bird, mammal, product development, and chemistry research along with other unique spaces for the research library, record and tissue archives, a conference center, and office space for 100 NWRC staff, visiting scientists, and students.    The next phase of the master plan for this site also is under way. It includes construction of outdoor animal holding facilities and the ARB support wing. These facilities should be completed by the year 2000. Some additional construction will still be needed to complete the master plan.

Photo    Impacts of Canada Goose Movements on Aircraft at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage, AK-- Bird strikes to aircraft are a serious economic and safety problem in the United States, annually causing millions of dollars in damage to civilian and military aircraft and the occasional loss of human life. A significant military aircraft disaster caused by birds occurred in 1995 at Elmendorf Air Force Base (EAFB) in Anchorage, AK when an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft ingested several Canada geese on takeoff and crashed, killing 24 people. NWRC scientists have been helping to resolve these kinds of problems for several years.    During 1998, NWRC scientists identified geese that frequent EAFB, ascertained movement patterns of goose concentrations in the Anchorage area, identified goose feeding and loafing sites, obtained data on the relationship between their distance and movements onto EAFB, and determined the efficacy of goose translocation. With respect to evaluating translocation, 1,236 lesser Canada geese were fitted with coded plastic neck collars and observed between August and October 1997. These geese were collared at 16 molting sites located throughout the Anchorage area. EAFB dispersal teams and NWRC personnel observed 208 collared geese, at least once, inside the EAFB exclusion zone.    Twenty-six percent of the collared geese observed on EAFB had previously been translocated about 60 km away. Of these, 41 were observed more than once. In addition, 23 percent translocated to Anchorage International Airport and 38 percent translocated to Merrill Field Airport also returned multiple times following hazing.    These geese present a special hazard to aircraft safety because they appear to have become habituated to nonlethal scare tactics. In addition, collared geese first moved back to EAFB 30 to 40 days after capture, and the largest proportions return between 70 and 90 days after capture. Return rates of the other relocated geese ranged from 75 to 100 percent for adults, and 96 to 100 percent for juveniles. Translocations provided only short-term relief in reducing risks to aircraft safety.    Mesurol® and Flight Control® Show Promise in Reducing Horned Lark Damage to Lettuce Seedlings-- Lettuce   is an important economic crop in California, with approximately 77,000 ha in production and a value of $735 million in 1996. Bird damage to recently planted crops is a major problem in several of California's lettuce-producing areas, including the San Joaquin Valley, the central coast, and southern California. Annual losses due to bird damage at seedling emergence is estimated at $4.6 million. The bird species primarily responsible is the horned lark .  The current method used to reduce these losses is hazing by shooters, a method that provides a questionable level of protection. Two products, methiocarb (Mesurol) and anthraquinone (Flight Control), have shown promise as bird repellants. Both compounds were evaluated for repellancy to horned larks when applied on newly sprouted lettuce seedling in a field setting. Both compounds were equally effective and resulted in significantly less damage than occurred in control fields. Larger scale field testing of both products is planned in 1999.    Photo    Field Evaluation of Silt Fencing to Discourage Gull Nesting-- Gull populations in the Columbia River basin have been implicated in depredations to migrating endangered salmon smolt. Gulls nest on several islands near this resource. Silt fencing, a woven black polypropylene material, appears to discourage nesting gulls from these islands and to disperse the populations. The fencing was evaluated on Cabin Island, located above the Priest Rapids dam, Grant County, WA, and Upper Nelson Island located near Richland, Benton County, WA. The fencing was placed in parallel rows spaced 10 m apart within the nesting colonies. Preliminary results showed that the fencing, when used at a site with 3 previous years of egg oiling, reduced gull nesting by 89 percent (from 2,462 nests in 1997 to 261 nests in 1998). At the second site, results were inconclusive because high winds and unstable soil conditions collapsed the fencing. Further evaluation on the use of silt fencing as a gull nesting deterrent is warranted.    Photo    Bird Aircraft Strike Hazards at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, CA-- Birds present a direct hazard to aviation safety at Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI), San Diego, CA. NWRC biologists documented 27 bird-aircraft strikes on NASNI from April 1996 to April 1997. Of these, western gulls caused 77 percent, mallards 9 percent, American coots 5 percent, and great blue herons 5 percent. Other strikes were caused by barn swallows, ravens, and lesser scaup. Most strikes that occurred between March and September were attributed to western gulls, whereas strikes between October and February were attributed to waterfowl. The Command Navy Safety Center in Norfolk, VA, reported 102 bird strikes to aircraft at NASNI between 1980 and 1996. About half those strikes occurred during landing. The strike reporting rate is believed to be about 30 percent.    Bird-use patterns on NASNI varied by species, time, and location. Thirty-three species were identified on the airfield. The greatest bird activity occurred during May, with daily counts of approximately 1,600 birds-mostly western gulls. Waterfowl, specifically mallards and American coots, peaked during December and January. Western gulls, great blue herons, starlings, mourning doves, and pigeons made up about 96 percent of all birds observed crossing runways.    To understand bird movements in the area better, NWRC scientists color-marked 800 western gulls and fitted 12 others with satellite transmitters. Observations of color-marked gulls indicated that they dispersed to a number of other loafing or roosting sites away from NASNI. Of 650 gulls color-marked on NASNI, only 23 were observed at any 1 time at the Station, suggesting a high turnover rate of gulls. During the study period, 888 telemetry readings were obtained from the 12 western gulls fitted with satellite transmitters. Most of the gulls dispersed to other locations. Only 3 of 12 gulls consistently used NASNI. Overall, only 8-10 percent of the telemetry readings were on NASNI. The greatest distance a gull dispersed from NASNI was 800 km, to Monterey, CA.    Title: Management Strategies To Control Blackbird Damage in the United States    Goal: Reduce the magnitude of health, safety, and nuisance problems caused by blackbirds and improve agricultural production by reducing blackbird depredation losses in citrus- and fruit-producing enterprises and in sprouting and ripening corn, sunflower, rice, and other grains.    Photo    Blackbird Population and Damage Surveys in the Dakotas-- NWRC scientists are attempting to establish baseline data on breeding blackbird densities and damage to sunflower. During 1996 and 1997, the breeding blackbird population in Stutsman County, ND, averaged 22 pairs per 65 ha or approximately 199,000 pairs in the county. Each pair produces about 2 young, potentially swelling the county population to about 796,000 birds by late summer.    From 1994 to 1996, bird damage surveys were conducted within Stutsman County. Average annual crop damage within the townships was about 2.4 percent by volume. If one assumes an annual average production of about 200 million lb of sunflower in the county, the birds ate about 4.8 million lb of sunflower per year, valued at $480,000.    In future years, intensive breeding bird and damage surveys will be conducted in four counties in North Dakota and South Dakota. These data may be used to measure the efficacy of various damage abatement programs, to identify high-damage areas, and to establish the relationship between bird densities and damage levels. Acceptance of DRC-1339-treated rice baits by blackbirds continues to be a major problem. NWRC researchers tested a seed coating consisting of various clays and found it to deteriorate within 1 to 2 days in Louisiana's humid weather. Furthermore, blackbirds did not eat the coated rice seeds. Other coating materials will be tested in the future.    In another study, investigators determined local and migratory movement patterns for four blackbird roosts in Louisiana. Most blackbirds forage within 6 km of their roost, but some may move 60 km to feed. Birds marked in Louisiana before spring migration were found breeding in the Great Plains and Canada, indicating that some blackbirds damage both sunflower and rice.    Photo    Title: Development of Management Strategies To Reduce Piscivorous Bird Predation at Aquaculture Facilities    Goal: Determine the magnitude of, and develop methodology to reduce bird predation on cultured aquaculture products, including catfish, baitfish, tropical fish, trout, and other finfishes.    Photo    Cormorant Food Habit Studiesg- With the recent success of large-scale cormorant roost harassment efforts in the delta region of Mississippi, more cormorants have shifted their foraging activity to oxbow lakes along the Mississippi River. Prompted by concerns about the possible impact of cormorants on sport fishing, NWRC biologists conducted a cooperative study with the Mississippi Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Parks to evaluate the impact of cormorants on sport fish at a selected oxbow lake. Results of this food-habits study indicated that 87 percent of the diet by weight was shad, primarily gizzard shad, with most of the remainder (11 percent) consisting of bluegill. On the basis of cormorant numbers using the lake over a 4-month period, cormorants may have removed more than a million shad and a hundred thousand bluegill. However, the impact of cormorant predation on the overall sport fish industry may be minor.    The dramatic increase in the number of cormorants wintering in the Southern United States has coincided with the rapid rise of the catfish industry in this region. To determine whether the availability of commercially raised catfish has enhanced winter survival of cormorants and possibly contributed to this population increase, NWRC biologists compared the weights and body fat of cormorants collected in the delta region of Mississippi with those of cormorants collected in areas without catfish production. Cormorants collected on catfish farms were significantly heavier and had more body fat, suggesting that the availability of commercially raised catfish has resulted in improved overwinter survival and may have enhanced the breeding success of cormorants.    Photo    Wading Bird Predation on Catfish-- Wading birds, primarily great blue herons and great egrets, are frequent visitors at catfish ponds in the delta region of Mississippi, and most farmers consider them to have a significant impact on catfish production. A previous study by NWRC biologists indicated that a typical catfish farm in the delta supported about 22 great blue herons, each of which consumed 12 4-inch fingerlings daily. In 1995, NWRC biologists examined wading-bird predation during an entire year throughout the delta region. Thirty pond complexes were surveyed every 4-6 weeks for wading-bird populations. Where wading birds were present, their rate of predation on catfish was determined. In addition, farm managers were interviewed to determine if the health or density of fish might influence wading-bird behavior. The data suggest that great blue heron populations have increased threefold over the past 5 years, and thus the average catfish farm now supports 78 herons and 56 great egrets. Catfish constituted only 8 percent of the diet of great egrets but 44 percent of the diet of great blue herons. However, recent pen studies suggest that herons are inefficient foragers on healthy catfish and that additional research is needed to clarify actual production losses.    Photo    Title: Management of Wildlife that Pose  Hazards To Aviation    Goal: Develop safe and effective methods for reducing wildlife hazards to the air transport industry.    Photo    Research Provides Airports With New Tools for Reducing Bird Strikes-- The collision of aircraft with birds, deer, and other wildlife is a serious problem at airports throughout the United States. Through an interagency agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NWRC is conducting research in several areas to better understand and reduce the strike problem.    As one example, WS undertook an experimental program to reduce gull collisions with aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFKIA), New York between 1991 and 1997. In this program biologists stationed on airport boundaries used shotguns to shoot gulls flying over the airport. No nontarget species were affected, and no nontarget gulls (i.e., gulls not on airport property) were killed.    The program had a dramatic effect on bird strikes. The number of aircraft striking laughing gulls during the shooting period (May 20 to August 15) declined by 66 percent in 1991 and 76-89 percent in 1992-97 compared with numbers during the same time period for 1988-90. Strikes by other gull species were reduced comparably.    NWRC scientists developed an aerial photography technique to monitor the effect that the shooting program had on the nearby laughing gull colony. Results indicated that shooting reduced the local population but did not significantly lower the regional or national gull populations.    Another research effort evaluated the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system for nighttime detection of deer and other mammals on airport property. More than 350 civil aircraft collisions with deer have been reported in the United States since 1983, most of which resulted in serious damage to the aircraft. Detection of deer on airport property at night is critical to allow timely hazing of deer from runways and, from a long-term perspective, to develop, justify and evaluate deer management plans.    NWRC biologists compared the effectiveness of FLIR, spotlight, and night vision for detecting white-tailed deer at night in winter and summer 1997 at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Plum Brook Station, Erie County, OH. Biologists observed 20-70 percent more deer with FLIR than with spotlights or with night vision. In addition, 50 percent more raccoons were observed with FLIR than with the other devices.    This study indicates the FLIR system is the most effective means for nocturnal detection of deer at airports in summer and winter. In contrast to spotlighting, FLIR has the advantage of being unobtrusive. This characteristic should also make it an ideal monitoring aide for suburban deer populations. Moreover, FLIR may also prove useful for surveying raccoons.    Another major undertaking has been the management and analysis of FAA national data base on bird and other wildlife strikes with aircraft. Through an interagency agreement with the FAA, NWRC took over management of the FAA wildlife strike reporting system in 1995. Biologists now have over 19,000 strike reports between 1990 and 1998 edited and accurately entered into a National Wildlife Strike Data Base. Interpreting the forms, entering the data, and editing the data base have been tedious and complex undertakings, requiring personnel knowledgeable in birds, mammals, airports, and aircraft.    This data base is already proving to be invaluable in providing biologists, aeronautical engineers, and airport managers with specific information on strike histories for airports, aircraft and engine types, and regions of the United States. The data base allows biologists and engineers to better define problems by species, time of year, and other factors so that science-based management and preventative plans can be developed and evaluated. NWRC personnel have already handled more than 270 requests for information on bird strikes nationwide by biologists, engineers and aviation analysts. As more strike data are entered, the data base will become an even more powerful management, research and evaluation tool.    Effectiveness of Anthraquinone as a Grazing Repellant for Canada Geese and as a Seed-Treatment Repellant for Brown-Headed Cowbirds-- NWRC scientists evaluated the effectiveness of a 50 percent active ingredient formula of anthraquinone (Flight Control) as a grazing repellant for Canada geese and as a seed-treatment repellant for brown-headed cowbirds in northern Ohio in 1997. In a turf test, 2.5 times more bill contacts were observed on untreated plots compared with treated plots during a 7-day test with captive geese. Mean numbers of geese per observation were also greater on untreated plots compared with treated plots. Residue analyses indicated that the solution declined from 2.02 kg/ha on turf at application to 0.22 kg/ha after 1 week. In the cowbird test, individually caged cowbirds were presented untreated millet or millet treated with the anthraquinone bait at various concentrations in one-and two-choice tests for 3 to 4 days. Flight Control   was repellent to cowbirds at all levels in both one-and two-choice tests. Each group of treated birds in the one-choice test lost body weight, whereas the control group did not. Flight Control was an effective foraging repellant for Canada geese in a 7-day pen experiment and for brown-headed cowbirds as a seed repellant in aviary experiments.    Evaluation of U.S. Air Force Bird Avoidance Model-- An NWRC biologist has been working with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to reduce bird strikes to military aircraft. This is a very serious problem: since 1986, bird strikes have caused nearly $500 million in damage to USAF aircraft, and 33 people have been killed in bird-caused crashes. To reduce these losses, the USAF developed a Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) to evaluate low-level training routes for bird strike hazards throughout the contiguous United States. The current BAM, developed during the 1980's, incorporates waterfowl and raptor species, which collectively account for the majority of damaging bird strikes to military aircraft. Because changes have occurred to waterfowl and raptor populations throughout North America, there is speculation that the BAM (developed and currently run with historical waterfowl and raptor data) may not accurately predict bird strike hazards. Therefore, the NWRC biologist compared bird-strike hazards predicted by the BAM for those low-level routes where waterfowl and raptor strikes occurred with a random selection of published low-level routes where waterfowl and raptor strikes were not reported.    Mean predicted bird strike hazards for waterfowl and raptors were higher for routes where strikes had occurred than for routes where strikes by these species had not occurred. Thus, the BAM has successfully predicted mean bird strike hazards along low-level training routes for the military, and, when properly used, can assist with flight planning to minimize waterfowl and raptor strike hazards. From April 1996 to July 1998, the NWRC biologist has evaluated 2,500 training routes and areas for bird strike hazards for various military branches.    Title: Development of Nonlethal Chemical  Repellants forBirds    Goal: Develop methodologies that contribute toward the discovery and practical development of nonlethal, environmentally benign chemical repellants for use in resolving conflicts between wildlife and agriculture and industry.    Integrated Hazing Systems for Birds--Effective nonlethal chemical repellants have been developed to protect commodities from being eaten by birds. However, these repellants require direct application to the surface of the resource to be protected, and birds must sample the material before they are repelled. This sampling leads to crop damage and, if the bird population is sufficently large, will result in unacceptable economic losses.    NWRC scientists, in cooperation with a CSU master's degree student, evaluated an integrated hazing system designed by Knight Piesold, Ltd., and employed at PacifiCorp's Jim Bridger Power Plant in Wyoming. The concept behind this system was to combine existing bird-control technologies into a system that would protect large areas (36- and 73-ha ponds) by preventing birds from landing on contaminated ponds for extended time periods. The system consisted of pyrotechnic launchers, acoustic scaring devices, and aerosol sprayers. Control and activation of the system were achieved using specialized software, a computer, and marine radar. The computer and radar were critical to the success of the system because they enabled the setup to activate the hazing devices only when birds flew within the protected airspace and to turn on only those devices near the intruders. The aerosol-applied chemical repellant reinforced the visual and audio scaring devices.    Over the course of a year, this demand-performance integrated system was 85-percent effective in reducing flyovers by waterfowl at two desulfurization ponds and 92 percent effective in reducing landings relative to the control pond. Moreover, the 24-h protection afforded by this system was 60 percent better at detecting birds than were ground observers and resulted in an annual savings of 4,000 hours of labor for the power company over labor expended on normal hazing operations. It may be possible to adapt this system to protect catfish ponds from depredating birds.    Table of Contents         MAMMAL RESEARCH PROJECTS    Title: Control of Rodent Damage  to Hawaiian AgriculturalCrops    Goal: Develop safer and more effective methods for reducing rat damage to Hawaiian agricultural crops.    Controlling Roof Rat Populations in Macadamia Orchards-- To design more effective control methods for roof rat populations in Hawaiian macadamia orchards, scientists must better understand the foraging behavior of this pest. Past and present research by staff of the NWRC Hawaii field station has been directed toward this goal. Past research efforts have identified key aspects of roof rat foraging behavior in macadamia orchards. Radio-tracking studies have determined that roof rats forage nocturnally in macadamia trees and spend little time, if any, foraging on the ground. A subsequent study using nontoxic bait treated with a biomarker showed that a significantly higher proportion of roof rats in macadamia orchards feed on bait placed in trees compared with bait placed on the ground or in burrows.    Macadamia growers in Hawaii currently try to control troublesome rat populations in their orchards by broadcasting rodenticides on the orchard floor. This use pattern does not appear to be appropriate in light of recent data on roof-rat foraging behavior.    Working with other NWRC scientists, Hawaii Department of Agriculture specialists and commercial manufacturers, the staff from NWRC's Hawaii field station helped to obtain a State registration for the use of the anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone for use in bait boxes secured in macadamia trees. This registration may provide macadamia producers with a precise technique to control roof rat damage right where it occurs. Additional studies will be required to determine the economic thresholds for practical use of this rodent damage-control technique by producers.    Development of More Cost-Effective Methods To Control Rats in Hawaiian Native Habitats-- Scientists at NWRC's Hawaii field station are assisting other Federal and State agencies, conservation organizations, and private landowners in Hawaii in efforts to control rats in native forest habitats. A graduate student at the University of Hawaii, working with staff at NWRC's Hawaii field station, completed research for her master of science thesis in 1997 by examining rodenticide bait requirements for broadcast applications of an anticoagulant rodenticide in Hawaiian native forests.    Both the Polynesian rat, introduced to the islands in association with early Polynesians, and the roof rat, introduced later by ship traffic, cause extensive damage to agricultural crops-particularly sugarcane and macadamia nuts. These rodents have also contributed significantly to the precipitous declines in endemic Hawaiian flora and fauna, preying on birds, eggs, native plants, and invertebrates and competing with native species for food and habitat.    The rodenticide diphacinone is already available for agricultural and conservation applications in bait stations, but its cost and the labor-intensive nature of the use of bait stations limit the effectiveness of the technique in the rugged, isolated part of Hawaii that remain in native forest habitat.    Because aerial application of weatherproof bait pellets might overcome these limitations, NWRC personnel designed laboratory trials to determine minimum realistic dose rates and exposure times. Commercial 2.5-g pellets (containing 0.005 percent diphacinone active ingredient) were provided to both rodent species at varying rates. Six days of exposure and 30.0 g (12 pellets/rat) caused 90-percent mortality for Polynesian rats.    In actual field use, bait consumption and mortality rates would be expected to increase because rats continue to consume bait after ingesting a lethal dose. For field effectiveness, it will be important to develop application systems and baiting rates that allow all rats in an area to consume the rodenticide.    The long history of safe use of diphacinone in a variety of environments and the considerable existing data on its human health and ecological effects may make its use in native habitats an important tool for preserving Hawaii's native plants and animals.    Title: Integrated Pest Management Strategies for Wildlife Damage to Agriculture    Goal: Develop, test, and evaluate innovative and integrated methods and models to reduce wildlife damage to agricultural crops and property.    Photo    Repellent and Nutrition Research With Captive Porcupines-- Porcupines cause significant localized damage to reforestation, agriculture, and structures in the Western United States. Currently, there is a heavy reliance on lethal methods to reduce porcupine numbers and subsequent damage. There is a need to develop effective nonlethal methods, such as repellants, to reduce potential hazards to protected and nontarget species. Unfortunately, little is known about the foraging ecology, nutritional requirements, and digestive abilities of these secretive, mostly nocturnal rodents.    NWRC scientists and faculty and graduate students of Washington State University have conducted a series of studies with captive porcupines. In nutrition trials, porcupines maintained their weight on diets of apple, acorns, or alfalfa, all of which are highly digestible. On a diet of willow leaves, however, porcupines did not maintain their weight. Although willow leaves have relatively high levels of some nutrients (such as nitrogen, crude protein, and energy), they also have the highest fiber content of tested materials, reducing digestibility.    In tests of potential repellants in pen trials, some materials (predator urines, semiochemicals, capsaicin, paradichlorobenzene, and 21-percent Thiram®) protected pine branches from foraging porcupines, whereas other materials (such as denatonium benzoate, denatonium saccharide, garlic oil, and 7-percent Thiram) did not repel porcupines. Semiochemicals (compounds isolated from predator anal glands) deterred porcupine feeding not only on treated pine branches but also on untreated branches nearby. Field trials will be conducted to assess efficacy and duration of protection under natural conditions.    Potential Repellants To Deter Black Bear Damage to Trees-- Upon emergence from hibernation   in spring,   black bears damage young, fast-growing forest trees in many parts of the Pacific Northwest. The bears are seeking the sweet, nutritious cambium under the tree's bark. Damage to western larch, a highly prized commercial conifer species, in northern Idaho and western Montana can be locally severe. Forest and wildlife managers have relied on spring bear hunts to reduce bear populations and, hence, the potential for subsequent tree damage.    NWRC scientists are now investigating nonlethal approaches to reduce bear damage to trees. Potential repellants were applied to western larch trees about 15 m tall in commercially thinned stands on State land in northern Idaho in early spring. The materials tested were denatonium benzoate (a very bitter compound), capsaicin (a very hot compound), and a water-based slurry of grizzly bear feces. The slurry was used because black bears are very fearful of grizzly bears and presumably of their odors. All three repellants were equally effective in these preliminary trials.    Investigators returned in late summer and found that 20 percent of the untreated (control) trees had been damaged by bears, whereas only about 10 percent of trees treated with one of three potential repellants were damaged. It appears that repellants can be used to reduce bear damage to conifer trees, but additional trials are needed to confirm these findings. It also will be important to find an efficient, cost-effective method of using repellants over large areas and in inclement weather situations.    Photo     Integrated Pest Management of Pocket Gophers-- Pocket gophers are small burrowing rodents native to much of North America. Gophers cause damage by feeding on crops and young trees, chewing on buried cables, burrowing into dikes and levies, and producing large earthen mounds that damage field machinery. Control of gopher damage has relied on the placement of toxic baits or kill traps in burrows, but these methods are becoming increasingly expensive. In many areas, toxicants and traps have been restricted or forbidden outright.    NWRC scientists have conducted many studies to find ways to reduce gopher damage, including chemical, physical, and cultural methods. Additionally, Center scientists are investigating integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to reduce gopher damage. An IPM approach is especially important given the reproductive capabilities and rapid reinvasion rates of gophers into good habitat. Three components are necessary to implement an IPM strategy to reduce gopher damage: the ability to assess the potential risk for damage, techniques for monitoring gopher populations and assessing efficacy of control methods, and damage-control strategies and methods.    Gopher populations respond to many natural and human-induced habitat factors: soil type, elevation, slope, plant association, type of crop, and land-use practices, such as irrigation, fertilization, and herbicide application. Reduction of gopher damage should involve the manipulation of habitats and land-use practices to make sites less supportive of high gopher population densities. If an area has a history of gopher damage or high densities can be expected, the gopher population should be monitored closely. The feasibility, effectiveness, and legality of all possible damage-reduction methods, materials, and strategies should be evaluated. Often, more than one method should be employed to reduce damage or the potential for damage effectively. Crop growers and forest managers can benefit from the use of IPM strategies to reduce damage by gophers.    Title: Development and Evaluation  of New Techniques forResolving Predator Depredation Problems    Goal: Develop new or improved control technology systems for operational use in predator management.    Effectiveness of an Electronic Dog-Training Collar for Deterring Coyote Attacks on Domestic Sheep-- New and improved methods are needed to deter predators from killing livestock. NWRC and CSU scientists tested the effectiveness of an electronic dog-training collar for deterring captive coyotes from killing domestic lambs by shocking coyotes whenever they attempted to attack lambs during a 22-week period. The electronic collar averted all 13 attempted attacks on lambs by 5 coyotes, greatly reduced the probability of attempted attacks, and caused coyotes to avoid and retreat from lambs for more than 4 months. This approach to aversive conditioning has potential for reducing coyote predation on domestic sheep in limited areas and may be applicable to a variety of other problems involving carnivore predation on domestic or endangered species.    Photo    Title: Management of Livestock  Depredation: Developing More Selective Control Strategies    Goal: Develop effective and environmentally responsible strategies for reducing livestock depredation through selective targeting of predators.    Coyote Research in North-Coastal California: Identifying Sheep Killers-- Coyote depredation of sheep has been studied during the past five and a half years at the University of California's (UC) Hopland Research and Extension Center. A succession of 4 graduate students from UC-Berkeley together with 23 field assistants conducted the research. An underlying objective was to learn more about those coyotes that kill sheep. The researchers assumed that if sheep-killing coyotes could be characterized, then control methods appropriate to the behavior of these animals could be developed.    In total, 65 coyotes were captured and radio-collared, and their space-use patterns were determined at over 18,000 tracking locations. During this time, 371 sheep confirmed to have been killed by coyotes, and 57 coyotes were removed in control efforts by trappers and Hopland personnel. In addition, field station records on predation losses attributed to coyotes and on coyote removals were analyzed for the 13-year period preceding the study. This represents the most intensive study to date of the space use and movements of coyotes on a large sheep ranch with annual coyote control.    Several lines of evidence support the conclusions that relatively few coyotes in the local population kill sheep and that these coyotes are primarily alpha pairs whose territories overlap pastures with sheep-particularly those with lambs. First, analysis of station records showed a trend of negative correlation between numbers of coyotes removed and subsequent depredation losses, suggesting that not all coyotes killed sheep and that control was inconsistent at removing those that did. Second, sheep kills were clustered in time and space. Third, radio tracking showed that coyotes used contiguous territories in the presence of sheep such that coyotes whose territories did not overlap pastures with sheep did not have access to them. In addition, coyotes located close to sheep kills near the estimated time of death have been alpha males. Fourth, nonselective removal of coyotes during the 1995 and 1996 lambing seasons did not stop depredation until removal of one or both of the alpha males in whose territory the kills occurred. Finally, a strategy of selective removal was used during the 1997 and 1998 lambing seasons. Removal was done primarily with the Livestock Protection Collar and involved only one to three coyotes per year. This removal effectively stopped depredation.    Title: Ecology of Coyote Depredation    Goal: Determine interrelationships between depredation on livestock and the abundance and behavior of predators and natural prey.    Decline of the Swift Fox in North America-- The swift fox historically ranged from northern Texas to southern Canada. The range and abundance of this small burrowing predator underwent a widespread reduction in the 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly in response to human activities. This decline continues, and there is speculation that a major factor is competition with and by coyotes. Coyotes sometimes kill foxes and actively discourage them from using carcasses. Efforts to reintroduce the swift fox in Canada have been severely hampered by high fox mortalities, 50-60 percent of which are caused by coyotes.    Determining resource overlap between swift foxes and coyotes is essential to fox recovery efforts. NWRC biologists are studying overlap on the Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site in southern Colorado. Field work began in January 1997. To date, 180 foxes have been captured, and 73 have been radio collared: 34 males and 39 females. More than 10,000 telemetry locations have been made, and 1,000 den sites have been identified during the past 20 months.    At present, biologists are following 42 foxes and 17 coyotes. During 1997, eight dead foxes were documented; three of these were killed by coyotes. Another fox was killed by a badger, and one drowned in a stock tank constructed from a tractor tire. During 1998, coyote predation is suspected in 10 of the 15 fox deaths that have been documented.    NWRC biologists are also monitoring fox den sites to collect information about litter size and mortality before dispersal. In 1997, 12 of 18 social groups raised kits, but in 1998, only 14 of 25 groups produced offspring. Before the fall dispersal in August 1997, biologists collared 10 young of the year. Four of these animals died before reaching 1 year of age, and two more disappeared. The approximate reproductive chronology of swift foxes is December 15-April 14 for breeding and gestation, April 15-August 14 for pup rearing, and August15-December 14 for dispersal.    Photo    Title: Reproductive Intervention  Strategies for Managing Coyote Predation    Goal: Determine whether sheep losses to predation can be reduced by sterilizing coyotes on territories where sheep and other livestock are pastured. Determine if sterilization is a viable method of reducing coyote densities. Develop and transfer intormation critical to the registration and/or practical application of sterilant technologies and pharmaceutical products.    Immunization with Porcine Zona Pellucida To Cause Complete Infertility in Coyotes--NWRC scientists in Fort Collins, CO, and Logan, UT, have used immunization with porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to cause complete infertility in coyotes. Zona pellucida is a glycoprotein surrounding eggs in the female reproductive tract of mammals. Because the zona pellucida is similar in all species, researchers can use glycoprotein from swine to develop a vaccine for use in coyotes. In one study at NWRC, female coyotes were vaccinated in December 1997 and received two booster vaccinations in January 1998. No coyote that received the PZP vaccine had a litter, whereas all females receiving a placebo vaccine showed normal reproductive success. Otherwise, the breeding and territorial behaviors of treated and control coyotes were indistinguishable.    Over the next several years, NWRC biologists will attempt to isolate the portion of the PZP molecule responsible for contraceptive effects. This information is critical to the development of an orally deliverable, consistently effective, species-specific vaccine. Experiments also will attempt to identify a practical technology for the oral delivery of vaccine.    Photo    Title: Sensory and Behavioral Methods  for Managing Predation on Livestock    Goal: Identify chemical repellants and deterrant methods and create attractive baits for target-specific delivery of pharmaceutical substances to reduce livestock depredation.    Visual Information for Prey Detection by Coyotes-- Although chemical and auditory cues are important, coyotes typically rely on visual information for prey detection. Such cues are relatively immune to interference from wind, rain, and ambient temperature and can provide reliable information about prey type and location over relatively long distances. Despite their importance to foraging coyotes, the practical impact of visual cues as components of lures and attractants remains poorly understood. This lack of formal investigation is surprising because visual stimuli (e.g., plastic strips, bones, feathers) are sometimes used to orient coyotes in relation to traps, snares, and other devices.    NWRC scientists have shown that color can affect the distance at which wooden dowels are detected by captive coyotes as well as the likelihood that coyotes will approach dowels and pull them from the ground. Colors that stand out from the background are more attractive than colors that blend in. These findings have practical implications. For instance, colors might be used to increase the detection and activation of sodium cyanide ejectors (M-44's) by free-ranging coyotes. Although these devices are typically used to deliver a toxicant, they also represent an ideal mechanism for the delivery of vaccines and other pharmaceutical substances.    Research on this subject began in March 1997 at three study locations in Box Elder County, UT, and one location in Huron County, OH. Twenty M-44's were positioned at each location, and each was placed at the center of a 1-m circle that had been raked clear of debris. M-44 sites were randomly selected at 40 m perpendicular to an access road and 0.75 km or more apart. No M-44 was armed, no chemical lures were used, and 10 units were fitted with a black rubber top prepared from a 2-cm section of soaker hose. The remaining 10 units were fitted with white rubber tops. All sites were visited at 2-day intervals to record the number of tripped M-44's, and to identify any tracks near M-44's. Data were categorized according to M-44 color (black, white) and background (snow, no snow). Pulls were most frequent for white M-44's against a no-snow background, and were next most frequent for black M-44's regardless of background. White M-44's against a snow background were not pulled.    At all study locations, M-44's were activated by species other than coyotes. In Utah, mule deer tripped devices. In Ohio, M-44's were pulled by raccoons, white-tailed deer, and striped skunks. The apparent lack of species specificity was unexpected and should be investigated further. Findings are consistent with the notion that color can be used to improve the detection and activation of M-44's.    Title: Analysis of Taste and Olfaction  in Selected Wildlife Species    Goal: Apply the methodology and findings from basic multidisciplinary chemosensory research to the development of new methods for controlling wildlife damage.    In Vitro Assays for the Identification of New Nonlethal Repellants-- NWRC scientists and specialists at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, PA, have developed in vitro assays for the identification of new nonlethal repellants. Effective repellants tend to be irritants that stimulate trigeminal neurons. For in vitro assays, trigeminal neurons were collected from one or two animals and then cultured in the laboratory. The responsiveness of these neurons to candidate compounds is measured using digital fluorescent imaging. To date, neurons from rats, guinea pigs, chickens, coyotes, white-tailed deer, Canada geese, and mallard ducks have been studied.    Rat and coyote neurons; guinea pig and deer neurons; and chicken, goose, and duck neurons tend to show similar response patterns. This finding suggests that rat nociceptors (nerves for receiving and transmitting painful stimuli) may be used as models for coyote nociceptors, guinea pig for deer nociceptors, and chicken for goose and duck nociceptors. One practical implication of this new technology is that hundreds of candidate repellants can be screened in the time that it previously took to screen a few compounds behaviorally. Lab screening using neurons also requires fewer experimental animals. It may eventually be possible to identify specific characteristics of molecules that predict irritation, thereby permitting the rational design of new repellent products.    Title: Reducing Mammal Damage To  Forest Resources    Goal: Provide feasible and effective methods for reducing wildlife damage to forest resources.    The Impact of Timber Management on the Phytochemicals Associated With Black Bear Damage-- Black bears forage on Douglas-fir vascular tissue in the spring, and this behavior can be severely detrimental to the health and economic value of a timber stand. Foraging is selective in that not all stands are damaged, and within a stand one tree may be stripped while its neighbor is ignored or minimally sampled. NWRC scientists conducted a series of studies to assess whether bear selectivity is affected by chemical constituents within vascular tissue and whether these constituents are affected by silvicultural practices. Tree selection by black bears is at least in part related to the concentrations of sugars and terpenes present in vascular tissue. Bears foraging in environments that offer choices are likely to select trees that offer the highest sugar-to-terpene ratio. This research suggests that the sugar-to-terpene ratio of Douglas-fir vascular tissue can be reduced by cultivating trees at higher stand densities and by pruning live crown cover. Urea fertilization affects the ratio only during the initial couple of seasons after application.    Although sugar concentrations are affected by environmental factors, terpene concentrations can be increased through genetic selection. It appears possible to select trees containing greater concentrations of terpenes without affecting positive attributes such as productivity.    Relationships Among Beaver Density, Beaver Dams, and Damage to Forest Resources in the Pacific Northwest-- Staff from the NWRC Olympia, WA, field station are conducting a study of the relationship between beaver density and the damage to timber resources at 16 sites in Oregon coastal forests. Cooperators include Oregon timber companies, private wildlife damage specialists, and Oregon WS personnel.    From November 1997 to March 1998, NWRC scientists measured beaver damage to conifers and hardwoods and tested potential beaver density indices. The same sites are being monitored from November 1997 to November 1998 to determine the time between beaver removal and the arrival of new beaver and the durability of dams after beaver removal. Beaver density was determined by removing all beaver from sites scheduled for beaver trapping to reduce damage problems. The number of dams, dens, slides, and food caches was recorded for each site. Most den sites (91 percent) were bank dens, and a few den sites (9 percent) had lodges built as an extension of a bank den. Only two sites had a food cache.    There was no relationship between beaver density and the density of dams, dens, or active beaver slides. However, sites with higher beaver densities did have greater amounts of timber damage. Average beaver damage in areas with high beaver density ranged from 40 percent of trees 0-10 m from the waterline to 11 percent of trees 30-40 m from the waterline. Average beaver damage in areas with low beaver density ranged from 18 percent of trees 0-10 m from the waterline to 2 percent of trees 30-40 m from the waterline.    The lack of relationship between beaver density and dam density indicates that a small number of beaver may be able to maintain a relatively large number of dams. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the number of beaver in a colony and associated beaver damage without reducing the number of beaver dams and ponds. These ponds are perceived to provide important habitat for a variety of species, including the coho salmon, which is a candidate for listing as an endangered species in this section of Oregon. Data from this study will aid wildlife managers in developing plans that reduce beaver damage while preserving important fish and wildlife habitat.    Table of Contents         PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH PROJECTS    Title: Evaluation of Rodent Control Chemicals    Goal: Develop safe, effective chemical methods to reduce rodent damage to agricultural crops and rangeland and to provide for public health and safety.    Zinc Phosphide in Norway Rat Acute Dry Laboratory Tests-- In the laboratory, NWRC biologists evaluated a 1.0-percent zinc phosphide-oat groat grain bait for controlling domestic Norway rats. Sixty white rats, 20 control and 40 treated, were placed on a 3-day, two-choice feeding study. Control rats received two dishes (40 g each) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) rat and mouse challenge diet while the treated rats received a 40-g dish of the 1.0-percent treated bait and a 40-g dish of the OPP rat and mouse challenge diet. After 24 hours' exposure to the bait, 34 treated rats (85 percent) died; at 48 h, 2 additional rats (5 percent) died. The four animals (10 percent) that survived were basically noneaters of the treated bait. No control rats died. On day 1, the 40 treated rats consumed an average of 0.80 g of zinc phosphide bait and 2.13 g of challenge diet.    Differences between consumption of the two bait types were not significant for females but were significant for males. The mean intake of zinc phosphide on day 1 for the 36 rats that died was 48.52 mg per kg of body weight. The mean total intake for the four rats that survived was 15.70 mg/kg and ranged from 1.57 to 34.62 mg/kg. The 90- percent mortality exceeds the minimum efficacy standard of 70 percent established by EPA for rodenticides. These data will be submitted as a partial fulfillment for the reregistration of California's 1.0-percent zinc phosphide label.    A second study, sponsored by the California Vertebrate Pest Control Research Advisory Council (CVPCRAC) through a cooperative agreement with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), evaluated the efficacy of 2.0-percent zinc phosphide grain baits on Norway rats. EPA had informed CDFA that efficacy data on zinc phosphide for controlling Norway rats were required as a partial fulfillment for their reregistration of zinc phosphide commensal rodent label. The objective was to evaluate 2.0-percent bait acceptance and efficacy of zinc phosphide bait for controlling Norway rats. All 40 Norway rats tested on the 2.0-percent zinc phosphide grain bait died after day 1.    Efficacy of Bromethalin Against the California Ground Squirrel-- CVPCRAC also funded a laboratory study at NWRC through a cooperative agreement with CDFA to determine the efficacy of pelleted bromethalin baits in controlling California ground squirrels. Bromethalin is registered in the United States at 0.01 percent for commensal rodent control, and the CVPCRAC wanted to expand the registration to include field and rangeland rodents. A series of laboratory tests was conducted to determine if bromethalin is effective and has potential to control California ground squirrels. The objective was to determine the minimum bromethalin concentration producing 100- percent mortality, but after the first test, the focus was modified to determine if the 0.01-percent concentration was capable of producing 70-percent or greater mortality.    For the first test, 29 ground squirrels were placed on a 3-day, no-choice feeding study with 0.01-, 0.03-, or 0.10-percent pelleted bromethalin bait, and each animal was given 10 g of bait daily. Three of nine ground squirrels (33 percent) offered the 0.01-percent baits died within 3 days. Mortality was 80 percent for animals offered 0.03-percent baits and 100 percent for animals offered 0.10-percent baits. The total bromethalin ingested by the animals averaged 3.39, 4.37, and 7.86 mg/kg respectively.    In a second test, 60 California ground squirrels were selected for a 3-day, no-choice feeding test that exposed them to untreated baits or baits containing 0.01- percent or 0.03-percent pelleted bromethalin. The quantity of bait given each animal was increased to 20 g daily.    Mortality in the 0.01-percent and 0.03-percent treatment groups was 25 and 65 percent respectively; no control animals died. The total bromethalin ingested by the animals averaged 3.84 and 4.16 mg/kg at the two dosage levels.    In the third test, bromethalin formulated on oat groats was used instead of pelleted baits. This test was a 3-day, no-choice feeding test with a control group of 12 animals and 3 other groups of 12 animals each on the following 3 concentrations: 0.01, 0.03, and 0.10 percent bromethalin. Each animal was given 20 g of bait daily. Mortality was 17 percent for animals offered the 0.01-percent bait, 25 percent for the 0.03-percent bait, and 75 percent for the 0.10-percent bait; no control animals died. The total bromethalin ingested by the animals averaged 4.42, 2.81, and 7.37 mg/kg, respectively.    These data suggest that the minimum concentration producing the maximum mortality is approximately 0.07 percent, and the maximum mortality is approached when California ground squirrels consume a mean of 6.72 mg/kg of bromethalin in a single feeding.    Photo    Title: Research and Development of  New Repellent Technologiesfor Rodents    Goal: Develop new, effective, environmentally safe behavior-biological- chemical repellent methods for reducing rodent damage to agricultural crops-grasslands, above- and below-ground cables, water impoundments, and farm buildings.    Photo    Capsaicin-Laden Soil Deters Digging by Gophers-- NWRC scientists are trying to develop novel gopher repellent products and technologies. One of these technologies used the injection of chemicals into soil, an approach developed by the termite-control industry to create barriers to subterranean termites along the foundations of dwellings. This technology is currently being evaluated with gophers as a means for deterring burrowing behavior. Preliminary results have demonstrated feasibility for capsaicin oleoresin as a deterrent to gopher digging. In a comparison of 5-, 10-, and 15-percent concentrations of capsaicin in soil, gophers spent increased time grooming and decreased time contacting and digging in treated soil at the higher concentrations. However, these effects were variable among animals.    Reducing Pocket Gopher Damage to Cables-- With their characteristic gnawing and digging behaviors, pocket gophers can cut wire and fiber optic cable installations. NWRC scientists are evaluating bitter-tasting and hot-flavored chemicals such as denatonium benzoate and capsaicin in different cable-coating configurations to optimize repellancy as the animals attempt to gnaw.    Research has indicated that chemical surface coatings on the outer sheath of cable samples are ineffective in producing sustained repellancy under most conditions. However, the addition of a second sheath containing the agent could greatly increase repellent effects by enhancing contact with the chemical as the gophers attempt to gnaw. Studies have indicated that between 0.5 and 1.0 cm 3  of this material across 10 cm 3  of cable are sufficient to repel northern pocket gophers reliably over 10-day exposure periods.    Title: New Solutions for Wildlife Problems Through Biotechnology: Immunocontraception of Wildlife Pest Species    Goal: Develop and field-test economical and effective immunocontraceptive vaccines to control populations of pest mammalian and avian species.    Field Applications of Contraception for Managing Overabundant Deer Herds-- NWRC is in the second year of a cooperative project with Cornell University at the Seneca Army Depot in central New York to develop field applications of contraception for deer. During 1997, 33 white-tailed deer were vaccinated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) immunocontraceptive vaccine. These 33 deer produced 4 fawns total, or 0.12 fawn/doe, as compared with 1 fawn/doe in the control group. During 1998, in addition to the 33 GnRH deer, 25 deer vaccinated with PZP were added to the study. NWRC scientists are also testing single-dose GnRH vaccines using Freund's adjuvant and a new water-soluble adjuvant. Such single-dose vaccines will make immunocontraception a more practical tool for wildlife management. All deer were vaccinated using a dart gun. Fawning counts indicate that contraceptive vaccines have been very effective.    Avian Contraception-NWRC scientists, in cooperation with a CSU graduate student, tested three avian contraceptives using coturnix quail as a test species. Two compounds were immunocontraceptives targeting AGnRH (avian gonadotropin-releasing hormone) and cRCP (riboflavin carrier protein).    The immunocontraceptive vaccines gave poor results overall but did effectively contracept a few birds. Researchers believe that the failure of the vaccines to produce consistent results is due to an improper vaccination protocol. The other contraceptive is a cholesterol mimic, DiazaCon®. DiazaCon produced good results, shutting down egg production almost completely in females and producing infertility in males. Because it can be delivered via ingestion, DiazaCon has immediate potential for use in the field.    Title: Development of Analytical Chemical Methodology for Wildlife Research    Goal: Develop and apply new analytial chemistry techniques and approaches to wildlife research problems.    3-Chloro- p -toluidine Hydrochloride (CPTH) Residue Methodology-- NWRC chemists completed methodology to quantify CPTH residues in avian tissue accurately. Previous methods suffered from extremely variable recoveries. For the new method, deuterated CPTH (CPTH-d6) was synthesized and used as a surrogate for CPTH. Owing to a difference in molecular weight of 6 atomic mass units, CPTH and CPTH-d6 can be differentiated by mass spectrometry. However, because of the extreme similarity of their chemical structures, recoveries for both compounds were virtually identical over a broad range of fortification levels. Recoveries of CPTH-d6 fortified into real field samples can be used to convert observed concentrations of CPTH residues into actual concentrations of incurred residues. This approach is critical for the accurate estimation of secondary hazards associated with the potential secondary consumption of target birds following CPTH operations.    Pesticide Residues in California Range Grass-- CVPCRAC funded NWRC research to develop a solid-phase extraction methodology to quantify chlorophacinone and diphacinone residues in California range grass. These analytical methods will be used by NWRC and other labs to support field studies required for the registration of chlorophaci-none and diphacinone to mitigate rangeland rodent damage.    Sapwood Testing Methods-- NWRC researchers developed analytical methodology and used it to quantify terpenes and carbohydrates in sapwood collected from commercial Douglas-fir stands. Studies conducted by Center biologists and chemists have shown that bear damage to trees is more likely when sapwood carbohydrate content is high, terpene content is low, or both. Analysis of sapwood samples from trees subjected to a variety of standard silvicultural practices suggests that carbohydrate content increases after fertilization or thinning and decreases after pruning. These data offer the timber industry nonlethal approaches to reduce losses resulting from bear damage.    Title: Development of Control Methods for the Control of the Brown Tree Snake    Goal: Develop techniques to help control brown tree snakes on Guam and prevent their dispersal from that island.    Photo    Background-- NWRC research into development of chemical methods for managing the brown tree snake (BTS) began in 1995 under Department of Defense (DoD) legacy funding. Fiscal year (FY) 1998 was the last year of the original project. The goal of this project was to develop chemical control methods (fumigants, toxicants, attractants, and repellants) that can be used in an integrated program to control and prevent the dispersal of the BTS from Guam and to reduce or help control snake populations in various island situations. NWRC has achieved considerable success in meeting these goals in a relatively short time for a species about which almost no such data were available in 1995.    Development of Toxicants and Toxicant Delivery Devices-- Previous work identified several oral and dermal pesticides as being toxic to the BTS. Also, previous work with live traps showed that a dead mouse was effective for attracting snakes and that wire-mesh live traps had potential use in delivering toxicants. Because large-scale use of devices similar to live traps would be expensive, the goal of the FY 1998 research was to identify effective, less expensive devices. Three potential toxicant delivery devices with a dead mouse lure were evaluated: a commercial wire-mesh trap with one entry, a two-piece wire-mesh snake trap, and plastic pipe. The two-piece snake trap and plastic pipe were tested with one and two entries. The devices were randomly placed along transect lines for 4 consecutive days in several types of habitat. The mean overall visitation rate for the wire-mesh snake trap and plastic devices ranged from 10 to 13 percent and 13 to 16 percent, respectively. These results indicated that plastic pipe devices were equivalent to wire-mesh devices; plastic pipe devices are also less expensive. Additionally, the maximum effectiveness of the dead mouse lure was on days 2 and 3, probably reflecting its rapid rate of decomposition on Guam.    A concern about the use of toxicants is the potential for nontarget exposure. To address this nontarget issue, 20 camera surveillance detection systems were used under field conditions on Guam to monitor animals visiting one of the previously mentioned potential toxicant delivery devices. A dead mouse was placed inside the delivery device, and the surveillance systems recorded animal visits to it when placed along transects in forest and fenceline habitats for 24 h a day. The total exposure-nights for these 20 devices in the forest and fenceline habitats were 210 and 119, respectively. Animals recorded in the forest included 58 snakes and 2 animals tentatively identified as crabs. Animals recorded along fencelines included 8 snakes, 3 geckos, and 1 animal tentatively identified as a rat. This low level of nontarget activity suggests that judicious use of snake toxicants would not have a major impact on nontarget animals.    Photo    Development of an Inanimate Lure and Attractants-- The goal of this research is to identify inanimate attractants, and substantial progress has been made in this effort. Previous research indicated that the odor of dead mice was sufficient to lure the BTS into traps but the odor of live mice alone, was not sufficent. A simultaneous visual cue had to be present to be effective. In FY 1998, decomposition odors were identified, and an artificial carrion odor was formulated to examine the carrion odor attraction phenomenon more thoroughly. However, owing to formulation and delivery problems, this formulation was ineffective (relative to live mice) for capturing brown tree snakes. Research is under way to develop emitter tubes that will more efficiently deliver appropriate concentrations of the components of the dead mouse odor as a chemical attractant.    Other field research on carrion odors showed seasonal variation in their attractiveness to the BTS. During the dry season on Guam, odor-only carrion lures were not as effective as they were during the wet season. Because one aim of the research was not to fail in attracting nearby snakes, the research approach was altered to include complex visual stimuli in the carrion odor delivery system.    It is likely that a careful combination of stimuli may allow the development of a lure that is even more effective than the live mice currently being used. The Center currently is evaluating a lure device that combines movement and odor into a ""super-normal stimulus suite."" Initial testing of the device has shown that the multisensory approach is effective in attracting snakes.    Identification of Snake Repellants-- Center scientists are attempting to identify compounds that can be used to drive snakes from enclosed spaces. The FY 1998 experiments focused on five active natural product ingredients as snake repellants. These products were selected from the extensive list of ingredients and natural products tested in FY 1997 based on their likelihood of meeting human health and safety concerns as well as their likelihood of requiring the least amount of support data for registration by EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).    Tests were conducted initially on the efficacy of thermal fogs on snakes contained in simulated cargo. Unfortunately, this delivery mode destroyed the activity of the repellant. Tests are now concentrating on delivery systems in the form of cold-generated fogs and vapor-buoyant forms of the repellant. These delivery forms are desirable because they have greater penetrating power for complexly configured crevices and, hence, should have an increased likelihood of reaching the snakes. Because of their particle sizes, aerosols work well but tend to be restricted in use to direct line of sight. A convenient, portable repellent-delivery device would be useful in many situations, including assisting WS canine units in flushing snakes from cargo, equipment, airplanes, and other locations after dogs have given an indication that snakes are present.    Photo    Analytical Chemistry Methodology and Validation-- During FY 1998, NWRC chemistry personnel at Fort Collins developed and validated analytical chemistry methodology for the quantification of the candidate toxicant rotenone in brown tree snakes. The method limit of detection for rotenone in whole-body brown tree snakes was 0.017 mg per kg of body weight. Rotenone recoveries from snakes fortified with rotenone at 0.035, 4.82, and 250 mg/kg were 99.2, 87.8, and 85.6 percent, respectively. This is the third potential toxicant for which such previously unavailable methodology has been developed.    This methodology was then used to determine rotenone residues in snakes that were dosed orally or dermally with rotenone on Guam. For snakes dosed dermally with rotenone at 2.5-80 mg/snake, whole-body residues ranged from 2-31 mg/kg. The mean residue in fatally dosed snakes was 11.4 mg/kg. The mean residue in surviving snakes was 0.84 mg/kg. The lowest dermal dose of rotenone that killed all snakes was 10 mg/snake. The mean whole-body rotenone residue for these snakes was 5 mg/kg.    In an experiment to help determine dermal toxicity, snakes crawled through a soybean oil solution containing rotenone at 0.5 percent by volume. Whole-body residues ranged from 0.1 to 2.3 mg/kg. Mean residues in fatally dosed and surviving snakes were 2.0 and 0.09 mg/kg, respectively.    For snakes dosed orally with 10 mg rotenone in a quail chick, rotenone residues were extremely variable, and ranged from 0.68 to 61 mg/kg. Mean rotenone residues were 30 mg/kg. All snakes in this 10-mg-treated group survived. The implications of these data are that the toxicity to snakes of chemicals in a bait is different than when applied by gavage. That is, the carrier affects the toxicity of the chemical. Future research will be directed at improving toxicant delivery, possibly through encapsulation.    Improving Effectiveness of Dog Team Searches and Operational Trapping- -NWRC dog team and trap evaluation research is conducted with funds provided to WS' Washington State office and obtained from the DoD under its ""Operational Control of Brown Tree Snakes in Guam Program.""    BTS populations are controlled on Guam by WS personnel at civilian and military air- and seaport facilities and other cargo staging areas to curtail the snake's potential dispersal to other vulnerable locations. Three primary control methods are employed: trapping, detector-dog searches of cargo, and nighttime capture during spotlight searches of fencelines. NWRC has been investigating the efficacy of these control activities, and data have been collected and analyzed from the initial phases of the research.    Previous findings have indicated that trapping on plot perimeters is an efficient strategy that effectively removes brown tree snakes from such plots even in fragmented habitats. Trapping can virtually remove snake populations, and reinvasion is slow. Recent research investigated larger plot sizes for which perimeter trapping might be effective. A 17.1-ha plot was set with traps on its perimeter only for 22 weeks. Captures declined to very low levels after only 6 weeks. After the 22 weeks had passed, traps were positioned inside and around the edges of the plot for an additional 8 weeks. Only 5 snakes were captured in the interior. Perimeter trapping now appears to be effective for plots more than twice as big as those for which this strategy had previously been demonstrated effective (8 ha). This information is important to maximizing resources related to trapping efforts.    Research to quantify the effectiveness of dog-team inspections continued in FY 1998. In one study, snakes in escape-proof containers were placed in cargo without the knowledge of the handlers. When inspections were conducted using standard operating search patterns, most, but not all, planted snakes were discovered. These research efforts are directed at compiling a sufficiently large data base using trials with planted snakes to answer questions about inspection circumstances that increase or decrease the probability of finding a hitchhiking snake. Also, the reasons that snakes might be missed during inspections are being examined with the intent of minimizing the risk of this occurring.    Photo    Table of Contents         PROGRAM SUPPORT    APHIS Registration and Reregistration Status    Photo    Pesticides, Drugs, and Vaccines for Wildlife Services-- The WS program manages wildlife-human conflicts by using an integrated approach involving habitat manipulation, harassment, removal, repellants and/or vertebrate pesticides. Some of the chemical products employed in vertebrate control operations are used in such small volumes that private industry cannot afford to develop, register, and produce them profitably. APHIS has assumed the responsibility for maintaining registrations for some of these minor-use vertebrate pesticides, drugs, and vaccines, thereby ensuring that WS program managers will continue to have these necessary tools. The product development research program at NWRC is responsible for meeting the data requirements imposed by EPA for maintaining these products. Product development personnel regularly meet with EPA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) personnel to address registration issues for WS pesticides, drugs, and vaccines.    Vertebrate pesticides registered with EPA and maintained by APHIS include 7 active ingredients required in 25 to 30 individual end-use products and 1 Experimental Use Permit. The active ingredients in the APHIS-maintained vertebrate pesticide products include Compound 1080, used only in the Livestock Protection Collar; sodium cyanide, used only in the M-44 for controlling problem canines and foxes; sodium nitrate and carbon, used in the gas cartridge for controlling rodents, coyotes and foxes; DRC­1339 concentrates (Starlicide) used for controlling starlings, blackbirds, gulls, crows, ravens and pigeons; strychnine alkaloid for belowground pocket gopher control; and zinc phosphide baits and concentrates for rodent control.    APHIS has 2 vertebrate drugs registered with FDA for use by WS personnel. Alpha-chloralose is an orally delivered tranquilizer for removal or relocation of urban waterfowl and pigeons. Propiopromazine hydrochloride, another orally delivered tranquilizer, is used in a tranquilizer trap device to sedate animals caught in leghold traps or snares. FDA has also issued Investigative New Animal Drug authorizations to APHIS for two vaccines, GnRH and PZP, for use as immunocontraceptives in deer and other mammals. Refinement of the vaccines and delivery systems is continuing, and tests are planned for other mammals. NWRC has initiated discussion with FDA concerning three potential avian contraceptives, and preliminary testing with waterfowl may occur in 1999.    Reregistration Status and Activities-- The reauthorization of FIFRA in 1988 mandated reregistration of all older pesticides. All active ingredients registered by APHIS were subject to this requirement. NWRC efforts led to the successful reregistration of six active ingredients (carbon, sodium nitrate, sodium cyanide, Compound 1080, DRC-1339, and strychnine), and all but six data requirements for strychnine have been met. The six remaining studies for strychnine were completed by the end of 1998. A Reregistration Eligibility Decision was received in September 1998 for zinc phosphide, the only remaining APHIS-maintained vertebrate pesticide awaiting reregistration.    The Center's product development personnel coordinate 2 consortia to generate data required for reregistration of strychnine and zinc phosphide products held by private industry, State agencies, and APHIS. Additionally, NWRC coordinates a consortium for Starlicide products. These 3 consortia have the combined responsibility for more than 90 vertebrate pesticide registrations maintained by more than 30 registrants.    Registration Activities and New Pesticides and Uses- -Registration unit personnel have been active in providing data and technical support to allow APHIS to make label changes to existing vertebrate pesticide uses. Of particular interest to the WS program is reducing the length of the fallow period required following the use of DRC-1339 for blackbird control in rice-growing areas. With the cooperation of stakeholder groups, NWRC investigators initiated a study in 1998 to evaluate plant uptake of radio-labeled DRC-1339. The results of this study will determine if changes can be made to plant-back period restrictions for DRC-1339 for many use sites associated with cropland.    At the request of WS personnel, label changes have been initiated to expand the use of bait materials and methodology with some DRC-1339 uses. Work continued in 1998 on the registration of Mesurol, a chemical aversive agent, in eggs for reducing the predation on threatened and endangered species at nesting locations. This registration is expected in time for the 1999 breeding season.    Data Submissions and Reports-- NWRC is responsible for developing or obtaining all the data needed to meet APHIS and WS program and consortia commitments to EPA and FDA. The NWRC registration unit manages all data-gathering activities and coordinates these activities with the Data Support Team in APHIS' Policy and Program Development unit. During 1998, NWRC conducted, contracted, or prepared 16 data submissions for 6 vertebrate pesticides, 2 drugs, and 2 vaccines. In addition to the data submissions, NWRC also prepared 13 annual, semiannual, or quarterly reports concerning product use and countless product-related correspondence for EPA or FDA on behalf of WS, APHIS, or the consortia.    Pesticide and Drug Registration Files-- Three pesticide and drug registration data bases were developed by registration unit personnel. The Pesticide Registration File data base provides information on the status of individual data requirements for all APHIS or consortia vertebrate pesticides. A second cross-referenced bibliographic data base, on ProCite software, contains all known citations of published and unpublished information on 22 pesticides and drugs of interest to the WS program. This data base is complete through the early 1990's and is in the process of being updated. Finally, NWRC personnel continue to develop a DRC number data base. This searchable data base contains DRC numbers, chemical names, and Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers for 6,800 chemicals that were screened between 1960 and 1987 by NWRC for pesticidal properties. In addition, the data base indicates the type, quantity, and location of data developed by NWRC and provides access to summary or raw data for research purposes. The data referenced in the DRC number data base will reside in the NWRC archives and will be made available upon request.    Data Provided to State Regulatory Agencies and Cooperators-- NWRC personnel continue to interact routinely with the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CAL-EPA) to allow the use of APHIS pesticides to continue in that State. Other States are following in CAL-EPA's footsteps by requiring extensive data, which NWRC is providing on an as-requested basis. In addition, WS program personnel or cooperators often need access to, or summaries of, data produced by NWRC or others to include in environmental assessments, environmental impact statements, and in Section 7 consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. NWRC is the prime supplier of these data to the WS program and its cooperators, and often includes summaries and necessary interpretations. More than 100 significant requests were handled in FY 1998 by NWRC; most were partially or completely customized for the requester.    Tranquilizer Trap Device Handbook-- Registration unit personnel assisted WS' Operational Support Staff in developing the ""Tranquilizer Trap Device Handbook (Training, Use, and Restrictions)."" Training based on the contents of this manual is required for WS personnel before using the device.    Table of Contents            PROVIDING  WILDLIFE SERVICES  Photo    Goal: Provide high-quality wildlife damage management services that result in the protection of agricultural, wildlife, and other natural resources, property, and human health and safety.       NATIONAL SUPPORT    Vultures-- A biological technician from NWRC's Gainesville, FL, field station assisted WS operations in trapping and removing nuisance vultures in Leesburg, VA. The town of Leesburg, about 20 miles northwest of Washington, DC, has had up to 300 vultures roosting during the winter. The birds roost in only a few trees within the historic district, but their droppings and damage to the trees prompted the town to contract with WS to trap and remove the birds after local harassment efforts failed. Forty-three birds were trapped, tagged, and released along the western county line. The Florida field station has continued to evaluate the relocation of vultures as a management tool.    Experimental Aircraft Association Convention-- Biologists from NWRC's Sandusky, OH, field station worked at the APHIS-WS information booth at the Experimental Aircraft Association Convention in Oshkosh, WI, July 28-August 3 to promote the awareness and reporting of bird strikes. This annual air show is the largest gathering of pilots in the world, attracting over 800,000 visitors. WS' displays of photos on aircraft damaged by bird strikes and promotional material on reporting bird strikes were well received and drew many questions. The national bird strike data base maintained by NWRC is critical for defining the extent and nature of the wildlife problems to ensure that research and management programs to reduce strikes can be properly focused, justified, and evaluated.    American White Pelican Banding Project-- On June 27, 1998, NWRC biologists, with the assistance of WS personnel from Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and headquarters, banded immature American white pelicans in a nesting colony at Chase Lake, ND. WS and 30 volunteers from the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Resources Division, North Dakota State University, the North Dakota State Game and Fish Department, and St. Cloud State University banded 2,600 pelicans. NWRC is studying pelican migration and movement patterns to provide better information to catfish producers experiencing pelican damage and to the USAF for its bird-strike data base.    Photo    Master Gardeners Training-- NWRC provided training in wildlife damagemanagement to volunteers through the CSU extension program in June 1998. Master gardeners were trained to provide advice to homeowners regarding urban pest problems and given experience in trapping pocket gophers.    Beaver Repellent Studies in the Southern United States-- The 1996 WS Research Needs Assessment identified beaver damage problems as a critical research area. As a result, an NWRC scientist has worked with WS personnel in Mississippi to identify specific research objectives to increase and improve methods available to control beaver damage. Studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of several potential chemical repellants (capsaicin, denatonium saccharide, Thiram, and synthetic fermented egg) to deter beavers.    Results to date indicate limited to no avoidance of these chemicals by beaver. However, preliminary trials indicate that beaver damage to trees can be reduced by painting their stems with textural repellants using mixtures of sand and alkyd paint. Uncoated stems or stems coated only with paint were severely damaged during a 2-week trial, but stems coated with the sand-paint mixture received only minor damage.    Future research is being planned to assess the potential of a toxicant bait, another textural repellant, and a tension trigger for traps that would reduce nontarget captures. NWRC is also collaborating with WS to assess the efficacy of an artificial floating lodge trap developed by WS field personnel.    Evaluation of Tranquilizer Trap Device for Delivering Propiopromazine Hydrochloride to Coyotes Captured in No. 3 Soft-Catch Leghold Traps-- WS field personnel capture predators during operational control using leghold traps. The program is also called upon to trap and relocate endangered predators, such as wolves that are involved in livestock depredations. Trap humaneness and the inadvertent trapping of nontarget species are important issues both to the program and the public. To meet these concerns, the WS program requested development of a tranquilizer trap device. Modification of leghold traps by adding this device reduces foot damage, struggling, aggression, and escapes and eases the release of nontarget species, such as dogs.    As a result of this research effort, a tranquilizer trap device with the immobilizing drug propriopromazine is available from the Pocatello Supply Depot at $5.00 each. However, the high cost of this device has limited its use by WS personnel. Clearly, a more economical device is needed. NWRC and the Pocatello Supply Depot are conducting trials under simulated field conditions of a new device, the parts of which are commercially available. If effective, the savings would be significant to the program. If preliminary trials are successful, WS operations personnel will conduct field evaluations.    American Bird Conservancy Policy Council Meeting-- A biologist from NWRC's Mississippi field station presented a talk and participated in a panel discussion of fish-eating birds at the September policy council meeting of the American Bird Conservancy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection of wild birds and their habitats throughout the Americas. This group was formed in 1994 to coordinate collaborative approaches among bird conservation groups and to provide an accurate picture of avian conservation to the public.    A major focus of NWRC research at the Mississippi field station is the double-crested cormorant. Cormorants cause significant economic losses at southern aquaculture facilities, are a perceived threat to sport and commercial fisheries on northern lakes, cause major ecological destruction of their breeding habitat, and compete with other colonial water birds for nesting sites. An integrated management approach is needed to deal with the various issues surrounding cormorants in a comprehensive manner.    Buck Island Reef National Monument, U.S. Virgin Islands-- Biologists from WS' Alabama State office and NWRC assessed the rat populations at Buck Island Reef National Monument, U.S. Virgin Islands, at the request of the National Park Service from February 16 to 21, 1998. The introduced rats are preying on eggs and hatchlings of endangered sea turtles and least terns.    WS staff confirmed the presence of a substantial rat population over the entire island and extensive damage to native vegetation. WS biologists also confirmed the continued presence of a mongoose population, based on tracks, despite a Park Service eradication effort in the 1980's. WS and Park Service biologists developed a plan for a rat and mongoose monitoring and management program with the eventual goal of eradicating of both species from Buck Island. Eradication would be essential before a proposed reintroduction of the endangered St. Croix ground lizard could proceed.    Table of Contents         INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION    Bird-Aircraft Hazards in Mexico-- An NWRC biologist made a second trip to Mexico City in January 1998 to assist the Government of Mexico and the National University of Mexico in evaluating bird hazards at proposed sites for a new international airport. These consultations have been sponsored by the Mexican Ministry of Communication and Transport through an agreement with the FAA. Bird species hazardous to aviation, such as waterfowl and vultures, are common in the Mexico City region, and the Government of Mexico wants to ensure that its new airport is designed to minimize attractiveness to birds. Biologists have censused bird populations during fall and winter in wetland, agricultural, and landfill areas throughout the Mexico City valley and made recommendations not only to minimize bird strike hazards at the proposed airport sites but also to develop and enhance important wetlands away from the proposed sites. Such advance planning is essential for developing environmentally sound and efficient bird-hazard reduction programs for airports. Bird strikes are of particular concern in Mexico City because of the high elevation (about 7,400 ft) of the existing and planned airport sites.    Agricultural Bird Problems in Uruguay and Argentina-- An NWRC scientist from Fort Collins traveled to Uruguay and Argentina between March 23 and April 4, 1998, for the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization to assist both countries in finalizing a proposed project to address bird pests to agriculture. During this trip, a final technical report covering 15 external consultancies, a project document review, and 2 training courses were completed. The two governments are now determining how best to implement this important project: birds greatly affect agricultural production in both countries.    Foreign Agricultural Service Russian Research Grant-- NWRC was awarded a competitive research grant from the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service's Research and Scientific Exchange Division to fund a collaborative research study with Dr. Vera Voznessenskaya of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The study will evaluate the use of predator urine to control reproduction in rodents. Dr. Voznessenskaya visited NWRC in April 1998 to initiate this collaborative research effort.    Reducing the Leptospirosis Hazard in the Azores-- At the request of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service and DoD, an NWRC scientist visited the Azores Islands in the North Atlantic to assess the relationship between introduced rodent populations and the occurrence of leptospirosis bacterial infections and deaths in humans. The disease is probably contracted from water contaminated by rodent urine and feces and possibly from infected pets and livestock. The islands of the Azores offer abundant food, water, and shelter for rodents because of the mild climate, abundant rainfall, lush vegetation, volcanic rock formations, and extensive dairy cattle industry.    The scientist toured the island of Terceira and met with Portuguese veterinarians and government representatives. He presented an overview of rat biology, ecology, and management. In addition, he recommended that (1) the rodent populations be studied and monitored, (2) the availability of certain foods used by rodents (garbage, pet, and livestock feed) be reduced, (3) an effective rodent population reduction program be designed and implemented, and (4) the exposure hazard for people in high-risk occupations (such as dairy farmers) be lessened by the use of rubber gloves and disinfectants in pet and livestock water containers.    Galapagos National Park, Ecuador, Workshop-- An NWRC scientist participated in a planning workshop in the Galápagos National Park, Ecuador. The workshop focused on strategies for protecting critical habitats for giant tortoises on Isabela Island by removal of more than 100,000 feral goats whose population has grown drastically since introduction in 1979. Participants represented the Ecuador National Park Service, the Charles Darwin Foundation, Landcare Research (New Zealand), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, APHIS, and several private consulting companies.    The group spent several days visiting habitat areas (primarily rough lava with thick scrub forest vegetation), evaluating the existing program and several proposals and developing a draft plan and cost estimates for future use by the Ecuador National Park Service. Partial funding for this effort has been obtained, and a program to remove the goats will be implemented in the near future.    Rodent Pests in Mexican Sugarcane-- Dr. Beatriz Villa, from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico in Mexico City, visited the NWRC facilities in Fort Collins on October 8, 1997, to confer with NWRC scientists on rodent damage assessment, research, and control methods. Dr. Villa conducts research in Mexico on several rodent pest species that damage a variety of agricultural crops. She also presented a seminar entitled ""Rodent Pests in Mexican Sugarcane,"" which stressed the economic impact of damage and future plans for developing integrated control programs.    Dickcissel Damage in Venezuela-- The dickcissel is a small grassland bird that breeds in the Central United States and winters in Venezuela. In Latin America, damage to rice and sorghum by wintering dickcissels has been compared with damage caused by quelea birds in Africa and red-winged blackbirds in the United States. In Venezuela, where virtually the entire dickcissel population spends the winter, some farmers resort to using organophosphate pesticides to kill roosting birds as a means of protecting their crops.    A single roost can contain up to 3 million dickcissels, possibly 30 percent of the entire species population, and thus spraying with toxic pesticide could have a major impact on the world's dickcissel population. Such mortality probably was responsible for drastic declines in dickcissel breeding populations in the United States during the 1960's and 1970's.    Reducing the risk to this species means alleviating the economic pressure of crop losses on Venezuelan farmers. In June 1998, an NWRC biologist participated by invitation in a workshop in Acarigua, Venezuela, to develop strategies to reduce this conflict. The workshop was attended by local government wildlife officials, Venezuelan conservationists, agricultural experiment station and university personnel, and rice and sorghum producer organizations. In addition to the NWRC representative, participation from the United States included the American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and the Nature Conservancy.    An action plan was adopted that will address farmers' concerns in the short term and also provide for long-term management of wintering dickcissel populations. Implementation of the plan is contingent on obtaining cooperative financial support from participating organizations.    Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences-- An NWRC scientist and a biologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences are collaborating on field evaluations of more than 20 sampling methods that can be used for assessing animal damage to crops. Their approach has been to use fully enumerated field populations in large computer simulations to evaluate plotless density estimation methods.    National Autonomous University of Mexico-- NWRC continued collaborative consultation and research with investigators in Mexico City on studies of pocket gophers, which cause extensive agricultural losses in Mexico to sugarcane, grain crops, orchards, and forage on rangelands. Several manuscripts have been previously produced, and studies are continuing on a variety of topics concerning pocket gopher and other rodent damage problems in Mexico to several crops.    Dingo Assessments in Queensland, Australia-- An NWRC scientist is collaborating with zoologists from the Department of Natural Resources in the Queensland, Australia. The focus of this research is on dingo predation of livestock with an initial emphasis on evaluating methods for indexing wild canid populations. A passive tracking station was developed and found to be the most sensitive to the presence of wild canids. The station also is sensitive for indexing other species present in the area that may have population responses to changes in dingo populations. Monitoring dingo populations is an important component in the management of livestock losses, and research results could generate parallel applications for coyotes in the United States.    Table of Contents            VALUING AND INVESTING  IN PEOPLE  Photo    Goal: Promote an organizational culture which values and invests in our people to support their professionalism, competency, and innovation as Federal leaders of wildlife damage management.       ExCEL Program-- Geraldine McCann, a biological technician from NWRC, spent 2 weeks at the WS' Operational Support Staff headquarters in Riverdale, MD, in January 1998 to assist with assembling the annual WS highlights report. This detail was part of Ms. McCann's training in the APHIS ExCEL program. The goal of the program is to provide continual learning opportunities for selected individuals and to ensure that they gain or maintain the skills necessary to contribute effectively to the agency's mission and vision in times of change in the workplace. The new ExCEL program has been designed to be a flexible, competency-based training program offering a variety of training methodologies, both classroom and self-study, that can be tailored to the needs of the participants.    APHIS Leadership Today and Tomorrow Program Council-- Richard Bruggers, Assistant Director at NWRC, was selected to be a member of the APHIS Leadership Today and Tomorrow Program (LTTP) Council to help guide this APHIS initiative in developing skills in prospective future managers. He also is serving as a mentor to a Plant Protection and Quarantine participant in the LTTP.    Deputy Administrator's Award-- Richard Bruggers received the 1997 Wildlife Services Vision Award in recognition of strategic leadership of the NWRC. The award related to his leadership in conducting a WS Research Needs Assessment and developing and implementing the Project Management System within NWRC.    Graduate Degrees Awarded-- Two NWRC chemists recently obtained graduate degrees while completing NWRC research aiding the needs of the WS program. Bruce Kimball completed his Ph.D. requirements and successfully defended his dissertation, ""Chemical Ecology of Vascular Tissue Foraging by Black Bears,"" at CSU. His research provided the timber industry with a greater understanding of factors leading to black bear-induced timber losses as well as suggestions for modifying silvicultural practices as a nonlethal means of reducing damage. David Goldade completed his M.S. requirements and defended his thesis, ""Solid Phase Extraction/Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatographic Method for the Quantitation of the Rodenticide Difethialone in Biological Matrices,"" at the University of Colorado. The chemistry methods developed during these research efforts will permit NWRC to conduct secondary hazard studies required for EPA registration and subsequent use of a new rodenticide for wildlife damage management. The research for both degrees was partially supported by stakeholder funding.    Jack H. Berryman Award-- Retired NWRC employee Guy Connolly received the Jack H. Berryman Institute Award for Lifetime Career Contribution on March 3, 1998, at the 18th annual Vertebrate Pest Conference in Costa Mesa, CA. Connolly has had a distinguished research career with NWRC, working on a number of projects related to coyote depredation control, including the Livestock Protection Collar and the M­44 device. In addition to his numerous publications on coyote biology and management, Connolly has also published more than 30 papers on mule deer and Columbian black-tailed deer.    WS Safety Awards-- Ron Paciorek, a biological technician at the Starkville, MS, field station, received the FY 1997 WS Safety and Health Employee of the Year Award for his attention to safety and health matters, personal involvement in fitness and volunteer work, and for initiating and promoting appropriate safety training programs for the employees at his location.    NWRC's analytical chemistry unit was nominated for the FY 1997 Safety and Health Unit of the Year Award and received a Certificate of Appreciation. NWRC Denver and Fort Collins employees were nominated for an FY 1997 WS Special Achievement Award for the accident-free and safe commuting of 75 employees over 150,000 miles during a 3-year period and also received a certificate of appreciation.    Table of Contents       INFORMATION AND  COMMUNICATION  Photo    Goal: Collect and analyze internal and external information to monitor and enhance program effectiveness. Communicate internally and externally to accomplish our mission and to build an understanding of the Federal role in wildlife damage management       INFORMATION SERVICES    NWRC Library-- The NWRC library continued its commitment during 1998 to expand electronic access to publications and other research information. The NWRC Website was updated to enhance overall appearance and readability. Additions included new photos and text, the 1996 and 1997 NWRC highlights reports, annual publications lists for 1990-98, the NWRC brochure, and introductions to the various Center research programs with image map links to corresponding projects.    Library staff studied various options available for providing materials full-text on the Web and chose to implement use of Adobe's portable document format in order to make all 1998 Center publications available for downloading. An e-mail address was added to the home page to provide a direct contact point for our Web users, and the library began functioning as the referral point for all incoming e-mail.    Numerous publications needed distribution in 1998, and the library staff mailed out more than 400 copies of ""Contraception in Wildlife Management"" and 470 copies of the ""Repellents in Wildlife Management Proceedings."" In addition, 3,126 copies of the 1997 version of the present highlights report, the Center's Research Update newsletter, the new Center brochure, and the 1997 annual publications list were mailed.    To provide research and operations staff with needed information, Library staff requested more than 1,100 books and photocopies from other institutions and sent more than 360 items to outside requesters. More than 11,000 photocopies of inhouse library materials were made and distributed to various individuals and projects. Library personnel provided 265 literature searches on subjects such as corvid predation on shore birds, plant species with possible chemical repellent properties, deer and black bear damage, gull predation on salmon and trout, vulture control and ecology, and food habits of such species as the yellow bittern and the bullfrog. Library personnel also provided extensive citation searching on rodent species to aid WS Operations staff in compiling information for the rodent damage control and environmental assessments.    A Windows-based interface was purchased for the online catalog, as well as cataloging and serials software. To provide more immediate access to wildlife literature citations for WS end users, the library, on a trial basis, instituted limited Internet access to an online wildlife database. Response from users was overwhelmingly favorable, and NWRC will provide access to a larger number of users in FY 1999.    Archives-- Current research documents and historic material continued to be processed and added to the NWRC archives. Various quality assurance (QA) studies, pilot studies, lab notebooks, and chemical methods were archived. More researchers from outside NWRC made use of the Center's archive services. In 1998, eight requests for a wide variety of materials from the miscellaneous research collections were processed. Previously archived NWRC Animal Care Committee records were inspected by APHIS' Animal Care Program in 1998, and QA research records were audited by EPA in April.    Information on Stored Food Protection Going on the Internet-- The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is compiling ""Postharvest Compendium,"" a comprehensive book on postharvest food information that will be available on the World Wide Web. This book will be useful in the design, organization, or implementation of post-harvest programs, including technical assistance projects and applied research.    NWRC scientists produced a chapter for this electronic publication on the management of rodent, bird, and other vertebrate pests of farm-stored grains and legumes. The chapter presents an overview of reported losses by country and a brief account of the major pest species including rats, sparrows, pigeons, and crows. It also describes recognition of signs and damage of various species and basic approaches to reducing losses, including sanitation, prevention of pest access to foods, and population reduction strategies. Additional references and technical assistance sources are presented.    Postharvest food losses to vertebrates occur worldwide and can be especially severe in developing countries. As the world's human population continues to increase, the importance of stored food protection at the farm level can be expected to intensify.

The following selected activities show both the diverse nature of NWRC's research and its varied stakeholder and interest groups.    Wildlife Service State Meetings-- NWRC biologists made numerous presentations on predator management, bird-aquaculture research, bear damage research, and beaver damage to timber resources at various WS State and regional meetings in California, Colorado, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.    Wildlife and Their Impacts Workshop-- NWRC personnel conducted a 2-day workshop on wildlife and their impacts in Chewelah, WA, in October 1997, at the request of the Washington State University (WSU) Cooperative Extension. Participants were private timber producers looking for feasible approaches to alleviate wildlife damage to forest resources. The workshop provided information to more than 100 individuals on how to identify damage tn forest resources by bears, beavers, birds, deer, elk, jackrabbits, mountain beavers, pocket gophers, porcupines, snowshoe hares, and voles. A general overview of damage control techniques, such as barriers, behavior modification, habitat manipulation, repellants, rodenticides, and traps, was also presented. The workshop included time for the participants to discuss ongoing problems and case studies.    Experimental Aircraft Association Chapter 50 Meeting-- A biological technician of the NWRC Sandusky, OH, field station made a presentation entitled ""On a Wing and a Prayer, or a Better Way to Avoid Wildlife Strikes"" at the monthly meeting of the Experimental Aircraft Association Chapter 50 in Huron, OH, on October 5, 1997. The talk reviewed the consequences involved when aircraft collide with birds and deer and provided information on avoiding such interactions. The importance of completing the FAA Bird and Other Wildlife Strike Report Form was also emphasized.    Wildlife Damage Management for Natural Resource Managers Symposium-- The NWRC Olympia field station, the Collaborative Research Team, and the Western Forestry and Conservation Association sponsored a 2-day symposium on wildlife damage management for natural resource managers in October 1997. The symposium presented materials on means to alleviate wildlife damage to forest resources. About 140 participants from 8 States and Canada, representing a variety of State and Federal agencies as well as private companies, attended the event.    The first day included sessions on an overview of controls: why they work and how they function and management tools for animal damage. A session on implementing a damage prevention program was followed by field demonstrations and displays.    Displays provided information on the general biology, damage identification and damage management techniques for specific problem animals in the Northwest. Technical experts at each of these displays demonstrated techniques (e.g., problem identification, trapping, barriers) and answered questions. Other displays presented overview information on frightening devices (e.g, effigies, pyrotechnics), barriers, repellants, and supplemental feeding. Technical experts answered questions and offered advice on how and when these techniques could effectively be implemented.    Eighth Eastern Wildlife Damage Management Conference-- Biologists from NWRC field stations in Florida, Ohio, and Mississippi attended the eighth Eastern Wildlife Damage Management Conference in Roanoke, VA, in October 1997. They reported on research investigating the use of repellants to control wading-bird damage to commercial ornamental fish farms, electric fences to exclude herons from commercial trout hatcheries, nesting populations of great blue herons and great egrets in the United States and Canada, wildlife-caused losses for commercial catfish producers, and baits to control grackle damage to ripening citrus.    Agriculture Under Secretary Dunn's Visit-- Under Secretary of Agriculture Michael Dunn met with staff of the NWRC Hilo, HI, field station and other personnel from WS, Plant Protection and Quarantine, and Veterinary Services on October 31, 1997. Participants toured the facilities, viewed poster displays about field station activities, and were briefed about WS operations and research in Hawaii by WS staff from Honolulu and Hilo.    Ohio State University Students-- The NWRC Sandusky, OH, field station and Ohio WS program hosted 16 graduate and undergraduate wildlife biology students from Ohio State University at the 6,000-acre Plum Brook Station on October 10 and November 14, 1997. Students were given instruction in scientific method by collecting data to estimate the size of a deer population. In addition, field demonstrations and lectures on wildlife damage control techniques were provided. Speakers emphasized emerging conflicts between wildlife and people and the integrated research and management programs needed to resolve these conflicts. This is the 13th year the Ohio field station has hosted these field exercises to educate natural resource students about the importance of wildlife damage control as a key component of the wildlife profession.

Brown Tree Snake Research Symposium-- In July APHIS and the U.S. Geological Survey jointly sponsored the 1998 Brown Tree Snake Research Symposium in Honolulu. This symposium provided opportunities for researchers and managers to discuss research progress on the BTS. Topics included BTS biology; trapping strategies and snake movements; development of attractants, repellants, toxicants, and fumigants; barriers; snake detector dogs; and large-scale control. A concluding session provided managers the opportunity to present their perspectives on research progress and to identify important areas in which further work is needed. More than 100 personnel from research and management agencies (including 15 research and management personnel from WS) participated in the symposium.    International Bird Strike Committee Annual Meeting-- A wildlife biologist from the NWRC Ohio field station represented USDA and Bird Strike Committee-USA at the 24th meeting of the International Bird Strike Committee (BSC) in Stara Lesna, Slovakia in September. More than 100 scientists, military personnel, and representatives of the aviation industry from 26 nations met to discuss economic and safety issues related to bird collisions with aircraft. The new USDA-FAA bird strike reporting poster entitled ""Strike One--You're Out,"" which has been distributed to airports in the United States, was displayed and featured on Slovakian television news coverage of the conference. In addition, the employee presented a paper, based on a 7-year study at Kennedy Airport, in New York, comparing the effectiveness of falconry and the shooting of gulls to reduce bird collisions with aircraft. The paper concluded that, although falconry has received considerable positive publicity in the media, there has been no statistical evidence of a reduction in strikes attributed to falconry. In contrast, shooting has received negative publicity but has resulted in a significant reduction in strikes. The speaker reinforced the obligation of scientists to be leaders in ensuring that the public has factual information regarding the effectiveness of wildlife control techniques.    Wildlife Society Annual Meeting-- Nine NWRC scientists and two Center-sponsored graduate students attended the Wildlife Society's fifth annual conference in Buffalo, NY, in September. Several NWRC scientists participated in the full-day workshop on the status and future of wildlife fertility control, made six presentations and served on the panel discussion session. The workshop was well attended, and an informative workbook that included abstracts and reprints from scientific literature was provided to participants. In contributed paper sessions, 4 scientists presented 4 papers on carnivore ecology and management, wildlife-airport issues, and the ecological consequences of introduced wildlife species. One scientist moderated a session on wildlife damage and policy and advised students in a special session on Federal employment opportunities. Scientists also participated in Wildlife Society working group meetings and a Rabies Task Force meeting. The conference was attended by more than 1,000 biologists and resource managers from around the world and provided an outstanding forum for interaction.    Australian Vertebrate Pest Conference-- An NWRC scientist presented a paper in May entitled ""Efficacy of the Methods Used in an Integrated Program To Deter the Dispersal of Brown Tree Snakes from Guam"" to this international conference of researchers, managers, and operational personnel involved in reducing wildlife damage.

GX037-26-13458503	"The Arm of Conservation Law Gets Longer    Would you shoot a deer out of season if you knew you could be fined $500? Some poachers consider this nothing more than the cost of doing business. But what if you knew that violating game laws here could cost you your Colorado elk hunt? That's exactly the choice now facing hunters in Missouri and 11 other states.    Missouri recently joined the Interstate Wildlife Violator's Compact, an agreement that allows participating states to track poachers' activities throughout the compact area. In the past, a poacher whose hunting, fishing or trapping privileges were suspended in one state could simply cross a state line and be back in business. Now, if your privileges are revoked in Missouri they can and almost certainly will be revoked in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.    The Conservation Department already has a long list of violators whose privileges have been revoked in other compact states. Following action by the Missouri Conservation Commission to revoke their privileges here, their names will be flagged in Missouri's automated permit issuing system, making it impossible for them to purchase permits anywhere in the state. Similarly, several Missourians who have lost their hunting, fishing or trapping privileges here may find themselves shut out of the other 11 compact states.    Each state retains its own criteria and procedures for privilege suspension. In Missouri, violators receive notice that the Conservation Commission is considering revoking their privileges and can request hearings to contest the action.    Ironically, some violators will benefit from the compact. Instead of requiring all out-of-state violators to post bonds, conservation agents will have the option of issuing citations and releasing them.    Conservation Federation of Missouri Confers Conservation kudos    The late Ford Hughes, who became one of Missouri's best-loved conservation figures through decades of professional and citizen service, posthumously received the Conservation Federation of Missouri's (CFM) highest honor. His widow, Betty Lu Hughes, accepted the award at the annual CFM convention March 25 at Lake of the Ozarks.    Hughes died Nov. 23 at age 77. His professional career included 32 years with the James Foundation, where he supervised the planting of 35,000 trees. He also served in many offices and on committees with the CFM and the Missouri Parks and Recreation Association.    Other winners of CFM awards include:        Air Conservationist   of the Year, John A. Young, director of the Div. of Environmental   Quality for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR).     Water Conservationist   of the Year, Ben Knox, chief naturalist and environ mental services   officer for the St. Louis County Department of Parks.     Conservation Communicator   of the Year, Gene Fox, Kansas City metro media specialist for   the Missouri Department of Conservation.     Conservation Educator   of the Year, the Pike County Soil and Water Conservation District.     Professional Conservationist   of the Year, Ken McCarty, chief of natural resources management   for the DNR's Division of Parks.     Forest Conservationist   of the Year, Jim Drew of Caldwell County.     Wildlife Conservationist   of the Year, Continental Cement Company of Hannibal.     Hunter Education   Instructor of the Year, James A. Ragland of Florissant.           Centennial Forests: The Beginning of Fire Prevention (1940s)    In 1938, the newly appointed Conservation Commission hired former Forest Service employee George O. White as state forester. His first big job was fire control. Before deer and turkey could be restocked, and before the Ozark streams could run clear, the wildfires had to be stopped.    Money was tight, and equipment was scarce. Each district forester was issued a pickup truck, an ax, a one-man crosscut saw, a long-handled shovel, a dozen council rakes and a couple of backpack water pumps. Fire detection depended on a few scattered lookout towers, word of mouth and a sense of smell.    Education was the key. White borrowed an earlier idea and put the Conservation Department ""showboat"" back in operation. This was a truck with a generator, movie screen and projector that took forestry movies into the Ozark hills where there was no electricity. Foresters showed the movies in schools, general stores and churches-anywhere they could get a group of people together.    White also encouraged tree planting on private land. He believed that if someone invested time and sweat in planting seedlings, they weren't going to let their trees burn.    In 1944, a black bear cub was found in the aftermath of a forest fire in New Mexico. His rescuers decided to name the cub Smokey and make him a symbol of forest fire prevention. Thus began one of the most successful public awareness campaigns ever launched.    The education efforts paid off; the once impossible task of fire control in the Ozarks now is a reality. Today less than one-tenth of 1 percent of Missouri burns each year, wildlife abounds, and the streams run clear again.-Bruce Palmer    Monster Prairie Chicken Accompanies Lek Trekkers    Planning continues for the 565-mile ""Lek Trek"" across western Missouri. The event now has a larger-than-life mascot-Boomer the prairie chicken-and more communities and conservation groups are getting involved to improve Missouri's grassland resources.    The greater prairie chicken is one of hundreds of unusual and beautiful plants and animals that depend on prairie habitat. Boomer, the prairie equivalent of Smokey Bear, will appear at most Lek Trek events.    Lek Trekkers will kick off the event July 21, heading south from the Missouri-Iowa border near Hatfield. A second group will begin a northward trek from the Arkansas border near Southwest City Sept. 23. The two groups will rendezvous Oct. 14 at Prairie State Park near Lamar.    In between, participants will tour unspoiled prairie, learn about prairie ecology and take part in a variety of natural- and cultural-history events. They also will raise money pledged in return for completing trek segments.    To learn more, visit the event's Web site at www.lektrek.org, or contact the Lek Trek office, 315 Lawrence St., Kansas City, MO 64111, phone 816/561-8735.

Deer Trapping Effort Still Short of Goal    An effort to control deer numbers in a St. Louis suburb by non-lethal means fell short of its goal for the second year.    Town and Country received permission from the Conservation Commission to live-trap and relocate deer to a rural area, to reduce deer-related automobile accidents and property damage.    Using mathematical population models, Conservation Department biologists estimated that Town and Country would need to remove 122 female deer per year two or three years in a row to reduce the deer population to the desired size. After that, city officials would have to remove a smaller number each year to maintain an acceptable deer population.    The first year of the program, a contract trapper removed 51 does. This year the trapper removed 44 does. No effort was made to track the survival of relocated deer this year. Of the deer trapped the first year, one in five died within a few months of relocation. The primary factor in these fatalities was capture myopathy, a neural condition resulting from the stress of trapping and relocation. A significant number of relocated deer were taken by hunters.    Best Turkey Season Ever    No matter how you measure it, the 2000 spring turkey season was the best on record. Hunters bagged a record 30,440 gobblers during the first week of the season, topping the previous first-week record by 7,785. They ran the total up to 46,659 during the second week of spring turkey hunting, and by the end of the third week they had checked 65,841 turkeys. That's 6,503 more than the previous record, which was set last year.    Missouri turkey hunters also continued to improve their safety record. Only four accidents marred the three-week season, and all the injuries were minor. Missouri has averaged nearly 14 spring turkey hunting accidents per year since 1985. While four injuries is four too many, the improvement is a good sign.    Fine weather played an important role in this year's record spring turkey kill. Rainy weather keeps hunters out of the woods, and windy conditions make the birds spooky, but there was little of either during the April 24 through May 14 season. The continued growth of the state's turkey flock also contributed to the record harvest. Wild turkey nest success was 37 percent above average in 1998, providing lots of mature gobblers for hunters to pursue this year.    The top counties were Franklin with 1,236 turkeys checked, Macon with 1,100 birds killed and Texas with 1,086 harvested. Northeastern Missouri posted the largest regional turkey harvest, with 9,944 turkeys checked, followed by northwestern Missouri with 8,722 and the west-central region with 8,331 birds bagged.    Although last year's turkey nest success was above average, only about one in five turkeys killed this spring were yearlings. That bodes well for the 2001 spring turkey season. It promises a continued plentiful supply of 2-year-old birds, which account for the majority of each year's harvest.    The number of spring turkey hunting accidents peaked in 1986, when two hunters died and 29 others were injured during the two-week season. That prompted the Conservation Department to launch an intensive turkey hunting safety campaign that included news releases, magazine articles, a hunter safety video and a ""Be Safe"" sticker for hunters to put on their guns to remind them of safety. The number of spring turkey hunting accidents began its rapid decline in 1988, when it became mandatory for persons born after Dec. 31, 1966 to pass a hunter education course.

His job is to walk every trail on conservation areas (CAs) statewide. So far he has covered about half of the 500-plus miles of trails and says boredom is nowhere in sight.    Reeves, a natural history biologist for the Conservation Department, is gathering trail information for use in future editions of Missouri's Conservation Atlas and to help with trail signing, maintenance and development. The inventory won't be finished until some time in 2001, but it's already clear that no Missourian lives more than 45 minutes from a nature walk. That's nice to know, since June is National Trails Month.    In the St. Louis area, you can celebrate the event at Rockwoods Reservation. This area near Glenco has 10 miles of trails. Kansas City area residents might want to visit James A. Reed Memorial CA during National Trails Month. This 2,456-acre area near Lee's Summit has 18 miles of trails. In the Springfield area, try Little Sac Woods CA near Willard, which boasts six miles of trails. Conservation Nature Centers in St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield and Jefferson City all offer extensive networks of developed trails, many of them accessible to people with mobility impairments.    To learn more about hiking trails on CAs, check out Conservation Trails: A Guide to Missouri Department of Conservation Hiking Trails. The 91-page booklet easily fits into a day pack and contains maps of hundreds of miles of trails at 40 CAs. It's available for $5.25 plus $2 shipping and handling from The Nature Shop, Missouri Department of Conservation, P.O. Box 180, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0180. Missouri's Conservation Atlas lists every CA in the state. It's available for $15.93 plus $5 shipping and handling from the same address.    Big Cat's Origin Remains a Mystery    Genetic testing failed to reveal the origin of mountain lion remains found in Texas County. The mystery of how it how it came to rest alongside a gravel road may have been solved, though.    A deer hunter discovered the pelt of the mountain lion, with head and paws attached, beside a road in southern Texas County in November1998. Given occasional sightings of mountain lions in Missouri, the Conservation Department wanted to know if the animal was native and if it was wild or an escaped pet or zoo specimen.    Conservation Department officials had hoped a DNA test would show whether the cat was closely related to those living in other states. However, researchers concluded that the various North American mountain lion populations are too closely related to be distinguished by such genetic testing.    The question of how the cat died is less difficult. X-rays showed its skull contained a spent .22 caliber bullet. This matches the cause of death of a mountain lion that two men admitted killing several years ago. That animal's carcass was never recovered. Furthermore, the pelt found along the road showed signs of having been frozen for several years.    Apply Now For Managed Deer Hunts    Paper forms and stamps disappear from the managed deer hunt application process this year. This year's applications will be handled through the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system inaugurated last year for waterfowl reservations. Beginning July 1, hunters can apply for Missouri's 53 managed deer hunts by calling 800/829-2956 between 4 a.m. and midnight seven days a week or by visiting the Conservation Department's web page, www.conservation.state.mo.us.    You will need a 2000 Fall Deer and Turkey Hunting Information booklet, available July 1 wherever hunting permits are sold. It contains application instructions and a complete list of managed deer hunts. You must use a touch-tone telephone to apply by phone.    At the conclusion of the process, applicants will receive confirmation numbers. Successful hunters will be notified of their selection by mail. Most will receive this notification by Sept. 10. After that date, applicants can check the status of their applications on the IVR system or the Conservation Department Web page using their confirmation numbers.    Only Resident Managed Deer Hunt Permits ($15) and Nonresident Managed Deer Hunt Permits ($125) are valid for managed deer hunts. These permits were not required at Fort Leonard Wood in 1999, but they are this year. The number of deer that may be taken with a single permit depends on the hunt for which they are issued. In some hunts, up to three deer may be taken. Youth deer hunt applications will be handled on paper, as in the past. You can't apply for a youth deer hunt via internet or the IVR system. See the 2000 Fall Deer and Turkey Hunting Information booklet for details.    HABITAT HINTS    The Benefits of a Slow Burn    Carefully controlled burning can rejuvenate forests, prairies and glades by mimicking the effects of fires that have been part of natural systems in Missouri for thousands of years. ""Prescribed"" burning isn't done randomly but at carefully chosen times and places with specific goals.    Most common are spring burns, usually conducted in February or March, before plants green up. These help control woody plants that otherwise can take over prairies and glades. But late-summer burns offer advantages and can help meet certain management goals. Whereas spring burns strongly favor warm-season grasses, a prescribed burn in August encourages wildflowers and other non-woody plants that enhance the variety of food and cover available to wildlife.    Summer fires move slower and produce less heat than spring burns, but they control smooth sumac, sericea lespedeza and other plants better than spring burning. Two or three burns over the course of five or six years may be necessary to control undesirable plants.    Never conduct a burn without proper training and equipment, and always alert fire officials in your area first. For information about prescribed burning, contact your nearest Conservation Department office and talk to a private land conservationist.    Knowledge is Power . . . and Safety    Accidental firearms fatalities in Missouri have decreased 22 percent since 1987, according to the National Safety Council (NSC). The state's improved firearms safety record contributed to a nationwide decrease in accidental firearms deaths, which are at their lowest level since record keeping began in 1903.    In 1987, the NSC recorded 37 fatal firearms accidents in Missouri, 12 of which were hunting accidents. In 1996, the most recent year for which state-by-state statistics are available, Missouri had 29 fatal firearms accidents, including one hunting fatality. Nationwide, 33 states recorded declines in accidental firearms fatalities during the 10-year period.    State and national officials attribute the long-term improvement in firearms safety-despite increasing gun ownership-to firearms training and hunter education programs. The number of fatal firearms accidents nationwide reached an all-time low of 900 in 1998. By comparison, 2,513 Americans died in firearms accidents in 1974.    NSC figures for 1998 showed the accidental firearms death rate was lower than the death rate from falls (16,600), poisoning (9,000), drowning (4,100) or choking (3,200). Of the 900 accidental deaths due to firearms in 1998, 700 occurred in the home.    Big River Fishing Boom    East Central Missouri's Big River should offer good angling for rock bass and smallmouth bass this spring and early summer, according to the Conservation Department's Fishing Prospects at Selected Missouri Lakes and Streams 2000.    Fisheries biologists found an abundance of 7- to 9-inch rock bass when they sampled the river last fall. The report also cited good fishing for smallmouth bass, especially in Big River's special management area (SMA). ""Good numbers of 12- to 17-inch smallmouth exist,"" the report notes. ""Fall 1999 electrofishing surveys showed smallmouth up to 20 inches.""    The Big River's black bass SMA now extends from the Highway 21 bridge near Washington State Park, southwest of De Soto, downstream to the Meramec River confluence. The daily limit is six black bass, only one of which can be a smallmouth. Minimum length limits are 15 inches for smallmouth and 12 inches for largemouth. There is no length limit for spotted (Kentucky) bass.    For a copy of the report, write to ""Fishing Prospects"" Missouri Department of Conservation, P.O. Box 180, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0180.    Your Direct Line To St. Louis Fish Stocking Info    The St. Louis area's popular Fish Stocking Hotline is back in business, but this time it's a direct line. Just dial 636/441-8014 and up-to-date fish stocking information for the St. Louis Urban Fishing Program (UFP) is yours 24 hours a day, seven days a week.    The hotline tells callers when the last UFP stocking took place and the size, number, kind and locations of fish stocked.    The St. Louis Urban Fishing Program is the oldest and largest urban fishing program in the nation. The Conservation Department-run UFP, which began in 1969, stocks more than 20 St. Louis City and County park lakes each year with carp (March), channel catfish (April through October) and, for some lakes, trout (November through February). - Kevin J.

GX033-20-11758281	"Kentucky Afield Magazine   Fall, 2000 Issue   ""Stop the Falls""  by Carolyn Hughes Lynn   Proper use of safety gear can keep hunters in their tree stands.     It was raining at dusk the sixth day of Kentucky’s 1999 modern firearms deer hunting season when Wildlife-Boating Officer Dennis Davis discovered the hunter. He lay immobile on his back, his head pointing down an Owen County hill. The 78-year-old complained of severe abdominal pain and Officer Davis noticed the man’s extremities showed early signs of hypothermia. Fifteen feet away stood a forked oak tree with a homemade tree stand. A loaded rifle with its stock broken lay beneath the stand. The officer shuddered at the sight.   The victim, a seasoned hunter, had not been wearing a safety harness or belt when he fell 15-18 feet from his stand. After a summoned rescue squad evaluated the man’s condition, a Medi-Vac unit transported him to a hospital. The hunter has made a valiant recovery but remains paralyzed.   Three days prior to this incident, Davis was on the scene after a 44-year-old male hunter lost his grip while climbing down from his factory-made tree stand and fell onto a lower tree limb. Resulting injuries included a dislocated shoulder and torn cartilage. The victim, certified in hunter education, was airlifted to a Cincinnati hospital.   Day seven of the hunting season, Officer Davis was writing yet another incident report involving a fall from a tree stand. A 26-year-old male, who had failed to use safety gear, received a broken tailbone and was flown to a hospital for treatment.   In 1998, Kentucky wildlife-boating officers reported nine falls from tree stands. Four people died, two from broken necks.   L. J. Smith, a former longtime administrator of Mississippi’s Hunter Education Program and a past president of the International Hunter Education Association, is an expert witness in state and federal courts involving shooting incidents that occur during hunting seasons. Smith says, ""More accidents occur with tree stands than with firearms during hunting.""   Scary, huh? And just think, falls from tree stands don’t have to happen.   Harness Up     Hunters can prevent falls associated with tree stands by properly preparing equipment, wearing an anchored safety harness in the stand and following all safety rules. Mac Lang, hunter education administrator for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, says the best safety equipment for hunting from trees is a ""parachute-type"" harness that will catch a falling person before leaving the stand. This kind of harness fits around the torso with a big ""X"" of durable material on the chest, with a band running under the arms and another around the waist. Some designs include shoulder straps and leg openings. Lang says hunter education administrators across the nation currently recommend a ""four-point"" harness or better (""four-point"" refers to stitching points). A short tether runs from the back of the harness to a safety ""anchor"" the hunter places around a tree, above the wearer’s head.     Melinda Driskell and Mac Lang demonstrate 1) gearing up and checking hunting safety equipment while on the ground;  2) proper use of safety gear and correct attire for deer hunting while in a tree stand; and 3) while turkey hunting  from a tree stand.     Other experts agree with Lang. The NRA advises, ""Always use a safety harness when hunting from tree stands."" A properly worn and attached safety harness is the best safety gear to keep a hunter in a tree stand.   What about safety belts? Certainly, they are better than not wearing any safety gear. However, during a fall, some safety belts can slip upward and tighten around the chest or even pin the arms overhead. Hanging in either position greatly restricts breathing. Hunters have been found dangling a few feet below their tree stands, dead from suffocation. Safety gear is no place for a hunter to skimp.   ""Seat O The Pants"" is a fanny pack-style combination belt and safety harness designed for easy wear, even while driving a vehicle. Prices range from $54.99 to $69.99, depending on the type of camo a hunter chooses. The product is only available factory direct from Fall Woods, Inc., P. O. Box 6683, Huntsville, AL 35824; phone: 1-800-241-5559.   Prepare & Prevent     Preseason is the best time for hunters, especially novices, to practice with equipment and test skills. Inspect all tree stand equipment and safety gear. Check stress points. Look for broken or missing parts and repair or replace anything defective.   Now it’s time to practice with the equipment. Choose an appropriate sized tree near home and test the stand. In Kentucky, hardwood trees with rough bark are good choices for practice and during hunting. For factory-built portable stands, follow the manufacture’s instructions to the letter and heed any cautions listed. Position the stand only slightly off the ground (two or three feet). The safest entry into a hanging tree stand is to step down onto the platform from above. Make sure the platform remains level while you’re standing on it.   Once in the stand, test yourself. Excessive movement can cause a hunter to lose balance. Control and watch each step you make right down to anchoring your safety harness. (If you don’t own a safety harness, consider purchasing the best one you can afford.)   When you’re ready to set up in the field, remember this rule: Safety gear is the first thing to put on and the last to take off when hunting from a tree stand. While on the ground and before climbing, put on your safety harness and keep it on until both feet are safely on the ground again. More falls occur during the climb and descent that at any other time when using a tree stand. Also, take your time and concentrate on what you are doing, especially when descending to go locate your kill. It’s okay to be excited; just remember where you are and what you have to do to get down safely. Some hunters have actually stepped off the stand platform.   Always use a climb rope and  never  climb with anything in your hands. Use a haul rope to raise and lower unloaded guns or bowhunting equipment (with broadheads covered and no arrows nocked). A soft gun case will protect an unloaded gun from scarring, plus running a haul rope around the bundle and securely tying it to the case’s handle will make easier lifting and lowering.     A haul rope is the only safe means of moving unloaded firearms and archery equipment  from ground to tree stand and vice versa.   Other safety tips include wearing proper clothing for weather conditions and staying alert. Falling asleep in an elevated stand is asking for disaster. Also, be sure your family knows where you will be hunting and when you expect to arrive home. This may involve drawing a simple map. It’s a good idea to leave hunt location information in your vehicle, too, even when hunting with a partner. Some hunters have saved their lives by taking such simple measures.   You are responsible for your own safety. Check gear before and after every use in the field. Follow the tips in this article and use common sense. Hunters who properly prepare and take careful steps with tree stands can help ensure a safe return home. Let’s stop the falls.   Stand Types     Elevated stands come in four basic types – strap-on, climber, ladder and tower. Few, if any, Kentucky hunters use a tower stand because the land has so much natural cover. Portable strap-on stands seem to be the popular choice. When purchasing a tree stand, look for a sticker marked Tree Stand Manufacturers Association. It means the product has passed industry test standards.   Disabled hunters may want to check into the special equipment Wright Manufacturing, Inc., makes. The Louisiana company produces patented hydraulic and hand-cranked tree stands ""to give the joys of hunting back to the elderly and handicapped"".  For more information, write P. O.

There is no charge.      Blackpowder Certification Course Available    At its March 1999 meeting, the Alaska Board of Game created a new regulation requiring hunters who participate in the Fort Richardson muzzleloader-only moose hunt to successfully complete a certification course before hunting. The Board passed the new regulation at the urging of many muzzleloading rifle hunters and groups. Everyone agreed that muzzleloader hunters, particularly those new to this traditional hunting tool, should learn the special safety practices needed when using blackpowder, and the range limitations of muzzleloaders when used on Alaska big game.    To prepare for this new certification course, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game  Hunter Information and Training Program  sponsored a National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association instructor training session during the month of July. Volunteer instructors from Fairbanks to the Kenai Peninsula attended the three-day instructor training course, and more than a dozen new instructors were certified.    Alaska's first certification courses were held in July and August for the winners of the coveted Fort Richardson muzzleloader-only moose permits. Every permit winner was personally contacted by Elaine Larimer, administrative clerk for the HIT Program, and was scheduled to attend one of the new certification courses.     According to Tony Monzingo, co-coordinator of the HIT program, the new certification program will involve approximately 10 to12 hours of instruction over two days. The first session of the certification course involves principles of firearm safety, special precautions needed when handling blackpowder, and proper loading and unloading of muzzleloader. Knight Muzzleloading, a partner with the HIT Program in the Mobile Target Sports Trailer, provides a variety of muzzleloaders for the students.     HIT Program instructors recommend that no one use a firearm that does not have a mechanical safety. Almost all of the muzzleloaders that copy designs from the 1700s and 1800s have no safety mechanism at all. These replica designs have a hammer that must be cocked before the rifle is fired. If you see a game animal, cock the rifle, and then move for a clear shot, the hammer must be uncocked or you have to move with a fully cocked and loaded firearm.     The MK-85 Knight muzzleloading rifles used in the certification course are in-line design, which means the percussion cap fits directly behind the powder charge. Knight MK-85's have two safety devices. First is a knurled knob, not unlike what many of us remember on single-shot .22s of our youth. This knurled knob must be pulled back until it locks in place. This cocks the bolt but the rifle has a back-up mechanical safety. A small lever on the receiver must be pivoted forward into the fire position. Only after cocking the bolt and moving the safety to fire can the trigger be pulled. Monzingo says that no one should rely on any mechanical safety to replace basic firearm safety principle of keeping the muzzle pointed in a safe direction. Although mechanical devices cannot guarantee safety, the double safety design of the Knight may well make it the safest muzzleloader currently available.     Participants also learn that muzzleloaders are very short range hunting tools and shots at big game animals should be limited to 100 yards or less. Instructors stress the fact by limiting the practical range of hunting tools such as muzzleloaders and bows, can be very important to game managers when trying to preserve hunting opportunity in urban and near-urban areas.     The second session of the certification course is almost entirely hands-on. Every student is encouraged to load and shoot as many rounds as necessary to master the loading sequence and prepare for the shooting proficiency test. Emphasis of this session is on practicing correct, safe loading procedures and marksmanship practice at bull's eye targets. Candidates for certification are provided the opportunity to load and fire both round-ball and conical bullet loads so they can compare their performance and accuracy.   Hunters attending the certification class are given the chance to use Hodgdon Powder Company's Pyrodex®, a blackpowder substitute. Blackpowder is an explosive and subject to rigid shipping requirements. For Alaskan hunters it is easier and less expensive to purchase and use Pyrodex®. Course instructors demonstrate for the class that Pyrodex® works just as well as traditional blackpowder. Pyrodex® has a higher ignition temperature than blackpowder so hunters are encouraged to use hot percussion caps such as the CCI #11. Knight® also makes two other muzzleloader designs of interest to Alaskan hunters. First is the “Disc” rifle, which uses a plastic disc to hold either a shotgun primer or a percussion cap. A shotgun primer helps ignite the Pyrodex® powder in the temperatures of a late moose season. The other Knight® design of interest is the T-Bolt® rifle. The T-Bolt® has a bolt handle that is pulled straight to the rear. When pulled all the way to the rear a hot musket cap can be inserted behind the powder charge. When pushed forward the bolt almost completely encloses the musket cap, helping protect it from rain and snow.    After the demonstration and range practice, everyone takes the shooting proficiency test. This field test requires the muzzleloading student to shoot from a hunting position and hit an 8-inch bull's eye target four out of five times at 50 yards. With the concentrated practice and coaching, almost everyone passes with flying colors. In fact, instructors say “look out moose” as many targets come back with all five bullets in the black bull's eye.     Now everyone takes the written exam. The paper and pencil exam is multiple choice and is not a push-over. However, instructors are careful to emphasize the key points of the course that will be tested so almost everyone passes the first time. Students who do not pass the shooting proficiency or written exam may try again the next day.     At the present time there are three permit draw hunts limited only to muzzleloaders or muzzleloaders and bowhunters. Hunters interested in hunting with a muzzleloader may apply for one of 25 permits offered for a September-to-November moose hunt on Fort Richardson, near Anchorage. A second drawing permit hunt is offered in Game Management Unit 20A, south of Fairbanks, for a November bull moose hunt. About 75 permits are usually available for this hunt. The third opportunity for muzzleloader hunters is the elk drawing permit hunt in Game Management Unit 3. Approximately 70 permits are awarded for this island hunt in the southeastern rain forest.    If you are interested in becoming a muzzleloader hunter or applying for any of the muzzleloader only hunts, call the Hunter Information and Training Program at 267-2534 for information on future certification courses.    Top of Document       Hunter Education in Alaska: A Brief History     The history of wildlife-agency-administered education courses designed to reduce firearms-related hunting accidents extends back to 1949, when New York became the first state to institute a “hunter safety” course. Over the years course standards were developed cooperatively by the states and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Concurrently, the name of the program evolved from hunter safety to hunter education or outdoor skills or outdoor recreation, reflecting the broadening scope of topics covered in these courses. Alaska's voluntary program started in 1973 and continues today, primarily because of the work of hundreds of volunteer instructors. Over time the course became mandatory in many states. In 1997, 49 of the 50 states required the course, with Alaska the lone exception. In February of 1997, the process to change that was begun.    At that time, Wildlife Conservation Division Director Wayne Regelin established a citizen advisory group to craft a new program for Alaska. His primary goal was to insure that all groups and affected interests had a voice in the development of this plan. Eight citizens were ultimately selected to serve on the advisory group: Dave Cline–Anchorage, Del Demeritt–Fairbanks, Dan Kittoe–Anchorage, Eddie Grasser–Palmer, Mel Hein–Palmer, Sarah Jones–Soldotna, Orville Lind–King Salmon and Ted Schenck–Sitka. These eight individuals represented hunters, nonhunters, guides, conservation groups, sportsmen's groups, teachers, private business owners, Alaska Natives, contractors, government agency employees, women, rural and urban life, pilots, advisory committees, and volunteer hunter education instructors. John Matthews and Tony Monzingo, co-coordinators of the Hunter Information and Training Program, served as staff to this group and Teri Arnold, staff strategic planning facilitator, kept the group on task.   The group agreed that the primary goal of hunter training was to “put more ethical hunters in the field.” Given that goal, the group agreed to develop the best program possible. They spent hours reviewing public surveys and hunting-related accident data. Two reports played a key role in determining the content of the final proposal developed by the group: “Factors Related to Hunting, Participation in the United States – Responsive Management,” 1995, and the “Annual Accident Report of the International Hunter Education Association,” 1996. After extensive discussion the group felt that hunting and the hunter were best served by a comprehensive course focusing on safety, wildlife conservation, hunter responsibility and behavior and competency.    One of the more contentious elements of the initial proposal included a provision for renewal of certification every 10 years. Based upon accident data they reviewed, they found that the average age of a hunter involved in a fatal hunting accident was 30 years old and had 19 years of hunting experience. It was clear that hunters needed a refresher. When the initial proposal was distributed for review, two groups, the Alaska Outdoor Council and the National Rifle Association, voiced strenuous objection to this provision, fearing that such a requirement would place an undue burden on hunters. Concern over such reaction led to the removal of this provision from the plan.   It is important to note, however, that there is good reason to adopt this requirement. Nationwide there are approximately 100 fatal hunting accidents each year (actually in the past few years it has been in the high 90s). Today there are approximately 16 million hunters in the United States. That figures out to be .6 fatalities per 100,000 hunters. Alaska has 100,000 licensed hunters. In the past three years we have had between three and five fatalities per year. That's five to eight times the national average! Hunters have a responsibility to demand better. It is not in the best interest of hunters and hunting to wait for someone else to make the call.    Some simple arithmetic demonstrates the foolishness of opposing required training. Assume that a person starts hunting at 15 and quits at 55. That is 40 years of hunting. Further assume that a basic hunter education course is 12 to 15 hours in length. That is about 18 to 22.5 minutes per year spent in learning basic skills — hardly an undue burden. Even if the course were doubled or refreshers were required every 10 years as originally proposed, that would be at most a half hour per year over the span of a hunter's active hunting years — less than the time it takes to get a haircut! If the time spent fighting this proposal were instead spent in the course, basic certification could have been obtained — certification which is required in every other state and most provinces in Canada.    In summary, the plan called for mandatory hunter training for everyone 30 years old or younger, phase-in of the requirement over a five-year period on a game management unit basis, and a shooting competency test as part of the certification. The plan also outlined a program of advanced courses that would be available to hunters on a voluntary basis. The group made a conscious effort to limit the number of topics and hence time the course required. Their concern was to make a course that addressed real issues facing hunters and hunting and was not a barrier to people wanting to go hunting.    In the spring of 1998 the group presented the division director with their final plan. The plan received unanimous support from the 120-plus volunteer instructors at the meeting. At that time, the director asked for additional volunteers to help develop the standards and curriculum for a new course. As of this writing the curriculum is in rough draft form and is being reviewed by division staff. It will next be sent to steering group members for their review, and should be ready be ready for implementation by the end of March will.   The Board of Game has responded to this proposal by passing regulations calling for mandatory hunter training for those hunters born after January 1, 1984 who wish to hunt in GMU's 7, 14 and 15. This requirement begins January 1, 2000. Proposals before the Board to add GMU's 13 and 20 to the requirement. The plan is on schedule.   In today's world a hunter's behavior is his worst enemy. The continued resistance to some basic level of training only confirms what most nonhunters and many hunters, feel about hunters. This proposal is not the first step down a slippery slope to banning hunting. It is the first step up the ladder of responsibility for having and keeping this privilege.    Top of Document       Youth Shooters are Champions     Kyle Kline (left), Illinois Sub-junior State Sporting Clays Champion, and Casey Willis, Alaska State Class D & Sub-junior Champion. Sporting clays is the fastest growing target sport in the United States. Competitors move from station to station to shoot at a wide variety of targets. Some competitors compare sporting clays to golf with a shotgun. Unlike trap and skeet where each target is reasonably predictable, every station in sporting clays is different, requiring the shooter to develop and use a wide variety of techniques and skills. Clays are thrown from almost every angle and even from towers that are more than 90 feet above the competitors.    The Youth Target Sports Program, first of its kind in the United States, is supported by the local chapters of the Safari Club International, Ruffed Grouse Society, and National Wild Turkey Federation. These conservation organizations conduct fundraising banquets each year and contribute a significant portion of their proceeds to Alaskan conservation and hunting heritage projects.     Casey Willis (14), Rick Stonke (15), and Kyle Kline (14), members of the Hunter Information and Training Program's Youth Target Sports Team, are winners in 1999 sporting clays state championship competition. Casey, a freshman at Service High, is also a member of his high school diving team and a former Junior Olympic gymnastics champion. Casey finished his hunter education course at Goldenview Middle School and began shooting with the Target Sports competitive team in May 1999. Casey, using his well-honed competitive athletic skills to perfect a come-from-behind victory, captured the sub-junior Alaska State sporting clays championship with a two-day score of 105. A Beretta 390 semi-automatic is Casey's choice for competition. Casey's two-day score was also good enough for him to capture the overall Class D championship against many adult competitors. Casey is the son of Gary and Diane Willis of Anchorage.    Rick began shooting with the Target Sports competitive team in June 1998. Rick, who also plays competitive hockey, won the junior state championship on the national-class sporting clays course at Grouse Ridge Shooting Grounds in Wasilla. Using a Beretta Silver Pigeon (12 gauge over/under), Rick took the second-place trophy in the D class competition, only a single target behind team member Casey Willis. Rick is the son of Richard and Kelley Stonke of Anchorage.    If you know of a youngster who has a high interest in learning to shoot safely and would like to be on a team with other young shooters call (907) 267-2241 or (907) 267-2236 in Anchorage for further information. Kyle began shooting competitively in September 1998. A freshman at Service High School and member of the wrestling team, Kyle came to the attention of team coaches at the Great Alaska Sportsman Show when he won the informal “virtual reality” DART® system shooting competition. Kyle, who spent the summer with his dad in Illinois, entered and won the Illinois State subjunior championship using a Beretta 390, semi-automatic 12 gauge. Kyle is the son of Pam Morgan of Anchorage. Other youth competitors who won events during the sporting clays season include Jonathan Hornak and Robert Sipes of Anchorage and C. J. Rue of Fairbanks.     According to coaches and sponsors, the Youth Target Sports Program welcomes new shooters ages 11 to 15. Over 20 shooters participated during the 1998-99 school year. Every young shooter is provided with a safety orientation and hearing and eye protection. Adult coaches are trained and certified in all the shooting disciplines. Youngsters have the opportunity to try their hand at shotgun, .22 rifle, centerfire rifle, and muzzleloaders. Other program activities include instruction and training in survival, wilderness first aid, and land navigation. Program members are also provided the opportunity to participate in conservation activities such as stream cleanups and habitat improvement projects.     In the weekly shotgun league, every participant is placed on a six-person squad that shoots 50 clay targets each week — 25 at trap and 25 on a five-stand sporting clays course. League shooting is held each Tuesday evening at Rabbit Creek Range, which has a new, lighted shotgun shooting range. Individual and team scores are handicapped, making it easy for beginners to compete on an even footing with more experienced shooters. Individual and team awards are presented in May of each year.    Top of Document       Nelchina Caribou Herd News Update    by Bob Tobey, Area Wildlife Biologist in Glennallen     Dramatic changes in the condition of the Nelchina caribou herd may mean ADF&G will have to greatly restrict harvest in the fall 2000 Tier II hunt.    The 1999 calf crop and calf survival to fall were the lowest observed in more than 25 years for the Nelchina herd. The mortality of radio-collared caribou is nearly twice as high as normal. With these changes, the herd has gone from a highly productive one capable of sustaining relatively high human harvest to one of low productivity unable to sustain much human harvest.    To understand what is happening to the Nelchina herd today and in the coming millennium, we need to look at the history of the herd over the past century. From the beginning of the 20th century through the 1940s, the herd was estimated at 15,000. Wolf numbers in Game Management Unit 13 also were low until the 1940s but increased enough that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service instituted a predator control program for the Unit. Between 1948 and 1953, wolf numbers were reduced dramatically, and by 1954 only 12 wolves were believed to remain in GMU 13.    The herd prospered during the 1950s and the early 1960s. Range quality was good and food was abundant. More than 65 percent of GMU 13 had experienced a wildfire in the previous 50 years, mostly caused by humans. The fire helped keep the range productive. The herd peaked in the mid-1960s at about 70,000 caribou.    During the 1950s, human harvests were high and seasons and bag limits liberal. In the late 1960s calf production and survival declined, probably because of food limitations after several years of intense use of the range. After predator control ended, wolves were given complete protection for five years and their numbers rebounded swiftly. By 1965 up to 450 wolves were estimated to be in GMU 13. Caribou survival declined under increased wolf predation. Human harvests also remained high with a reported take of more than 10,000 caribou reported in 1971. In response to the combination of lower productivity, increased wolf mortality and very high human harvest, the herd crashed in just a few years.    By 1972, it was estimated that fewer than 10,000 Nelchina caribou remained. The harvest plummeted to 550 in 1972 and remained below 1,000 for more than a decade. In 1977 the hunt went to drawing permits and in 1990 to Tier II subsistence permits.    The herd began a gradual recovery that eventually peaked at 50,000 in 1995. Lower harvest, improved range conditions and less wolf predation contributed to the recovery. High fur prices during the 1970s and 1980s provided public incentive to trap wolves. Over the past decade, there have been increased restrictions on wolf harvests and a decline in fur prices. As a result, wolf numbers have more than doubled, increasing from about 150 to more than 300 wolves in the annual spring counts. Fall estimates in 1998 and 1999 of over 500 wolves were obtained, compared with estimates ranging from 250 to 350 during the 1980s and early 1990s.    Hunter harvests were limited to 8 to10 percent of the herd annually, and permit numbers were adjusted accordingly. When the herd reached 50,000 in 1995, the range was once again showing signs of significant degradation, so harvest quotas were increased to try to reduce the herd to 35,000 to 40,000 caribou.     A reduction in the herd was achieved and in 1998, the harvest quota went back to a percentage of the annual production to stabilize the herd. But the summer range had again been damaged when the herd hit 50,000. Because less food was available, calf production declined to only 32 calves per 100 cows in 1999, compared to more than than 50 per 100 when the herd was increasing. Four-month-old calves from the Nelchina herd weighed less than calves in other interior herds, another indication of range problems.    Compounding the nutrition problem has been a large jump in the mortality rate of radio-collared cows from less than 10 percent a year from the 1970s until the mid-1990s to 15 to 20 percent as wolf numbers increased. In October and November 1999, wolf predation was so high that, if the rate observed continued, the yearly mortality rate for 1999-2000 on radio-collared animals would exceed percent.    The dilemma facing managers is that with low productivity in the face of high wolf mortality, there is almost no allowable human harvest. The Nelchina herd will decline unless productivity increases or wolf predation decreases. Although caribou numbers are now near the management objective of 35,000, any human harvest will accelerate the decline already occurring.    Under current conditions, the Nelchina herd can support a harvest of 2 to 3 percent, if most of the take is bulls. The federal subsistence hunt in GMU 13 may consume all of the allowable harvest in the year 2000, necessitating sharp reduction in the state Tier II hunt.    If productivity remains low and wolf predation high, harvest rates for the near future will remain around 2 to 3 percent or 500 to 800 animals. If mortality declines to 10 percent (less than half of what it is now), the allowable harvest again will reach the 2,000 to 3,000 figure of recent years.    Top of Document       Field Care of Big Game    Field Care of Big Game , title of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's newest video production, is already a big hit with hunters. Released in August 1999,  Field Care  is a 53-minute, full-color videotape. In  Field Care , an experienced Alaskan game biologist leads a first-time hunter step by step through the process of preparing for a big game hunt and field dressing a moose. One section of the video takes the hunter through a complete list of equipment needed for field dressing. Each piece of equipment is shown and its use in the process of field care clearly explained.     The field dressing sequences in this video were filmed under actual field conditions — there are no simulations. Department producers of  Field Care  researched more than 20 currently available instructional videos about field dressing big game. According to the producers, nearly all of the videos were filmed with 8mm or Hi-8 cameras. As a result the image quality and lighting commonly suffered. Most of the existing videos involved deer or even elk which can be “horsed around” to a better position for field dressing. Some even recommended you hang the animal from a tree limb to remove the internal organs. Without block and tackle you won't go far with a moose, much less up a spindly black spruce!     Field Care  was professionally videotaped by Stuart Aull of Moving Images Productions, using the broadcast quality Beta format. The results are bright, clear pictures of detailed knife work. According to Fish and Game experts, no other field care video on the market demonstrates the technique shown in  Field Care of Big Game . The technique used in this video leads the hunter through each step of skinning a large animal such as a moose or caribou, removing large sections of meat such as shoulders, hams, backstrap, and neck without removing the entrails. The video also illustrates how to leave lawful evidence of sex attached to the hindquarter and the final step of opening the body cavity to reach and remove the highly desirable tenderloins.     Basics of field care, keeping the meat cool, clean, and dry are emphasized in the video. In the video, experts explain how meat can quickly spoil unless it is removed from the carcass and allowed to quickly cool. Cooling the meat retards spoilage and results in great table fare. Meat care experts also caution hunters that the meat must be kept clean. Leaves, grass, soil, and hair as well as bodily fluids, must be removed from the meat. This means taking your time during the field dressing process to pick off foreign matter. Heavy-duty game bags that protect the meat are essential to the field dressing process. Once the meat is cool and clean, it must also be kept dry. Keeping meat dry on a float trip requires keeping the meat lightly covered in the raft and then hung each night so that it can remain dry. When hunting from a base camp, erect a tarp over the meat bags to protect it from rain or snow.     Insects are often a problem, particularly in the early caribou and moose seasons. According to the experts in  Field Care , the best way to deal with pesky flies is to spray the meat with a citric acid solution. Food grade citric acid is readily available at pharmacies and feed stores. A protective film is formed on the meat when citric acid is mixed with water and sprayed on the meat. Apparently flies don't like to lay their eggs on the sharply acidic surface. Another excellent tip is to soak the meat bags in the citric acid solution and let them dry before the hunting trip. Even though the solution has dried it remains effective.   See  ADF&G Videos  for information on availability or purchase of this video.    Top of Document       Rabbit Creek Range Improvements    View of new enclosed rifle shooting range under construction. Project headed by Kirk Lingofelt and Lee Rogers. The  Hunter Information and Training Program  announces a series of range improvement projects at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Rabbit Creek Range in south Anchorage. Each year the Rabbit Creek Range provides more than 15,000 Alaskan hunters with a safe place to sight in and practice with their firearms. Rabbit Creek is a comprehensive shooting facility that provides a 100-yard range for handgun, a 100-yard range for centerfire rifle, a 100-yard .22 range, a 50-yard instructional range, shotgun, and archery ranges. At the present time the handgun and centerfire ranges have covered shooting points to protect shooters from rain and snow. Rabbit Creek also has a range house that provides shooters with target frames, target bases, sandbags, and paper targets. Spotting scopes and chronographs are available for a nominal rental fee.    According to Lee Rogers, rangemaster, the range improvement program is the result of a capital improvement project (CIP) funded by the state legislature during the 1999 session. The CIP, Rogers says, is being used to enclose and provide radiant heaters for the shooting points on the centerfire rifle range. These modifications, along with the installation of lighting, will provide shooters with a comfortable place to test reloads or practice during the long Alaska winter.   Range use fees at Rabbit Creek are $5 per day, $30 for a 7-day pass, or $40 for an annual pass. Rabbit Creek Range is open Friday through Tuesday each week. Winter hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Summer hours run June 15 through September 15. Summer hours are 11a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. On Saturday and Sunday, summer hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For additional information on Rabbit Creek Range call 345-7831. The instructional range, used by Hunter Information and Training Program hunter education classes and hunter clinics will also receive new covered shooting points, allowing use in our sometimes “misty” weather. Improvements will also be made to the archery range. The Archery Manufacturers Organization and Alaska Bowhunters Association provided the Hunter Information and Training Program grants to install lighting and make other improvements to the existing archery range. The upgrades will allow year-around use of the archery range and also support the Hunter Information and Training Program's Youth Target Sports Development Program.    John Matthews, program coordinator, tells the  Hunting Bulletin  that a new trap machine and lighting has been installed on the shotgun range. These developments will provide shotgun shooters with an opportunity to practice their skills with the nontoxic shot required for waterfowl hunting. The new lighting system will allow use of the range during the winter months until the 6 p.m. closing time, well after normal darkness. Matthews says that steel shot and clay targets will soon be available for sale at the range house for the convenience of shooters.    For the comfort of shooters and family members accompanying them, the present range house will be remodeled. A lounge area will be constructed with comfortable seating, a TV, video library, ballistics computer, microwave oven, vending machines, and an “endless” coffeepot to warm everyone.    Top of Document       Have Gun – Will Travel     Alaska Department of Fish & Game's Mobile Target Sports System appeared at the State Fair in Palmer. The Mobile System is scheduled to make several appearances in SE Alaska this spring. The  Hunter Information and Training Program  recently unveiled its new and innovative Mobile Target Sports Program for Alaskan hunters and recreational shooters. The state legislature provided the funds to purchase and operate the mobile system through a capital improvement project. The heart of the program is a 36-foot 5th-wheel trailer. Two qualified Fish and Game instructor-technicians will travel with the mobile system. When conducting clinics around the state the technicians will be supported by regional fish and game personnel and volunteer hunter education instructors.    The bread and butter of the mobile system is a DART® laser interactive shooting system designed for use with both bows and firearms. The DART® system allows the mobile shooting sports training system to be used at locations where live fire would not be practical. For example, the mobile system will use the DART® training format at the Anchorage and Fairbanks outdoor sports shows, various fairs, and at schools. The Texas Parks and Wildlife department used such a system to introduce more than 100,000 junior-high-age students to the safe and proper use of firearms during the 1997-98 school year.    The DART® is the premier laser-activated, interactive firearms and archery training system in the United States. The DART® system consists of a laser disc player and projector, a computer operating system, and a sensitized screen which reflects the laser beam into a special camera attached to the projector. While technically complicated, the system is easy to use. More than 20 special training laser discs are provided with the system. Some of the video laser discs are made from videos of entirely Alaska big game animals. Other discs allow one to “hunt” Lower 48 game such as whitetail deer, mule deer, antelope, and turkey. Some discs are primarily for entertainment, the targets consisting of inanimate objects like the old shooting gallery games for rifle shooters or clay targets for shotgun shooters.    According to state Hunter Information and Training coordinators, one of the best uses of the DART® system is to help hunters practice precise shot placement and knowledge of big game anatomy without the noise, expense, or recoil of firing actual big-bore rifles, handguns, or arrows. After the “hunter” takes a shot at a video animal the action freezes and a red or blue vital target area is illuminated. The hunter can tell immediately if the practice shot would have quickly taken the animal. In some accessible and heavily hunted areas, the combination of animals dying from wounding loss and poaching exceeds the legal take. It is imperative that Alaskan hunters minimize wounding loss of big game. Fewer animals lost to wounding could mean an increase in hunting opportunity or larger bag limits.    The trailer will also be fully equipped with clay target machines, shotguns, rifles, muzzleloaders, bows, and the support equipment necessary to conduct clinics in shotgun skills, waterfowl hunting, steel-shot education, muzzleloading, rifle marksmanship, archery and other advanced hunting skills clinics. Present plans call for the mobile system to be available for use by March, 1999 and on the road beginning in May. The first summer tour of the mobile system will be to Southeast Alaska. Traveling between communities by the state marine highway system the mobile unit is tentatively scheduled to visit the Southeast communities of Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, Sitka, and Haines as well as Tok, Valdez, and Glenallen. Clinic topics in each area will be determined by the interests expressed by local hunters and recreational shooters.     According to program coordinator John Matthews, the summer season will culminate with an appearance of the mobile system at the Palmer State Fair. If pilot program results from the Great Alaska Sports Show in Anchorage and the Fairbanks Outdoor Show are any indication, the system will be used by thousands of Alaskans, shooters and not-yet-shooters alike.    In subsequent years the mobile system will be scheduled to tour the remainder of the state road system including the Kenai Peninsula, Southcentral and interior areas of Alaska.

Top of Document       Alaska's Bigfoot: Creature of Lore or Reality?    by Steven C. Levi    Let's face it, there is only one person with a lower credibility than an Outsider with a bear story, and that's an Alaskan with a Bigfoot story. Bigfoot, of course, is the legendary humanoid that haunts the wilds of North America. So elusive that few scientists believe it exists at all. The evidence is, at best, scanty, contradictory, and largely apocryphal. When it comes to Alaska, legend and lore have become even more convoluted.   While the Pacific Northwest may have Bigfoot — often called Sasquatch — Alaska has a veritable smorgasbord of humanoids. Unlike the “Lower 48,” there is a substantial history of sightings of these creatures, mostly by Natives. These sightings were not in some by-gone era but recent and consistent enough to be investigated — if mainstream science wants to take a serious look at the phenomenon.   In many parts of Alaska there are humanoids that Natives firmly believe exist. In addition to the “Hairy Man” of Kokhanok and the “Little People” of Noorvik, there is also “Caribou Man,” called the  Tutu  by the Innupiat. In the forests of the Interior there is the  Nakhani , and in Kotzebue Sound there is the  Nuyaqpalik  or “long hair.” A mermaid of sorts, she has extremely long hair and drags solitary fishermen out of their boats to a watery grave.    The Alaskan humanoid perhaps best know by non-Natives is the  Kushtacah  or “water devil” of Southeast Alaska. The  Kushtacah  leapt from lore to literature during the Alaska Gold Rush when encounters between man and beast began to be recorded. This, however, is not a passive, shy beast but one of violence. Perhaps the most graphic description of  Kushtacah  and its alleged violence was included in the 1953 self-published Alaskan classic, THE STRANGEST STORY EVER TOLD, by Harry D. Colp. Historians, it should be added, have had trouble verifying Colp's claims.    On the other hand, W. R. Abercrombie, a reputable historical source, added a new twist to the story of the  Kushtacah . That was in 1898 as the disastrous Valdez Stampede was drawing to a close. Several thousand miners had stampeded across the treacherous Valdez Glacier hoping to find gold nuggets the “size of goose eggs” in the Copper River watershed. They were to be worse than disappointed. Hundreds never made it over the glacier and as many as a thousand were starving to death along the Copper River. The few who were lucky enough to make it back to Valdez were living in decrepit mining shelters “packed like sardines in a box.” Abercrombie wrote that he believed that “70 percent [of the derelict miners] were mentally deranged.” But he did record one conversation of interest. One Swede had talked about a “glacial demon” which had attacked him and his son twice. During the second attack, the boy had been strangled to death. “When I heard this story there were some ten or twelve other than me in the cabin,” Abercrombie recalled, “and at that time, it would not have been safe to dispute the theory of the existence of this demon on the Valdez Glacier, as every man in there firmly believed it to be a reality.”   Although the white man has always had trouble linking the Bigfoot to reality, Natives have had no such difficulty. Sometimes the disparity of opinion led to comical results. In the early 1900s, a ship went down outside Katalla. Because the water was only 15 feet deep and the ship submerged close to shore, the insurance company decided to salvage the wreck and sent a deep-sea diver north to inspect the wreck. Soon after he had submerged for the first time a group of Natives paddled alongside the scow handling the air hoses and asked what the whites were doing. As a joke, the whites said that a  Kushtacah  had capsized a boat and they were fishing for the water devil. If they caught him, they would kill him.    The Natives hovered around the scow so the whites decided to pull a practical joke. As soon as the diver indicated he was coming up, the whites went into a frenzy explaining to the Natives that they had caught the  Kushtacah . As soon as the diver's hardhat broke the surface of the water, the Natives “all jumped overboard and swam to shore.”   Back in the present, an unscientific survey of hunters showed them to be as divided as the scientific community. Although no hunter surveyed admitted to ever having seen a Bigfoot, many of them did report seeing other aspects of nature equally perplexing, including a cheechako trying to catch ducks with a king salmon net, a mid-air collision involving a plane and a fish, UFOs, and very close encounters of the large, hairy, hungry, brown kind. Those who did not believe in Bigfoot stated that with so many hunters in so many parts of Alaska, it was hard to believe that hide nor hair of the beast has been found. Not to be outdone, true believers pointed out that it was rare for a hunter to find the remains of bear in the wild. Considering that the Bigfoot population was substantially smaller than that of the bear, it was thus not reasonable to expect that hide, hair, bones, or teeth of the elusive beast would be found even with all of the hunters all over Alaska. Native sightings were discounted by some hunters as “unreliable” although true believers state that it is reasonable for Natives to see the humanoid because, after all, the Natives have been living in the Alaskan bush a lot longer than any professional hunter. Thus the debate rages.    Is there a Bigfoot in Alaska? According to the lore of the region, absolutely. With regard to established scientific standards of proof, no. But then again, as Alaskan humorist Warren Sitka notes lyrically,    Myth and legend often find  Truth and fiction intertwined  And oft the truth is stranger still  Than fantasy with all its frills    Top of Document       AMO Grant to Hunter Heritage Foundation Boosts Program    Seeking to preserve the sport of bowhunting and to promote the sport of archery, manufacturers of bowhunting and target archery equipment banded together to form the Archery Manufacturers Organization or AMO. In turn the AMO created the “Save our Heritage Fund.” The fund provides grants to organizations and agencies for the express purpose of promoting the growth and acceptance of bowhunting and archery. Save our Heritage grants are awarded each year by the AMO board of directors to applicants whose competitive proposals contain detailed plans, which meet AMO goals of preserving bowhunting and promoting archery.    In April 1999 the Hunter Heritage Foundation, a cooperative nonprofit foundation formed by the Alaska Fish and Wildlife Conservation Fund and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, applied for a Save our Heritage grant. The Hunter Heritage Foundation provides financial support to many Department projects. During 1999 the Foundation has supported the  Becoming an Outdoor Woman  program and the Youth Target Sports programs conducted by the  Hunter Information and Training Program . Now the Hunter Heritage Foundation has partnered with Fish and Game's Hunter Information and Training Program to increase the number of Alaskans, and particularly youth, actively participating in recreational archery and bowhunting. In June 1999 the AMO awarded the Hunter Heritage Foundation a Save our Heritage grant in the amount of $22,385.    Some of the grant funds are being used to produce a public information television ad promoting archery as a recreational and competitive sport for participants of all ages. The new televised ad shows individuals and groups from six to 60 actively learning, participating in, and enjoying archery activities. According to Hunter Information and Training Program coordinators, the TV ad is now in post-production and should be seen on statewide television beginning in January 2000.   In addition to promoting the sport of archery through broadcast media, grant funds are being used to purchase archery equipment for the Hunter Information and Training Program's Mobile Target Sports Program trailer. Kirk Lingofelt, coordinator of the Mobile Program, says that the new archery equipment will allow his crew to outfit participants with the appropriate bows for use with the interactive DART® videodisc interactive shooting program, regardless of age or strength. According to Kirk, the new equipment and the DART® system will make an appearance at the Alaska Bowhunters Association banquet that will be held in Anchorage January 29, 2000. The Mobile System will also be a centerpiece attraction at the Alaska Chapter of the Safari Club International's hunter symposium to be held at the Egan Center in Anchorage on 25 and 26 of February 2000.    Save our Heritage grant funds are also being used to equip and train young archers and bowhunters ages 9 through 15. Equipment provided by the grant allows certified instructors to provide every youngster with an appropriate weight-of-pull and length bow. Instructors say that having equipment that is designed for all ages and sizes insures that new shooters have a successful first experience with bows and encourages them to become active participants in archery and bowhunting.     Bowhunters are the fastest-growing segment of the hunter population in Alaska. Since the lethal range of a bow is often measured in feet, the bowhunter must have razor-sharp hunting skills. National surveys of hunters show that as they gain experience they increasingly feel it is not necessary to kill an animal to have a great hunt. Other qualities of the hunt become more important, including honing skills such as animal sign identification and stalking. Hunters seeking to increase the challenge of hunting and tilt the odds more in favor of the game animal, often take up the bow. Because bows can be more safely used near population centers, the Alaska Board of Game has instituted a number of archery-only hunts. Hunters interested in the  archery-only hunts  should consult the current hunting regulations.     Bowhunters who wish to hunt in the archery-only hunts must complete an approved  bowhunter education  course. This course focuses on safety, knowledge of game anatomy, and proficiency with the bow. The Hunter Information and Training Program offers the classroom portion of the bowhunter education courses during the winter months. As spring arrives, aspiring bowhunters return to take a field-shooting test to complete their certification. If you are interested in registering for an upcoming  bowhunter education course  call your local Fish and Game office for times and dates.    Top of Document       Cartridges of Alaska's Hunters – Too Much Gun?    Southcentral Alaska's five most popular rifle cartridges for big game: 7mm Rem. Mag., .30-06, .300 Win. Mag., .338 Win. Mag., .375 H&H Mag.   As Southcentral hunters prepared for the 1999 hunting season Lee Rogers, rangemaster at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Rabbit Creek Range in Anchorage, conducted a survey of 1,848 Alaskan hunters. Rogers surveyed hunters to find out what cartridges Alaskan hunters are choosing for their big game hunting. According to Lee, hunters sighted in rifles using 70 different cartridges during the July to September survey.     The most popular cartridge with Southcentral hunters is the tried and true .30-06, used by 387 or 21 percent of hunters. The .30-06 was closely followed by the .300 Winchester Magnum with 342, and the .338 Winchester Magnum with 339. Lee says these three cartridges combined are used by almost six out of ten Southcentral hunters. There was a huge drop from the .338 Winchester to the next most popular cartridge, the 7mm Remington Magnum with 157 users.    Lee also looked at cartridges by caliber. The 30 caliber, for almost 60 years the choice of the U.S. military, boasted 912 users or almost exactly one-half of all hunters surveyed. The highly popular .30-06 and .300 Winchester Magnum are joined in this group by the .308 Winchester, .30-30, .307 Winchester, .300 Savage, .300 Weatherby Magnum, and the new .300 Remington Ultra Magnum.        ALASKA TOP TEN CARTRIDGES   Cartridge # of Hunters %   .30-06 387 20.9   .300 Win. Mag. 342 18.5   .338 Win. Mag. 339 18.4   7mm Rem. Mag. 157 8.5   .375 H&H Mag. 116 6.3   .270 Win.   108 5.8   .308 Win.   65 3.5   .300 Weath. Mag. 64 3.5   45-70 Gov. 25 1.4   .280 Rem. 20 1.1     Taking a distant second place were the cartridges using .338 diameter bullets. The increasingly popular .338 Winchester was joined in this group by the wildcat .338-06 and the .340 Weatherby Magnum. Almost one out of five hunters are using these medium-bore rifles for their big game hunting.    The third most popular caliber proved to be the 7mm. Led by the 7mm Remington Magnum, the 7mm clan had 202 users or about 1 of 10 Southcentral hunters. The 280 Remington, 7X57 Mauser, 7mm-08, and 7mm Shooting Times Westerner were used by a total of 42 hunters.    The classic Alaskan brown bear cartridge, the .375 H&H showed well, being used by 116 or 6.3 percent of all the hunters surveyed. Cartridges with the word “Magnum” in their name accounted for 1086 or 58.7 percent of all cartridges used.    This last statistic is the most interesting, according to Lee Rogers, who talks with and watches over 15,000 shooters each year. Many hunters, says Rogers, are uncomfortable with their loud, hard-recoiling magnums. Lee says that when a hunter is shooting a hard-kicking slobber-knocker"" magnum, he or she often sights-in the rifle from a bench rest as quickly as possible and then packs up and leaves the range. Sometimes the hunter may even have to quit before the rifle is fully ready for the hunting fields.     To confirm his theory that too much gun frequently results in too little practice, Rogers conducted a short study on hunters' ability to shoot their rifles from hunting positions at game-sized targets. During the summer of 1999, Lee asked more than 80 hunters to chronograph their hunting loads to determine the actual velocity. Hunters sighted in their rifles under Lee's expert supervision on a secure, stable bench rest. After sighting in, hunters were asked to shoot three shots at the vital, heart-lung zone of a full-sized moose silhouette, standing broadside at a distance of 100 yards. The individuals in the study averaged 19 years of hunting experience.     Rogers says that less than one-half (46 percent) of hunters placed all three shots in the 16-inch by 24-inch vital zone. Twenty-eight percent of all shots taken would have wounded rather than immediately killed the moose. Most of the wounding shots are, in the opinion of Rogers, the result of too much gun and too little practice from the basic hunting positions of sitting, kneeling, and off-hand. Only about one out of ten hunters practices shooting from these hunting positions after sighting in their rifle, states rangemaster Rogers.    This lack of practical practice, compounded by the use of a gun that is simply unpleasant to shoot, is likely to result in wounding and crippling animals. In a Department of Fish and Game telephone survey of Alaskan hunters, 38 percent said they had killed a big game animal that had been previously wounded by another hunter. According to Rogers, the results of this survey seem to confirm what he sees daily.    Do Alaskan hunters need these big-kicking magnums for big game? Not really, say most biologists, hunter educators, and experienced big game hunters. Big game animals are not killed by foot-pounds of kinetic energy or some mystical “knock-down” power. Big game is consistently, quickly, and humanely killed by accurate, precise placement of a well-constructed bullet in the vital heart-lung area. A cartridge loaded with a 180 grain Nosler (partition bullet) fired from the 94-year-old .30-06 will almost always pass completely through a moose or caribou, taking out both lungs. Rogers says that hunters should find a cartridge and gun they can shoot comfortably enough to fire 30 to 40 rounds during a practice session. After sighting in, all the hunter's practice should be from hunting positions likely to be used in the field.    Furthermore, when hunters chronograph their magnum factory loads they are often surprised they are getting so much buck and bang and so little gain. For example, during Roger's survey 15 hunters using .300 Winchester Magnum factory ammunition loaded with 180 grain bullets averaged 2,919 feet per second for 45 shots. Twelve different .30-06 rifles using factory ammunition loaded with 180-grain bullets chronographed 2,644 feet per second. See, some say, you get 275 feet per second difference! In the real world of hunting that works out to a gain of about 25 yards in range in exchange for easily one-third more recoil and a hefty increase in muzzle blast!     What about bears, hunters ask? Shouldn't Alaskan hunters have a magnum in case I have a run-in with 'ol fuzzy? Bear experts say that alertness in the field and keen observation skills are better protection than a magnum rifle. Analysis of bear encounters reveals the fact that most surprise encounters with a bear are just that, a surprise. Fortunately for bear and man, the bear usually swaps ends and runs away. In the rare event of a genuine charge the distance is typically measured in feet, and the hunter most likely carrying his rifle slung over the shoulder or in one hand. Under these circumstances he has no real chance to gather himself, ram a cartridge in the chamber and make an accurate, aimed shot at any vital area. In the even more unlikely event that the hunter is carrying his rifle “at-the-ready” and is able to take an aimed shot, a well-placed .30-06 will do more good than a poorly placed .300 or even .375 magnum. Most of us are simply better off hunting with a partner, remaining alert to bear sign, avoiding dense thickets where visibility is virtually zip, and quickly moving game meat away from the gut pile.     Hunters are responsible for wise use of our wildlife resource and using too much gun that results in wounded and crippled animals is not what we should aim for when we hunt.     Top of Document       What Do Boars and Billies Have in Common?    by Ace Sommerfeld    Plenty. In fact, boars and billies share traits a goat hunter can put to good use. Thinking like a bear hunter on your next goat hunt can swing the odds of collecting a top-notch trophy in your favor.    Unfortunately, “next” for most goat hunters means first and last. The matter of doing it right the first time carries the same importance as being physically and mentally prepared for the challenge of successful goat hunting. Stacking all the odds in your favor is still not enough at times.    A true mountain goat trophy should fit three basic criteria: a mature billy, fresh winter hair, no damage to horns or cape.    Hunting carries no guarantees in hunting bears or goats that you'll harvest a mature male, but more than 20 years of goat hunting have taught me to watch for a few important points. Getting in shape and having good gear don't mean much if you don't know what animal on the mountain to pursue.    Perhaps the most common mistake inexperienced mountain goat hunters make is not doing enough glassing before heading up the mountain. My 1999 hunt was typical. I chose not to hunt, but got a call from a friend's co-worker who drew, and asked if I'd tag along — “for the fun of it,” I recall him saying. I wasn't sure about the fun part, but I learn something new on every hunt. Besides, the permit was in an area new to me so away we went.    Goats showed up before the binoculars were put to use. Two herds occupied opposite ends of a long mountain. My partner was ready to make a beeline for the nearest bunch.    “With 13 animals in a herd, I can tell they are nannies and kids,” I said. “There's seven in the other, I'll bet they're nannies too.”    Many goat hunters fail to realize old billies, like mature boars, require solitude and lots of space. I remember a hunt out of Homer a few years ago in which I counted eight billies, each with its own mountain. We worked a different mountain every day, and three hunters took three nice billies.    The long-term assurance of old boars existing as long as sows are roaming around is a law restricting the harvest of sows and their cubs. A limited attempt at the concept is made for goats in some areas, but it could be expanded. Studies indicate kids average the shortest distance between themselves and their nanny, compared to other North American game species, making them easy to pair up even in a crowd.    The biggest advantage of restricting nannies and kids is the tendency of hunters to ignore herds and concentrate on loners. You'll get a better trophy, and a nanny that would've left the mountain in a sack has another chance to perpetuate her kind. My field notes indicate there is an 85 percent chance that a single animal is a billy. I will stalk an unidentified loner as if I know it's a big billy until I can judge its size and gender.    I made the typical mistakes of an inexperienced goat hunter the first few years of my career. Most of the billies we harvested were the 3- to 5-year-old variety. Gary McCarthy took an impressive 6-year-old once, but in the end, I realized I was hunting in areas accessible to every hunter. If you can't hunt permit only areas or get away from other hunters, the challenge of harvesting an old billy is taken to another level. Hunter-wise billies often find an impossible slope and hole-up until the commotion below dies down.    Getting away from walk-in hunts on the Kenai Peninsula was a giant step for consistently harvesting old billies, but it wasn't enough. I'd find three or four young billies together and harvest the largest one. When the smoke cleared I'd catch a lone animal sneaking out the back door from some secretive section of the mountain. These were the billies I should've been concentrating on. As time passed their habits began to make sense, and locating them became easier. It generally just requires more patience in glassing. A once-over with a rifle scope works for nannies, but not for old billies.    The rugged terrain that billies choose to reside in can be used against them and may play a major role in keeping the cape in prime shape. After a billy has been spotted, it is often possible to stalk into very close range. An archer told me goats are the easiest animals in Alaska to harvest with a bow. Many of my stalks have ended inside 40 yards, so I understand his point.    Getting close to a big billy has several advantages. Your naked eye will tell you in a flash if you have a mature billy in front of you. Exact bullet placement is more likely at 30 yards than at 300. Determining if a billy will drop in a safe and accessible spot is easier at close range. Proper stalking is an element of goat hunting you learn with experience and often separates a good hunt from a bad one.    Horns alone are not the full measure of a mountain goat trophy. It takes a large head and fresh winter hair to complete the package. Horn size has little to do with the age of a billy. Ted Spraker, a mountain goat biologist with Alaska's Department of Fish and Game says, “A 3-year old billy from a healthy nanny that experiences mild winters can obtain 10-inch horns.” On the other hand, I have harvested 8-year old billies with eight-inch horns. The advantage older horns have over younger horns is character. Age rings and battle scars chronicle the life and times of a tough hombre.     Hair condition on billies is just as important as on bears, so timing your hunt is crucial for trophy quality. “The hair on old billies begins to mat up almost immediately,” says Joe Romero, a taxidermist who has worked with many goats. “Late October to late November is the best time to harvest a billy.”   “Late October in most goat country means dealing with snow, but it won't keep you from locating animals. It requires more glassing (there's that word again), but a goat's cream-colored coat stands out against a snowy backdrop. Mountain winds whip a ridge top clear of snow in a couple of days after a storm, and goats quickly settle on the clear spots. Fresh winter hair on a brown hillside is a dead giveaway.”   “Throughout goat season, time on a mountain is a serious concern. In late October, days are short and nights are endless. Getting off the mountain before dark can be the difference between life and death. Many times the snowline has coaxed billies below it, giving us the pleasure of a quick day on the mountain.”    Knowing when to say when in late season is also important. If you spot a billy late in the day, don't worry about putting the stalk off until first light. In 1989, I drew a Kenai permit and kept tabs on a billy for the entire month of September. It remained in the same basin, and I harvested it on the final day of the season. The basin overlooked the Seward Highway, and any permit holder could've looked up there and spotted it. Don't neglect the obvious places in your permit area. Limited permits allow billies to grow old, and they show up anywhere.    Every time I hunt the coast I am impressed with how much better the weather is compared to that in the mountains a few miles inland. Mountains hugging the ocean stay free of snow for most of the goat hunting season. Goats know it and are not shy about living above a pounding surf. The hair will be as long as on inland goats, and I have carried out stalks in less than two hours from the beach.     Transportation to remote goat country was always a problem until I started hiring off-season fishermen to get me there. A few flight services are still willing to work that time of year, but don't have the carrying capacity to accommodate a comfortable coastal hunt, which should include a raft and outboard.    If dollars get in the way of hiring a boat or time is insufficient, perhaps you should postpone the hunt. This should be the most important hunt of the year. Set aside at least a week. Most of my hunts are over in a few days, but weird things happen along the coast. Bad weather, rugged terrain, or billies holed up in spots where damage to the cape is likely, can slow things down.    The third element of a top-notch billy, keeping the horns and hair in good shape, has several parallels to a bear hunt. Everyone knows the worst situation a bear hunter faces is not putting a big boar down for keeps immediately.    Stopping a billy in its tracks is equally important. It's hard to imagine the thoughts flowing through your mind as a billy does a nose dive onto rock far below. What should've been a happy ending to a challenging endeavor could easily go south because you picked the wrong caliber.    Knowing when not to shoot and using the right weapon are the two most important considerations for getting the cape and horns to the taxidermist in good shape. A good round for bears will also work well for billies. The object is to stop the billy from going anywhere after being hit. Even on gentle terrain, cliffs are never far away and attract wounded goats like magnets.    Stopping power is more important than flat trajectory. My .300 Magnum loaded with .220 grain slugs does well but gets outperformed by slightly larger calibers such as the .338 Magnum. Rounds to stay from are the barrel-burning screamers that work on antelope.    My long-time hunting partner, Thor Prestegaard, has spent equal time hunting boars and billies. He cautions hunters not to take a big billy lightly. He uses the same heavy caliber rifle for brown bears and billy goats.    Waiting for a billy to get into a spot where falling is unlikely could take a minute or a week. It starts with the general area you picked to hunt. A mature billy in lightly hunted country has as much confidence as a boar and will venture from cliffs to enjoy a meal. That's when you should be in position to shoot.    From keeping goat numbers healthy to adding a true goat trophy to your collection, harvesting an old billy makes sense. Mr. Spraker says, “If fewer nannies were harvested, more goats would be roaming around, and permits would increase.”    Putting a big billy with long hair and roughed up horns in your trophy room could be the most challenging and rewarding hunt you'll ever make.    Top of Document       Fly-out Hunting From the Air Taxi's View    By Don Bowers    Thousands of hunters take advantage of unguided fly-in hunts every year. Hiring an air taxi to fly out and drop you off can be the experience of a lifetime, or it can be a nightmare. The more you know, the better your hunt will be.    This article is intended to give you a better idea of what to expect when you call an air taxi operator for a drop-off unguided hunt. In some cases we can do more than you think. In other areas we're only human, and in any case we still have to obey the laws of physics and the Federal Aviation Administration.    Your first call to us [Don is chief pilot for Hudson Air Service in Talkeetna] is usually, “Where can I go to get a moose (or sheep or caribou or bear or whatever)?” Our answer will always be, “It depends.” Yes, we do try to keep an eye on likely areas where we can put our customers, but in many cases we can't fine-tune things until just before the season. Some places are generally good every year, but others can vary widely. In any case, please don't ask us to get specific and give up our trade secrets.    We will do our best to drop you where you'll have a good chance to get what you're after. We won't put you on top of any of our other clients hunting for the same species. Of course, we can't guarantee there won't be other hunters there, but there won't be anybody there who flew in with us. And if we know a location is going to be crowded with other hunters, we'll try to avoid it because it wouldn't be a good hunt for you.    Likewise, we won't even begin to guarantee a trophy hunt, and any air taxi operator who does should be taken with a large grain of salt. The areas we have access to can usually be accessed by anyone else with a plane (and undoubtedly have been for years), and trophies are few and far between even though the overall hunting may be good. In any case, don't expect us to try to stick a Cessna 185 into a 400-foot Super Cub strip on the side of a mountain, even if there's a 70-inch bull munching shrubs at the end of the runway. If you want a trophy, go with a licensed guide, and be prepared to pay handsomely for the privilege.    This leads to the next question, price. Our hunting rates may be somewhat different from our normal charter rates simply because hunters often involve more work and more risk than other customers. When we agree to fly you out and bring you back, we become responsible for you, and that can translate directly into extra cost on our part with additional trips and more wear and tear on the airplane.    That said, most air taxis offer the whole airplane (in our case, usually a Cessna 185 on floats or wheels) for a fixed hourly rate. This includes the entire flying time for the pilot  and airplane, even when you're not on it, multiplied by as many trips as are necessary to get everything safely out and back. As with most prices, it may be open to some negotiation, but don't expect anybody to give away the farm. For many locations we have a price already listed to save time when you call, but it's still based on flying time. Some operators may offer flat rates or per-person rates. Check these out carefully — you may be going with someone else and you may end up someplace you're not thrilled about with a couple of dozen of your closest friends.    As a rule, we figure a Cessna 185 can safely take about 700 pounds of passengers and their gear into a typical remote lake or bush strip, sometimes more, sometimes less. A 206 may haul a hundred pounds more, a Beaver several hundred more. Our limitation is usually bulk — a Cessna 185 or even a 206 will normally fill up before it gets too heavy. (Beavers are better on the bulk end of things.)    When you plan your departure date, try to allow leeway for weather. Alaska is notorious for foul weather during hunting season, and almost no air taxi aircraft are certified for instrument capability. Besides, the drop-off location probably doesn't even have so much as a windsock for an instrument approach anyway. The bottom line is that safe pilots won't push it. Usually a three-day window, or an alternate date several days later, will do nicely.    Establishing the pick-up is critical. We will do our best to be where you say you will be, when you say you will be there. Don't worry if we're not there exactly on time. We may be delayed by weather or other factors beyond our control, but we guarantee we'll be trying to get there. In the worst case, remember that any reputable air taxi will make sure someone else knows you're there. And of course you will have notified someone to check with us if you're not back on time.     In some cases we may be early. Sometimes we can fly by and check on you while you're in the field. The universal signal for an early pickup is to spread a tarp out in a prominent place. We can also be early if we know the weather is going to get really bad and there's a risk you'd be in the field too long. Late in the season, we will also want to get you out before the first big snowfall.    It's nice if you have some way to communicate with us from the field, but it's not required. We sometimes have no way of knowing what the weather is like at your camp, and any information will help us. We can also let you know if we're having problems. Cell phones work in many areas, and the new satellite phones are usually effective. You can rent satellite phones at a reasonable rate. An aircraft radio is sometimes useful for short-range work, and a simple handheld CB can be a lifesaver (our planes all have CBs installed).    What should you take in with you? We see a staggering range of loads going out to the field. Some people take everything, while others take so little we worry they'll have enough. The rule of thumb is to pack as lightly as you possibly can, especially if you're going to have to pack it someplace after you get off the plane. On the other hand, remember that the weather during hunting season can get abominable very quickly and can stay that way for days. Don't leave yourself short.    There are some things you should NOT plan on taking. It is absolutely against the law to carry bulk propane bottles with passengers. The only acceptable propane is in the small disposable cylinders. (Note: On a float plane, small bulk propane bottles MAY be carried externally or in the floats.) You can take quite a bit of gasoline or Coleman fuel inside the cabin, though — up to 20 gallons per load.    Under NO circumstances can you carry any kind of incapacitating agent inside the airplane — pepper spray, bear spray, mace, tear gas, or whatever. It doesn't matter if it's hermetically sealed in a fireproof safe — it can't go in the cabin. However, these MAY be carried externally, even on wheel planes, by taping the canisters to the strut or gear leg.    Naturally, your guns must be unloaded to go in the plane. The ammunition must be separate from the gun (i.e., not in the case). Don't plan to wear your pistol in the plane, loaded or not. If nothing else, it gets in the way of the seat belts. You can fly your guns in hard cases if you want, but it's a lot of extra weight and bulk. Soft cases generally do fine and are a lot less trouble. Any air taxi will be glad to hold your hard cases until you get back.    Big bulky items are a headache. Large coolers are bad — please don't show up with 150-quart monsters. Small coolers are better if you need them. In general, anything big and bulky that won't stuff or fold is going to be a problem. Long things — say, longer than 6 or 7 feet — can also be awkward. Space is at a premium and small items or things we can massage to fit odd spaces are always better, and you'll get more loads for your money. If you have to take something outsize, please talk it over with us before you surprise us on the ramp.     We expect you to get all your permits and licenses and tags and harvest tickets. Most air taxis don't sell these items. We usually take you at your word when you say you're legal to go to a specific game management unit. Some of our locations may require permits from Native corporations or other landholders. If we think one of these areas may be good for you, we'll let you know well ahead of time what you need, and you can decide if it's what you want.    When it's time to come home, remember that the load capability coming out may not be as heavy as that going in — sometimes much less. When possible, we try to limit the outbound load to whatever we can get out of the remote location in one load, unless you agree that two or more return loads will be needed. If you get a moose, you can definitely count on paying for an extra load, but we can often fit in a sheep or caribou (or even a couple) without an extra flight. Regardless, PLEASE trust your pilot's judgment when he says enough is enough. Two trips is a lot better than a trip to the hospital via a medevac helicopter.    Please remember that most pilots are hunters, too. We have a pretty good idea how much meat should be coming out from a moose or caribou (boned or otherwise), or if something isn't quite kosher. If we do find out you're not playing by the rules, we will notify Fish and Wildlife Protection. When we bring out your animal, we will check for tags and tickets and, if necessary, a transfer of possession form. And please don't forget that the rack can't come out until the meat is moved.    A note on racks: With a Cessna or a Beaver on wheels, ALL racks must go inside the airplane. Big caribou racks are notoriously difficult to fit inside Cessna cabins and may require an extra flight just because of the space they take. Super Cubs or aircraft on floats may be able to carry racks outside. However, external loads can be very tricky and can significantly cut into the total load.    Lots of people ask us if we can fly around the area so they can see what's there. We will normally try to give you as much extra look-see time as we can, but if it's more than five or ten minutes we'll probably charge you for it. We'll be happy to set up a separate scouting trip ahead of time if you like, or we can plan to add extra time to your trip out. Nothing makes us happier than to land you within shouting distance of a legal animal — but please don't abuse your advantage and hunt on the same day that we fly you in.     Finally, float hunts — where you raft down a river to a pickup point — are increasingly popular, and Alaska is full of floatable, huntable rivers, many of which are accessible by air. However, float hunts can be very tricky to plan, especially if you haven't done one before. There are several rafting companies that will help you plan or rent equipment or even provide a guide. For the flying part, expect one 185 or 206 load for each raft, including one person and some gear, and one or more flights for the rest of the people, usually up to three per plane. A Beaver, of course, can take more. By the way, many float trips are flown in on wheel planes to nearby strips or sandbars. And for some rivers, we may insist that you use a guide before we'll take the responsibility for flying you in and putting you in harm's way.    All of what I've discussed isn't meant to put you off. An unguided fly-in trip is arguably the cheapest way to get into some superior hunting if you don't have your own airplane (or a friend with one). The average air taxi operator — including our company — will bend over backward to help you out. But it's a two-way street, and the more you help yourself, the more we can help you.    Top of Document       Fly-in Hunting from the Hunters Point of View    by Tom Reale     Alaska is one of the world's premier hunting and fishing destinations. However, some prospective visitors are a bit unclear on just how vast the hunting areas are, and how roadless the state is. Unfortunately, there isn't a moose behind every tree or a caribou over every hill, and roadside streams aren't (usually) bursting with fish just waiting to be caught. Getting to prime areas usually involves flying into an area that's off the road system. As some folks have observed, getting from their homes to a good hunting area involves a series of trips in smaller and smaller airplanes.    Once you've decided what you want to hunt, get a copy of  The Alaska Atlas and Gazetteer . This handy book has large-scale topographic maps of the entire state, showing prominent geographic features, contour lines, bodies of water, etc. Looking over these maps will give you a general idea of what the terrain is like, how far it is from the road system or nearest town to your hunting area, etc.     Finding a Flight Service     Your next assignment is to find a pilot or flight service that serves your prospective hunting area. There's no substitute for talking to someone who has been there and done that, and it's almost a dead certainty that you know someone who knows someone who has used an Alaska flight service. However, should that avenue fail you, read the ads in sporting magazines and a copy of the guide and transporter roster from the State of Alaska and start making calls and asking questions. You want information such as: How long has the operation been in business under the current ownership? Who flies for you and for how long? How much flying time in Alaska do their pilots have? Can you get the names of recent clients for reference purposes? Does the flight service transport hunters routinely, or just as a sideline? A series of such questions will enable you to get a feel for the operation. If the person on the other end of the phone gets huffy or defensive, move on. Early warning signs should never be ignored.    Another consideration is whether you want to fly with a large, multi-plane outfit or a small one- or two-plane operation. On the one hand, the smaller outfit can give you personal attention and tailor its operation more closely to your requirements. Conversely, a bigger company will have a greater variety of plane types at its disposal. They'll have more planes operating in your area to provide mid-hunt checks and opportunities to change locations if you're unhappy with your first choice. They can usually offer an optimal fit between the size of your party and the size of the airplane    Rates are set a couple of different ways. Larger operations that fly frequently to certain destinations often charge a seat fare — a fixed rate per seat, just like a scheduled airline. For example, if Ketchum Air Service takes you caribou hunting to the Mulchatna herd from Anchorage, it's going to cost about $1,295 per person. That covers just about everything — meat hauls, mid-hunt checks, additional flying time if weather forces a detour of flight routes, etc.    The more common method with smaller outfits is to charge a per-hour charter rate where you pay for every hour the engine is running to get you out to your hunting spot and back, as well as the time the plane is deadheading. If your destination is an hour away from the airfield, your round-trip cost is going to be four hours at the per-hour rate — an hour out to drop you off, an hour for the plane to return home, then repeat for the pickup. This total is divided up among the passengers.    Ask about airplane sizes and capacities. Sometimes paying more for a larger plane can save money if it means fewer trips. For example, if the flight service charges charter rates and flies a smaller plane such as a Cessna 180 and you've got three people in your party, chances are that multiple trips will be made to ferry you, your gear, and your animals back and forth. However, a larger plane such as a deHavilland Beaver might be able to do it all in one trip each way. Likewise, if you're a two-person party with minimal gear, the $350 plus per hour rate of a Beaver might be overkill.    Once you've tentatively settled on a flight service, you can check with the National Transportation Safety Board website for the flight service's accident history. As one pilot said, “Everybody gets a ding once in a while, but if you're looking at an outfit that has accidents every year, you might want to reconsider.”    Ask questions! Don't assume that your pilot or dispatcher knows what you want to do or how you want to do it. Clarify everything before you leave base. Is there a chance you'll either want to come out early or stay later than your intended pickup time? Do you want a fly over to see if you've got meat to come out? Ask if you'll have to pay extra for meat hauls, and if so, how much. Policies vary between different outfits. Find out if boning out the meat is legal in the area you'll be hunting, and if the flight service recommends doing so to reduce weight. Do you want the option of moving camp in case your first choice doesn't pan out, and how much extra will a move cost? Remember that you can't hunt the same day airborne, so moving camp involves at least one day of lost hunting possibilities, more if it takes time to strike, move, and set up your camp again. Should any meat that's flown out early go to the local processor? If so, what specific instructions do you have for the processor? Does the flight service have your home contact info, and do you want them notified if you're going to be late coming out? Do you have an airline connection to make at the end of your trip, and if so, how important is it for you to make it? Many questions go unasked and unanswered because the clients don't know enough to ask the proper questions or because the operators are so used to the day-to-day details of their business that it doesn't occur to them that anyone might not know the answers already.    Ask about scouting — usually you can arrange for a short session of flying over the hunt area to give you the lay of the land. This is time and money well spent since your viewpoint changes radically once you're on the ground and your plane has disappeared over the horizon. You're left standing in a strange and very quiet place with a mound of gear and only a dim idea of what's where. Beware of a pilot's description of how easy it'll be to get from point “A” to point “B” unless he's actually been on the ground and done it himself. Pilots can be a bit cavalier about trekking over areas that look easy enough from the air but prove to be problematic once you're confronted with hard realities.    Ask about other fishing and hunting possibilities in the area beforehand. You can probably fish or hunt birds, and if you don't take the necessary gear, you could miss out on some exceptional sporting potential.    Finally, realize that a flight service is a mode of transportation. They're prohibited by law from aiding hunters in the field — they can't set up camp, haul meat, or as one pilot was requested to do, haul a dead caribou out of a lake with a rope attached to his airplane. Nor can they spot game from the air and report back to you. They usually know some of the better locations and can put you close to good spots, but after that, you're on your own. If you want a fully guided hunt, make arrangements with a licensed guide and be prepared to pay lots more for your hunting trip.     Pre-Hunt Preparations     Information Sources    Check the  National Transportation Safety Board  for accident reports on flight services and pilots.    Write to the Dept. of Community & Economic Development, Division of Occupational Licensing, Box 110806, Juneau 99811, include a check for $5, and ask for the guide roster. This lists all the licensed guides, outfitters, and transporters in the state.     Call the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game at 907-267-2347 to order copies of the current  hunting regulations .    For the  Alaska Atlas and Gazetteer , contact  DeLorme Mapping  or call 800-227-1656, ext. 7000. Price: $19.95 + shipping.     USGS topographic maps are available from local dealers, or order from the  USGS website , or call 1-888-ASK-USGS (275-8747).  Get a copy of the current game regulations from Fish and Game, and order the appropriate topographic maps. The maps in the Gazetteer aren't detailed enough for use in the field — you'll need to purchase more detailed maps from the USGS. The flight service can supply the names of the maps you're most likely to need. The large “section” maps, (1:250,000 scale) will suffice, but if you can pin down your location well enough to get the smaller quadrangle maps (1:63,360), you'll have more and better detail.    Alaska is divided into 26 game management units and numerous subunits with differing season dates, species restrictions, etc. It's your responsibility to know where you are and know the regulations for that unit. Have with you and know how to use a topo map, the hunting regulations, and a GPS receiver, if possible. Crossing a stream or a ridgeline can put you into a different unit, and you need to know with precision where you are. The maps of the GMU's and physical descriptions of each unit in the regulations book are rudimentary and no substitute for a topo map. Outline the GMU boundaries on your topo maps before you leave home so you're sure of your location relative to the boundary lines when you get on the ground. Gear choice and packing is an art.     When flying in to a remote camp, you have to balance two very different ideas. On the one hand, you're going to be cut off from civilization for a while, so you need to be completely self-sufficient during your time afield — no hopping into the truck for a quick run to the store for matches, stove fuel, or food. On the other hand, you have to be weight-conscious — the kitchen sink is going to have to stay in the kitchen. Large coolers packed with ice and beer, hard-sided luggage, and comfortable camp furniture are, for the most part, out of the question. Pilots prefer several small, soft-sided duffels to one large, ungainly package.    Alaska real estate is often soggy, even in wide open, apparently dry tundra, so hip waders are essential. If you limit your mobility by wearing only ankle- or calf-high hunting boots, you're likely to miss out on some opportunities. There are streams, ponds, and boggy patches everywhere, and your once-in-a-lifetime trophy is very likely to be on the other side of one. Some outfits rent waders and other camping gear, but you're usually better off bringing your own so you can be sure of availability, quality and fit.    Pack a couple of sizes of blue tarps — they're handy for keeping meat dry, they're the standard pickup signal for pilots, and they'll double as emergency shelters if things get nasty. Bring pack frames, stout cord and a pack saw so you can construct a meat pole, and extra food and stove fuel in case you get weathered in.    Before leaving, find out approximately where you'll be, and leave that information, along with the flight service's contact info, with someone at home, along with your expected time of return. It's a good idea to allow a day or two before you fly in to buy last-minute items, licenses, etc., and a day or three at the end to allow for time lost due to weather in getting out of the field.    Don't ask your pilot to break any rules, push the weather, or compromise his or her judgment. That weather front moving in doesn't care a bit about how important you are at your place of business or how much money you'll lose if you don't make your airline connection.    There are a couple of areas of misunderstanding with first-time fly-in hunters. The first is the amount of gear you're going to need in the field. According to one flight service owner, moose hunters seem especially prone toward over packing with canned and frozen food and comfort items. This presents problems in getting it all into the airplane and getting the airplane into a good spot for you to hunt. Mike Bowers, chief pilot for Ketchum's, said, “The performance of the plane is to a great extent determined by its weight. If there's a small lake where the hunting is good, I might not be able to get in there if the plane is too heavy. If we're light, it increases my choices on where to put you.” A maximum of 125 pounds per hunter is allowed by many outfits, and if you can carry less, so much the better. Bring dried foods and go over gear lists with the other members of your party to avoid duplication.    Finally, Paul Englund, owner of Susitna Air Service near Willow, says the most common complaint he hears from hunters coming out of the field, is, “I didn't think it'd be that hard!” Big game country is usually either thick and wet, steep and wet, or wide open, hummocky and wet. Alaska real estate seldom makes for easy hiking, and when you add the size of the animal, there's lots of hard work involved. Be prepared to expend serious effort to make the most of your Alaska hunting experience.    If you do your homework, communicate clearly with your prospective flight service, and keep your expectations reasonable, your hunting trip is sure to be an enjoyable and successful venture.     Top of Document       Changing Views On Brown Bears In Alaska   by Nonna Shtipelman, Fish & Wildlife Technician      Exterminate Brown Bears!   Brown bears serve no good purpose. They are essentially killers — the bear ought to be exterminated — and the extermination ought to begin at once.   “Exterminate Brown Bears,”  Daily Alaska Empire  21 October 1929.       Our perspectives on brown bears have certainly changed since the publication of this editorial, following the attack and subsequent death of US Forest Service timber cruiser Jack Thayer. Pick up a copy of  Alaska Bear Tales , and it's clear that bear attacks — however rare or sensationalized — still grab us just as sure as Bart the Bear grabs unsuspecting hikers in popular movies like  The Edge .    Most of us have bear tales of our own. And while every bit as exciting as  Alaska Bear Tales , most bear-human encounters are brief, tense and often over before one gets a good look at the other. The  Stan Price State Wildlife Sanctuary , located at the mouth of Pack Creek on northeast Admiralty Island, offers a very different kind of experience.     One of several bear viewing areas statewide, Pack Creek has a long history of use. Chosen as a viewing area by the USFS in the 1930s, the immediate drainage was closed to bear hunting in 1935 and extended to include neighboring Swan Cove and Windfall Harbor in 1984. The sanctuary itself, named for longtime homesteader Stan Price, the “bear man of Pack Creek,” was created by the State Legislature in 1990 and is managed cooperatively by the USFS and ADF&G.     Pack Creek has a long history of use. Chosen as a viewing area by the USFS in the 1930s, the immediate drainage was closed to bear hunting in 1935 and extended to include neighboring Swan Cove and Windfall Harbor in 1984. Each summer, up to 25 bears take advantage of the estuary and tide flat, feeding on sedges and spawning salmon. After nearly 70 years of human presence, Pack Creek bears have grown accustomed or “habituated” to people. This provides an unique opportunity to watch them feed, fish, and interact with one another while paying very little attention to people. However, habituated bears are still wild and comfort levels vary. To minimize our impacts to bear behavior, visitors are limited to one of three areas — viewing spit, observation tower, or food cache.     Though best known for its bears, Pack Creek is home to a variety of other wildlife as well. Be sure to look for bald eagles, ravens, and gulls scavenging salmon along the creek. Listen for hermit thrushes, winter wrens, and fox sparrows. Watch for Sitka black-tailed deer along the forest edge and harbor seals making their way up the creek at high tide.    A permit is required to visit Pack Creek from June 1 to September 10. Access is limited to 24 permits per day during Peak Season (July 5 – August 24); however, an unlimited number of permits are issued during the Shoulder Season (June 1 – July 4 and August 25 – September 10). Contact the Forest Service (907-586-8751) for a permit application. Applications should be postmarked no earlier than February 20, with permits awarded on a first-come, first-served basis beginning March 1. Permit application packets also include a list of charter operators and commercial outfitter/guides.    Top of Document       ADF&G Wildlife Information Centers    by Jim Holmes, Wildlife Technician Anchorage Information Center    The Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Wildlife Conservation maintains several public information centers around the state. The largest of these centers are located in Fairbanks and Anchorage. The Anchorage Information Center is located at 333 Raspberry Road and is part of the Anchorage Fish and Game office. Information Center hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. The Anchorage Information Center serves more than 30,000 visitors annually and offers a wide array of materials related to hunting and wildlife viewing.    Centers are staffed with knowledgeable personnel who are more than happy to assist the public. Staffers help local and out-of-state hunters with all aspects of  hunt planning . They are very up to date on  hunting regulations , game populations, methods, previous  harvest information , equipment, fly-in hunts, etc. They also have handouts for the public with information ranging from  birdhouse building  to handling  problem moose  in your neighborhood.      During hunting seasons, the Information Centers stay busy assisting hunters in interpreting game regulations, sealing bears, measuring antlers and horns, and answering a variety of questions related to hunting. Information Center staffers assist in filling out permit applications, proxy forms, senior and disabled license applications, harvest reports, and many other hunting-related documents.    In addition, our Information Centers have large map displays for public viewing and many free publications and brochures. The Anchorage Information Center sells hunting and fishing licenses and big game tags. The Division also recently acquired several  hunting-related videos , which can be bought or rented through the Information Center. Another service provided is information on wildlife viewing around the state.     Centers are stocked with maps and brochures to assist the public in finding locations where wildlife may be viewed and photographed. Staff members are also very well informed on wildlife habits and viewing areas and enjoy sharing this information with the public. The Anchorage Information Center can be reached by phone at (907) 267-2347 or fax at (907) 267-2433. The Fairbanks Information Center phone number is (907) 459-7213.

JAKES Day Comes to Alaska   Reducing Barriers — Wanted: New and Younger Hunters   Okay, You Shot It, Now What?   Bear Hunting Update   Supertramp   The Joy of Packing Game   Women in the Outdoors   How to Select a Guide   Great Gear for Alaska Hunters       JAKES Day Comes to Alaska   by  Tony Monzingo , Hunter Services Coordinator    National Wild Turkey Federation volunteers teach JAKES the fine points of using a variety of turkey calls. JAKES, a term usually applied to an immature male wild turkey, is also the acronym used as the name of the National Wild Turkey Federation's (NWTF) youth program. JAKES stands for Juniors Acquiring Knowledge of Ethics and Sportsmanship. The JAKES is a nationwide program helping to introduce thousands of youngsters to outdoor field sports as well as ethics and sportsmanship necessary to preserve our hunting heritage.   The Department of Fish and Game, and the local chapter of the NWTF held Alaska's first JAKES day on April 29 at the Rabbit Creek Range. Sixty-four youngsters, boys and girls ages 9-14, attended and took part in the festivities including loading and shooting muzzleloaders, shooting clay targets, archery, rifle marksmanship, calling wild turkeys, conservation games, and a retrieving dog demonstration.   At the 2000 National Wild Turkey Federation national convention, held in Nashville, officials from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and Wild Turkey Federation signed a memorandum of agreement. This agreement pledges cooperation to promote responsible, ethical hunting, shooting sports, and hunter education to the youth of Alaska. Ken Taylor, Director of Habitat & Restoration for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, was instrumental in forging this exciting and dynamic new partnership.   Dean Hughes, president of the Tundra Toms, working closely with Hunter Information and Training event coordinator Cathy Sabrowski, secured broad support for the JAKES's event. JAKES was a rousing success due to the cooperation of several Southcentral Alaska sportsmen's organizations including Ruffed Grouse Society and Safari Club International. Hughes and Sabrowski also obtained numerous contributions from local businesses and individuals who joined the effort as partners to introduce kids to the shooting sports.   Every youngster attending JAKES Day had the opportunity to learn basic shotgun shooting skills with the help of certified coaches. Virtually every shooter was successful in hitting the swiftly moving clay targets. When the big day came, NWTF member Cindy Hughes registered every kid, and then they were provided a JAKES T-shirt, a one-year membership in JAKES, and a surprise bag full of JAKES materials. Event coordinator Cathy Sabrowski organized the kids into six groups for the day's activities. According to Sabrowski, many parents volunteered to spend the day as group chaperones, accompanying their group from station to station. As a result, Sabrowski said, “Thanks to the parents and other volunteers, the activity rotation schedule ran smoothly.”   At the turkey calling station, the JAKES were treated to a demonstration of the various types of turkey calls including box, friction, diaphragm, and shaker calls by David Hobby, an experienced turkey hunter. Each youngster then had the opportunity to practice the basic turkey sounds of clucks, yelps, and purrs on all the various calls. According to David, the new JAKES learned to appreciate the variety of sounds made by wild turkeys and practiced the skill necessary to convince a turkey to come to a call.   Participants attended a wildlife conservation station where activities were drawn from the Project Wild books and The Alaska Wildlife Curriculum. These activities focused on teaching the concepts of carrying capacity, limiting factors, and the essential elements of survival for two different animal species. During one activity, kids played a survival game, which used food and space as limiting factors of a bear population. The kids, as bears, had to collect cards representing pounds of  food . “The amount of food collected in a certain area helped kids realize the number of bears that area could support,” said Holli Apgar, activity instructor.   In another activity, participants represented a population of moose that came into contact with many different problems that moose face in the wild. Food, water, shelter, and people were all used in this activity to show how a population of animals can fluctuate from year to year. “These activities showed kids that there are many different factors involved in the survival of animal populations. The unexpected visit of a moose in the area and the discovery of moose bones and tracks reinforced this activity,” stated Apgar.   The entire day was a huge success. The JAKES were extremely courteous, well-behaved, and responsible in handling firearms. Sabrowski says she is looking forward to partnering with the Wild Turkey Federation and other sportsmen's organizations to conduct an even bigger event for 2001. If you have a youngster aged 9 to 14 and would like to place their name on a mailing list for future JAKES events, call (907) 267-2393. At the rifle marksmanship station, instructors James Holmes and Brian Hill assisted the youngsters in quickly mastering the basics of range safety, sight picture, trigger, and breath control. After this introduction the JAKES went to work on the paper targets, shooting groups for various prizes including multi-purpose tools, binoculars, and knives.   Ted Blankenship, Paul Arns, and Cathy Sabrowski teamed to teach the muzzleloading station. Knight® Muzzleloading provided youth-sized muzzleloaders, and plenty of Pyrodex® propellant was provided by the Hodgdon® Powder Company. Ted and Paul reported that the kids were really impressed by their ability to quickly learn how to safely load and fire the muzzleloading rifles.   When each group arrived at the archery station, Curtis Lynn and other members of the Alaska Bowhunter's Association teamed to teach the kids how to use a recurve bow and shoot the instinctive method. Participating youngsters then had plenty of time to shoot the 3-D animal and bullseye targets. The young archers were also given the opportunity to try out youth-sized compound bows similar to those used by hunters and competitive archers.   John Matthews served as chief instructor for the shotgun shooting station. Every JAKE shot clay targets using 20 gauge semi-automatics by Beretta, Remington, and Benelli. “I really enjoy introducing kids to shotgun shooting because they haven't developed any bad shotgun shooting habits and really try hard to follow directions,” Matthews said. “As a result, almost every JAKE was able to hit a moving clay target by the third attempt.”   Tim Baker provided a retrieving dog demonstration featuring his well trained chocolate lab, Mocha. Instructors and students alike took a break for lunch. A lunch of hotdogs, chips, baked beans, potato salad, cookies, and juice was provided by local businesses including Fred Meyer, K-Mart, and McDonalds. Lunch was prepared and served by National Wild Turkey Federation volunteers.   During the lunch break, JAKES were treated to an entertaining and educational retrieving dog demonstration conducted by Tim Baker. The demonstration featured Tim's chocolate colored lab Mocha. Tim and Mocha demonstrated how retrieving dogs locate downed birds by sight and also by following the trainer's hand signals. JAKES were impressed by Mocha's efficiency in finding dummy ducks and gave her a big ovation. Everyone also learned that a well-trained retriever is a great conservation tool because the retriever helps find wounded birds as well as birds that land well out in a lake or pond.   Sabrowski noted that the entire day was a huge success; the JAKES were extremely courteous, well behaved, and responsible in handling firearms. Sabrowski says she is looking forward to partnering with the Wild Turkey Federation and other sportsman's organizations to conduct an even bigger event for 2001. If you have a youngster age 9 to 14 and would like to place their name on a mailing list for future JAKES events contact  Cathy Sabrowski  (907) 267-2393.   Top of Document       Reducing Barriers   Wanted: New and Younger Hunters   by  Tony Monzingo , Hunter Services Coordinator    National statistics regarding hunter recruitment are alarming. The absolute numbers of hunters nationwide slightly increased until the late 1990s but not as fast as the general population. As a result, the percentage of people in the United States who hunt has continued to decrease. Barely 7 percent of the general population now calls themselves hunters. The decreasing percentage of hunters is likely to result in continued loss of political influence on wildlife issues and ultimately loss of hunting opportunities.   Casey Willis uses the internet to learn more about ammunition. The internet makes Hunter Ed available at the click of a mouse. One of the chief reasons for the decline is the continued loss of young hunters. Since the late 1980s the number of hunters under the age of 16 has decreased more than 50 percent.   The average age of a hunter in the United States is 42 and climbing. Studies by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reveal that many individuals begin to leave the ranks of hunters once they reach the age of 55. The first of the baby boomers, who make up 40 percent of all hunters nationwide, are now 54 years old. It doesn't take a tree full of owls to know that if the number of young people entering the ranks of hunters is lower than the number of older hunters leaving the ranks that hunters themselves will become a threatened species by 2020.   Ah, you say, Alaska is different. Unfortunately, this is just not true. The percentage of the general population in Alaska that hunts is approximately 14 to 18 percent. In Alaska, fewer than 7 percent of all hunters are under the age of 16. The “average” Alaska hunter is a bit younger than his outside counterpart. One-third of Alaska hunters are 41 to 50 years old. In absolute numbers this means about one out of every six Alaskans hunts. This percentage keeps Alaska toward the bottom of the top ten hunting states. Wyoming, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, and even Pennsylvania top Alaska in the percentage of the population that hunts.   The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), representing almost all the major manufacturers of sporting firearms and accessories, is leading the charge to help recruit new hunters, retain our current hunters, and keep our hunting heritage alive for future generations. Among the key strategies identified by the NSSF to aid in recruitment are mentorship programs for hunters who have recently moved into a new state, increased access to hunting habitat, youth hunts, and providing more convenient access to basic hunter education courses.   Curtis Lynn of Alaska Bowhunters Association looks on as JAKES take aim at 3-D archery targets. For most JAKES this was their first experience with a real bow. Judging from their shooting form, they quickly learned the basics. Youth hunts usually set aside a specific area and a few days for hunters below the age of 16. States that have implemented limited youth-only hunts are beginning to show some increase in the number of youth interested in hunting. Some states sponsoring youth hunts help match prospective teen hunters with an experienced adult mentor. This makes it possible for prospective young hunters who live with non-hunting parents to try the sport and have a fair chance at early hunting success. Youth hunts are so popular that a majority of states has now adopted this recruiting tool.   You would think that any strong opposition to the youth hunts would come from anti-hunting groups opposing any recruitment of new, young hunters. Unfortunately, that thought would be wrong. The most vocal and intense opposition to youth hunts has come from adult hunters. According to both Arizona and Wyoming Game and Fish Department spokesmen, initial proposals for youth hunts were opposed by hunters who didn't want kids to “take their elk” even though Arizona set aside only 400 out of 12,000 elk permits (3 percent) and two areas for the 4-day kids' hunts.   If hunting is really not just about killing animals, then reasonable, mature, adult hunters must realize that public hunting is likely to be in real trouble unless we are unselfish enough to share opportunities with the next generation. It will not save hunting if only the children of today's hunters hunt. Active recruitment of urban young people, both male and female, is needed to preserve our heritage. Alaskan hunters would be well served to show leadership in developing opportunities for young people to experience the thrill and excitement of the hunt.   A second strategy to make hunting more accessible is to provide new hunters with a variety of ways to acquire their hunter education certificate. At the present time most basic hunter education courses are 22 to 24 hours in length. Classes are commonly taught on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule for two weeks.   The National Shooting Sports Foundation has identified these lengthy hunter education courses as a potential barrier to those who would like to become hunters. Taking up four week-nights is too often a burden on potential hunters of school age. Most potential young hunters are also active in organized sports such as baseball, soccer, hockey, and basketball. Most of the games and practices are scheduled after school and on weeknights, conflicting with hunter education course schedules.   When young people have to make a choice they often choose to participate with their friends and peers on the athletic field and too often postpone taking that important first step in becoming a safe and responsible hunter. Other youngsters simply can't afford to give up four nights of school studies and homework to attend another class that requires homework. By high school age the demands on time are even greater, with increasing social activities added to busy academic and recreational sports schedules.   Hunter education experts from across the nation have analyzed these traditional-length courses and identified a number of areas where time could be trimmed without compromising the key messages of basic firearm safety, wildlife conservation, and the hunter's responsibility to the wildlife resource. Recommendations for improving hunter education delivery include providing potential students with a variety of delivery systems designed to fit our busy lifestyles.   The Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Hunter Information and Training Program is a national leader in seeking to provide alternative methods for delivering basic hunter education. Working closely with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the International Hunter Education Association and key Alaskan hunter education instructors, the Hunter Information and Training Program is developing exciting new delivery systems that will make access to basic hunter education easier for both urban and rural students.   Homestudy courses are being adopted by many progressive state hunter education programs as an alternative system for delivering basic hunter education courses. Colorado, Texas, and Nevada have used home study for several years. Studies of hunter education course graduates in these states have shown that there is no statistical difference between the knowledge acquired through home study and that obtained in a traditional course. Subsequent studies show that home-study hunters are every bit as safe as their traditional-course counterparts. In fact, since homestudy has been implemented, hunting fatalities in Colorado have declined to an all-time low.   One key advantage of home study is that the student controls the pace and schedule of learning. This flexibility can reduce interference and conflict with school and athletic activities. Some students may finish in eight hours while others will take 15 to 20 hours to master the written material. To make access to the home study course even more convenient, Alaska Department of Fish and Game's hunter education staff will initiate the planning necessary to have the course available on the Internet. Students could then access the course anywhere in Alaska, at any time. After completing the home study manual, students also complete a day-long field course.   The field course is competency based, which means that students must demonstrate the skills needed to carry a firearm safely into the field and in the presence of other hunters, backpackers, bikers, and hikers. It only takes a few minutes for a trained hunter education instructor to determine if the student has truly read and understands the basic firearm safety rules.   Field courses are made up of several “stations” where students demonstrate the ability to safely enter and exit a vehicle or boat with an unloaded firearm, cross obstacles such as streams, and make the proper choice in “shoot-don't-shoot” situations. The final station of a field course is live fire. The purpose of the live fire is to ensure that students can control the muzzle of a loaded firearm, assess the students' understanding of a basic sight picture, and reduce wounding loss of game. Students must show the instructor that they can safely load and unload a firearm with the proper ammunition. Students then take five shots at a stationary target. If they can place four out of five shots in a group that is equivalent to an 8-inch group at 100 yards they will receive their hunter certification card, good for life in all 50 states. John Matthews, Alaska state coordinator for hunter education, says that the Alaska home-study hunter education course may be available by January 1, 2001.   Another method of delivering the basic hunter education course is by videotape. Since most homes, even those in rural areas, have a VCR, this makes a videotape course accessible to most Alaskans. Because the presentation of information on a video can be carefully scripted and edited, the 20-plus-hour traditional course can be shortened to 3 or 4 hours. The prospective new hunters can view the videotapes at their convenience and complete a student workbook that reviews key questions and concepts. The student can then take the field course to complete the basic hunter education certification.   For hunters in a real hurry, the Hunter Information and Training Program is gearing up to provide a “challenge” course that will be chiefly available in the major population centers. Many Alaskan hunters who travel outside to hunt for the first time find that they cannot purchase a license in many states without possessing a valid hunter education card. Too often this realization comes only a few weeks or days before their departure date. A “challenge” course would work a lot like getting a driver's license. You pick up a student manual, study the manual, and report to a Fish and Game office to take a written test. Once you have passed the test, you report for a field day. If you pass the field course, including live fire, you can receive your hunter education certification on the spot. The traditional course will continue to be available for hunters who prefer the structure and format of the classroom setting.   The success of these alternative delivery systems relies on a core group of highly trained volunteers who will conduct the competency-based field days. These dedicated volunteers will assess the student's understanding of firearms safety rules and their ability to physically and mentally control a firearm under often difficult field situations.   Live fire testing will also aid the Hunter Information and Training Program's hunter education partners. Shooting sports programs such as conducted by 4-H, the Boy and Girl Scouts, and the NRA can provide private sector training in the basic marksmanship skills for those young hunters who need additional training to complete the live fire portion of the basic hunter education field course.   Ultimately the purpose of these alternative delivery systems is to reduce the chance that potential hunters might perceive hunter education as a barrier to the recruitment of new hunters. Hunting accidents and fatalities are at an all-time low in states where hunters must complete a basic hunter education class. Alternative delivery methods must provide greater access to hunting while preserving these hard-earned gains in safety and public attitudes towards responsible hunters.    Top of Document       Okay, You Shot it, Now What?    by  Steven Levi     You see them every hunting season. They're called a lot of things, “city bumpkin” is the term coined by Alaska humorist Warren Sitka. It's also the most descriptive term. These are the hunters who are hell-bent for leather to shoot something but don't have the slightest idea what they are going to do with the game once they bag it. They hit the tundra with harvest tickets and hunting license, and can't wait to pepper the landscape, plugging away at anything that moves — even if it's trees bending in the wind. Then, if they're lucky enough to actually get a moose or caribou, they end up leaving half the meat on the ground and giving the other half to their wives with the words, ""Well, I shot it, dear. Now it's up to you to clean it and cook it.""   Unfortunately there are more of these hunters than you would imagine. From the trophy hunter who only wants the rack to the highway warrior who refuses to shoot anything further away from blacktop than eyeshot, these individuals make it bad for everyone else. They leave too much meat in the field, don't properly care for the meat they bring home, and expect everyone to compliment them on being great hunters but would never think about handling the game any further than the back of their pickup in their garage.   Big game guide, Bob Wener, demonstrates how to take care of a trophy moose in the field. Knowing what to do in the field ensures a better steak on the dinner table. “Perhaps the single most important thing to remember about hunting,” says long-time hunter and outdoorsman Don Lyon, “and let me repeat, the single most important thing about hunting, is understanding that hunting is actually two activities. The first is finding the game. The second is dressing it. When it's on all fours, it's game. After that, it's food. It should be treated like food. A moose on the ground is meals for your family and friends for a year. You should treat that moose with respect. Think of it as 'meals in the round' and remember, your children are going to be eating what you butcher.”   As any experienced hunter will tell you — not that city bumpkins listen — hunting is not something that happens after you tumble out of your car and load your .30-06. It is something that happens long before hunting season starts. First, and perhaps most important, is to tell your spouse you are going hunting. You do this for three reasons. First, to explain why you're sneaking out of the house at 3 a.m. Second, to avoid surprising the family with 600 pounds of moose on the kitchen counter when the plan had been to take the kids to the State Fair. Third, so you have room in your freezer for the 600 pounds of meat you expect to bring back.   Something else you should do long before you leave home loaded for bear is talk to your local game processor. This is particularly important if you've never gone through the process before. Preparing wild game for your table is not something that is done casually. It's an art form. The quality of the meat you end up with depends largely on what you drop on the game processor's counter. If you've never dealt with one before, pay a visit to the processor. Many are former butchers and can give you important tips on what to do with your game between the time you shoot it and drag it into their establishment. Do you know how to age the meat? How much meat should you cut off? What is “clean” when it comes to meat? What will be mixed with your moose to make hamburger? What's the difference between Polish sausage, summer sausage and breakfast sausage? What's mooseroni? What's a hunter's stick? How does your stomach handle Cajun hot links? Do you want jerky? Do some taste testing there in the shop. The last thing you want is 60 pounds of a game pepperoni that your stomach can't hold down.   Then there's the cost. Not all meat processors charge the same or offer the same package deal. Shop around before you get your game and be very careful about choosing a processor on the basis of price. Cheaper is not necessarily better. Remember, you are dealing with something your family will be eating. Their health depends on how well you choose your game processor. Don't save ten bucks and end up with a cheaper product that doesn't taste as good as you'd like. While you're adding up the numbers, be sure to include the cost of vacuum packing, packaging and labeling. Most important, decide where you are going to store the 600 pounds of meat. Plan ahead by thinking ahead.   Once you have secured peace on the home front and know where you are going to take your game, you can start packing for your trip. Like a good scout, be prepared. For anything. Alaska is not known for its consistent sunny weather so plan on doing your field-dressing in the rain. If it's not raining when your game comes down, all the better. But then you've got the flies. Your basic equipment should include a sharp knife for butchering, a bone saw, lots of rope, plastic gloves and game bags. Don't go cheap and use garbage bags. If there are going to be trees in the area where you hunt, you might want to toss in a block-and-tackle arrangement. Paper towels and hand wipes are good to take along as well. Depending on your attitude about bears, pepper spray is a very good idea as well.   In most cases you will not have a choice as to where your game is going down. If you do, right beside the road is best. But that, of course, is the city bumpkin dream. For most hunters, the moose is dropped where it is shot and that's often quite a ways from the road. If you are really lucky, the moose isn't up to its knees in water when it falls over. If it is, you'll have to get out your SCUBA gear.   There are no ironclad rules about field-dressing your game. Every kill is different. Generally speaking — unless you are a city bumpkin — use common sense. Some hunters don't want to skin out their game in the field. They use the hair and hide to protect the meat as they are transporting it back to their vehicle. Other hunters prefer to skin the game on the spot and haul the meat back in game bags. It depends on your preference as well as on where the animal went down. If you can winch the carcass off the ground to bleed the meat, all the better. Keep your game bags handy so you can cover the raw meat as quickly as possible so it won't pick up hair, grass, feces or other items that will make it inedible. If you are working in the body cavity, don't touch the outside of the animal and then put your hand into the raw meat.   Meat is not the same texture on all parts of the animal. Some meat is good for steaks while other makes excellent stew meat. Before you start cutting, make sure you know which meat you want to save as steaks and roasts and which is good for hamburger and sausage. If you don't know, take this graph to your butcher and ask. Now we come to what really divides the professional from the bumpkin: gutting. It's a messy job made worse by the fact that your bullet may have punctured a few vital organs. Open the body cavity carefully. You don't want to open any more internal organs. Start at the anus and slit the skin all the way to the neck. Use your bone saw to cut the pelvic bone and the brisket, the bone connecting the ribs, all the way to the neck. Then reach into the body cavity and cut the wind-pipe. This will allow you to scoop out the guts. It won't be as easy as this article makes it sound but you have to get the guts out and away from the meat in the body cavity as soon as possible. Use your knife to help you get the guts out. Save the heart and liver. But before you plop the liver into your game bag, make sure you have removed the bile sac. You are going to have to cut the sac off so be careful and make sure you don't spill its contents. Move the gut pile as far from the game as possible. It's going to attract flies.   Once you have the guts out, the hard work begins. The best move is to remove the head from the carcass. This will make it easier to work around the game, particularly if the animal has a rack or antlers. Most hunters remove the legs next. One at a time, pull the legs back and cut the meat around the hip and shoulder joints. If the animal is large, you may want to saw off the lower part of the leg to make it easier to transport. Skinning the quarters is at your option. Although the meat weighs less without the skin, it also becomes more easily contaminated with hair, blood, soil, etc. If you do skin it, make sure you put it in game bags. If you don't skin it in the field, make sure you skin the game as soon as possible. The point of keeping the skin on is to protect it while you are transporting it. Leaving the hide on too long will delay cooling and reduce the quality of your meat. For an alternative method of dressing big game watch the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's video   "" Field Care of Big Game .""    Another mistake city bumpkins make is walking back to their vehicles with a load of meat and no firearm. This is a very dangerous move. Think about it. You are carrying raw meat that can be smelled for miles. You also probably have a fair amount of blood on your clothing and possibly some liquid from the body cavity. Thus dressed you are a walking menu card for bears. And in some parts of Alaska the bears are very large and can be aggressive. If you encounter a bear, Alaska law states: You may NOT take a bear or any other wild animal because it is attracted to the animal you have harvested. You may if threatened defend yourself. Contact Fish & Game for more information.   Take as much meat as you can. First, because wild game is excellent on the dinner table and, second, because it's the law. Be sure to bring back the ribs and the backstrap. Once again, be sure to place them in a game bag before you haul them back to the vehicle. Don't just dump the game bags into the back of your truck and feel that you're taking good care of your game meat. Tie the bags down. Make sure there isn't anything next to the game bags that will tear them, like a tire jack. Tie everything down and, if possible, put a tarp over the game. Treat the game with respect; your children are going to be eating it all winter.   This, of course, sounds a lot easier than the butchering actually is. Field dressing takes a lot of time and hauling the meat back to your vehicle is going to take the better part of a day — if you are lucky. Expect to be eaten alive by flies and be very sore for the next week.   It is going to take you a few days to get that meat to the game processor. That's normal and aging is a good idea as long as you do it properly. If you have some special place where you can store the game, keep the temperature about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. A young moose should be kept about five days while larger animals can stay for up to 10 days. If you are planning on using your garage as the aging area, plan wisely. Make sure it is well ventilated and play it safe; keep the car out of the garage for the ten days. A warm car will change the temperature in the garage and if the garage is not well vented — well, you can figure that out for yourself.   Once the game meat has aged, it's time to be processed. Hopefully you have talked with a game processor before you proceed to the next step. Game processors are not going to take meat that has hair, blood, sinews, tundra or fecal matter mixed in with the meat. If the animal was in rut, you're out of luck. The meat also has to be boned. Finally, keep in mind that the hunt isn't over until you've eaten the meat. So play it smart. Don't jam your freezer full of vacuum-packed bags of I-don't-know-what-it-is-but-it's-all-moose.   Schedule your meals so you've eaten all the meat BEFORE you go hunting again. Wild game is not an inexhaustible natural resource. Be smart, shoot only what you can eat, and eat all you shoot.

Top of Document       Bear Hunting Update    by  Kate Persons , Area Wildlife Biologist in Nome     A healthy and probably increasing brown bear population in Unit 22 makes it possible to increase nonresident bear hunting opportunity. In October 1999 the Alaska Board of Game (BOG) increased the number of brown bear drawing permits for Hunt DB685 in Units 22B and 22C from 20 to 27 permits. The number of permits for hunt DB690 in Units 22D and 22E was increased from 5 to 8. The season in Units 22B, 22D and 22E runs from September 1 through May 31, and in Unit 22C the season is September 1 through October 30 and May 10 through May 25. Hunters who are unsuccessful in a fall hunt may return and try again in the spring if they purchase a license and tag for the new year.   In Units 22 and 23, surplus permits that are not issued in the drawing are available on a first-come first-served basis to any applicant who has a valid nonresident hunting license and a nonresident brown bear tag. BOG action in January 2000 now makes it possible for an individual who has won a brown bear drawing permit the previous year for a hunt in Unit 22 or 23 but was unsuccessful, to obtain a surplus permit for the same hunt the following year. Surplus permits for Unit 22 will be available to hunters or their representatives over the counter at the Nome Fish and Game office, and surplus permits for Unit 23 will be available at the Kotzebue Fish and Game office, beginning five days after the drawing.    Top of Document       Supertramp   by  Ace Sommerfeld    Most Alaskans remember when a young man perished along the Stampede Trail in 1992 under mysterious circumstances. I just finished reading a book on the subject. It cleared up some eight-year-old questions and reminded me of hunting trips I've made where things nearly turned fatal.   The book is titled,  Into the Wild  by Jon Krakauer. He chronicles the last years of Chris McCandless, a hapless wanderer who called himself “Supertramp.” After drifting across the Southwest for a couple of years, he decided to make Alaska the ultimate adventure. He was dreamy enough to consider walking from the Parks Highway to the Bering Sea.   He didn't get any further than a few miles past the Teklanika River, where he took residence in an old school bus in late April. On July 2 his journal indicates he was getting weak and decided to return to the highway. The Teklanika had gone from a gentle stream to a raging glacial river. It forced him back to the bus. His condition deteriorated. In early August he mistakenly ate a poisonous plant, and he became physically impaired and unable to fend for himself. About the 18th of August he died of starvation in the bus.   The author is careful not to pass judgement, and I understand why — many of us prefer a solitary campfire in the middle of nowhere, but Supertramp left a message for everyone who considers heading out alone. His life and death can be a checklist of do's and don'ts for all Alaska hunters.   With no disrespect intended, a more fitting title for the book would have been “Into a Bus.” By Alaska standards Supertramp wasn't off the beaten path. An ounce of precaution and even less savvy would have gotten him through one more bungle.   Perhaps Alaska hunters have responded negatively to Supertramp's demise because many of us have been in far worse predicaments, and lived to tell about it. Nobody intends to get in trouble, but quite often hikes “a little way from camp” turn into ordeals we're not prepared to face. Taking nature for granted has cost many lives.   Supertramp set a pattern early in his wanderings which was bound to catch up with him. An earlier reckless canoe adventure into dangerous and unfamiliar regions of Mexico should have taught him the value of a map, but it didn't.   The importance of a map was instilled in me on my first mountain goat hunt in 1976. A faded topo played a major role in saving two partners and me. Buck Green was a veteran goat hunter. Dean Harmon and I were cheechakos. I was 22, four months in Alaska, and ready to try anything. The day before the season we set out in a downpour and camped on a knoll above a glacial stream. A siesta after the five-hour hike seemed like a good idea, but three guys in a tent built for two didn't work. I woke up in a drenched sleeping bag. Dean and Buck were already awake and making plans. Making a fire was impossible. Ten minutes later we were back-tracking. Going downhill this time, we moved faster until the trail hit level ground.   Rain pushed the stream over its banks, and we faced a glacial torrent carrying boulders similar to what Supertramp would face on the Teklanika on July 2, 1992, when he tried to walk out to the highway. Buck's map indicated one option — hug the perpendicular valley wall on the right side. By staying right we avoided the water most of the time, swimming through the icy swirl 20 to 50 yards at a time.   Long stretches of flood water forced us over timbered cliffs three times. Well into the rainy night, the map led us overland to an old box-car the McNutt family had converted into a cabin with a view of Seward across Resurrection Bay. Nine people lived in the cramped quarters for three days until the rain subsided. Helicopters buzzed through heavy clouds searching for us, but we had no way to communicate with them.   Dean never hunted goats again. He knew when to quit. The weather broke and turned cold. Less than a week after the ordeal, Buck and I hiked back up the valley and filled our tags on a superb autumn afternoon. Such is nature and those who hunt in Alaska must remember that if adversity intimidates you, your hunting career will probably be short.   The difference between our trip and Supertramp's folly was basic bush survival every hunter in Alaska must adhere to. His preparation was haphazard. According to the book, he could have crossed the river a half mile in either direction of the Stampede Trail. A map would have shown him a cable and cart spanning the river downstream. He could have walked upstream to braided river bars that would have made fording possible.   I don't know what the weather or river conditions were on July 2, 1992, but some speculation can teach a beginner in glacial river crossing some valuable lessons. Before any more readers scorn me for not using a cable and cart like Mr. Krakauer ten months after Supertramp perished, let's assume that option doesn't exist. As I rack my brain I can't come up with one other cable crossing a river in Alaska. How's that for romantic irony, it's as if the cable were there for him and he didn't know it.   Anyway, back to the serious matter of crossing a glacial river. The depth of a glacial river changes constantly. It may not have made much of a difference for Supertramp what time of day he attempted to cross the bars because of the long July days, but most of our hunting takes place in late August and early September when cold nights slow a glacier's melting. Try to cross as early in the day as possible. I pick spots with several bars to climb onto in order to warm up a bit, catch my breath, and compose myself for the next stretch.   Judging a glacial river's depth is impossible, and sudden drop-offs are common, so I use a walking stick to test depth and steady myself. If I am carrying a heavy or awkward load, I'll lighten it, and make two fords. It's better to make two safe fords than one reckless one.   Rainfall influences a river's conditions. A small river like the Teklanika will swell after several days of rain. If I had time on my hands like Supertramp, I would've set my tent up on a good crossing, and waited for the right moment to make the plunge. A final thought on crossing any river — study ways to avoid fording before the hunt. If it sounds like trouble, find another place to hunt.   I have serious doubts about Supertramp's thoughts of keeping his gear dry. Maybe that's why fording wasn't an option. You can get chilled to the marrow and be okay if you have the ability to build a fire and get dry.   All my preparation for a hunt is centered on getting dry — not keeping dry. You'll always get wet in Alaska. The trick is to get dry at the end of the day or after a river crossing. You can be miserable all day provided you have a high-quality, dry sleeping bag to crawl into.   About a dozen years ago I was above the Toklat River in Denali Park and ran across a small down-filled sleeping bag. In an effort to keep the environment as pristine as possible, I snatched the bag, tote sack and all. Since then the 18-ounce bag has been a permanent fixture in my backpack. On three occasions I've coupled it with a space bag, not blanket, and spent a halfway comfortable siwash alongside a partner who was ready to shoot me for snoring so loud. The thanks I get for keeping bears at bay. Also in my pack are fire-starting gear, heavy wool socks, balaclava, and waterproof mittens that don't leave their plastic bag until I'm desperate.   Supertramp prepared to get himself out of what he got into. Think ahead and behind. “We're getting game no matter what,” has been the death knell for scores of hunters. From overloading aircraft to harvesting game in dangerous places, considering the consequences may save your life.   A common mistake moose hunters make is harvesting an animal too far from a pick-up point. Most of the time it's no more serious than making more work than you bargained for, but it can turn fatal. You run the risk of losing meat, missing your pick-up time, or injuring yourself.   My moose hunting partners set a one-mile limit on packing. A mature bull will yield 500 pounds of boned meat. Two hunters in good shape should be able to complete the task in three or four trips, depending on terrain. Under Alaska game laws, all meat must be retrieved before hide and headgear. I know hunters who left antlers and capes behind after struggling for days to meet the legal requirement of harvesting game.   Hunting Dall sheep and mountain goats takes more planning than hunting other Alaska game animals. They require a tremendous amount of walking, and everything you need to stay alive for a week or more must be on your back. And that's only to get into decent hunting territory.   Keep in mind if you are successful you'll be packing out more than double what came in. It becomes important to keep your in-load to a minimum. My inexperienced goat hunting partner in 1999 cut a 60-pound pack down to 35, including his rifle, before I was through with him.   Try to allow twice the time going out as you need going in. After hiking long days in rough terrain on a meager diet you won't be moving as fast. I have gotten an entire goat and all my gear out in single trips, but it's no fun. Sheep are another story. Unless you have the backbone of a grizzly and the stamina of a sled dog, make two trips.   Supertramp let his ideals get in the way of practical bush thinking. Living off the land and being alone under a northern sky make good Jack London stuff, but when it comes to making a go of it in Alaska, he would have been better off with a Boy Scout manual and partner.   It's possible to hunt solo. Flying out to the peninsula and hunting caribou a few days by yourself isn't foolhardy. To date I've harvested three billies and two rams alone. Those trips took place a long time ago. Nowadays two is not a crowd when it comes to hunting.   Part of the reason I hunted alone was the belief that a partner would be more harm than good. At times I turned into a babysitter, but I have myself to blame for some of it. Choose your partner wisely. Co-workers and bowling buddies can test a friendship on a serious hunt. If you are a novice hunter try to partner up with a veteran the way I did with Buck.   The author points out with a hint of pride how Supertramp lived for nearly four months and all he brought with him was 25 pounds of rice and a .22 rifle. The thought of arrogance was building throughout the book and finally couldn't be avoided with the mention of the rifle.   Supertramp put himself above the law by not purchasing a hunting license like everyone else does. He hunted out of season. From songbirds to moose, everything was there for him to abuse. Imagine shooting a moose with a .22. I'm not saying his disrespect toward other creatures did him in, but arrogance and nature don't mix. Eventually people like Supertramp push the laws too far and pay. Some learn from their mistakes, some don't.   Supertramp put himself above the laws of nature by refusing to plan properly and take the adventure seriously. One topographic map instead of a book by Tolstoy would've lightened the in-load and could have saved his life.   Top of Document       The Joy of Packing Game The Search for the Ultimate Hunting Pack   by  Tony Monzingo , Hunter Services Coordinator    For several days you hunt really hard. As a hunter who respects the animal resource, you choose to hunt on foot from camp or trail — climbing hills, crossing creeks and muskeg, and trudging through tundra tussocks, all the time carrying 10 to 20 pounds of essential survival gear and extra clothes for the rapidly changing Alaska weather. Now you finally find a legal animal, make a skillful stalk and take a well-practiced shot. The “hunt” part of hunting is over. You quickly and competently field dress the animal, keeping the meat cool, clean, and dry. You leave the meat on the bone because it is easier to keep large parts clean and fly-free. Now the hardest work is before you. You must pack the meat back to the trail and to your off-road vehicle or back to camp.   The new Kifaru® game pack. Each pack is custom- ized for individual hunters' gender, weight and height. Every successful Alaskan hunter faces this arduous task. A moose's shoulder, even with the lower leg removed, may weigh 60 to 80 pounds. A moose hind leg may weigh as much as 125 pounds. Although the packing job is always physically demanding, it doesn't have to resemble torture or inflict physical injury.   I'm sure I open myself to suggestions that I'm at least a couple of cards shy of a full deck, but packing meat, in many ways, is my favorite part of the hunt. First, it gives me time to reflect on the fact that the moose, caribou, sheep, or bear is a product of a fragile environment I have helped to conserve and protect by purchasing hunting licenses and memberships in hunter/conservation groups. Second, with nearly every step 1 take, I will be thinking of all the savory meals I can share with family and friends. Third, the hard physical labor helps make me appreciate the effort required to provide natural food for myself and family in a traditional manner. Finally, packing the meat keeps me intellectually aware. Aware that I am not a spectator to nature's life-and-death cycle but have chosen to assume responsibility for taking a life to sustain my own. Hunters don't delegate the difficult and often unpleasant job of taking life to others.   Even with the philosophical and direct physical benefits of packing, there is the practical side of how to haul heavy loads over difficult, uneven terrain without injuring or torturing yourself. Early packframes were not much more sophisticated than a frame of 1-by-2's connected by a ladder of slats, covered with canvas duck and hung on the shoulders with narrow straps. These were as inflexible as sheet iron and about as comfortable. The Spanish Inquisitors could have wished they had thought up something equally tortuous.   Back in the '60s the aluminum packframe took the backpacking and mountaineering field by storm. These frames were lighter and came with comparatively lightweight aluminum tubes shaped somewhat like the human torso, at least some human torsos. They, too, were rigid and not easily adjustable to fit the myriad shapes of the human body. They did come with padded hip and shoulder pads that made carrying heavy loads bearable. Advances to aluminum tube frames have been made, largely in their padding and strapping (“suspension system”), but they essentially remain the same as the originals.   Basic structure of the Kifaru® pack. Backpackers and mountaineers needed a packframe and bag that hugged and conformed to the body. Loads don't shift with body conforming packframes and therefore they provide more stability in difficult terrain. Designers came up with the internal frame pack which has an aluminum or plastic frame sewn inside the pack bag itself. In some versions the aluminum or plastic frame can be partially bent in an attempt to fit individual body contours. For sheep and goat hunters internal frame packs work much better than those with external frames. Moose, caribou, and bear hunters find that internal frame packsacks rarely have the capacity needed to accommodate large loads, there are few lashing points for irregularly shaped loads such as hides and antlers, and the pack bags are made of noisy rip-stop or cordura nylon.   None of these packs was designed with hunters in mind. Patrick Smith, founder and owner of Kifaru®, himself a longtime Alaska hunter, has designed a pack system specifically for hunters. Patrick certainly has the background for the job. If you are familiar with top-of-the-line mountaineering packs, you are well aware of the legendary Mountainsmith® packs. Well, Patrick is the “smith” in Mountainsmith.  According to Patrick, he began to design the Kifaru® Longhunter TM  because he wanted a quality hunting pack that provided comfort and durability. Patrick found, like most of us, that so-called hunting packs just plain hurt when you have to carry heavy loads. Patrick says he chose the internal frame format for his system because “the frames have won over the expedition world. They simply carry more weight more comfortably with a lot more stability and greater durability than external frame packs.”   Being a hunter, Patrick understood the need to have a way to securely carry a rifle, yet have it almost instantly available. Shoulder slings just don't work for a hunter shouldering a pack so Patrick designed the GunBearer TM . The GunBearer TM  consists of a cradle for the buttstock of the rifle and a quick release device to hold the barrel against the pack. The cradle attaches directly to the Kifaru® waistbelt. This places the weight of the gun on your hips, where it belongs for comfort. With the quick release mechanism your rifle can be more quickly employed for use than if you used a conventional rifle sling. The fully adjustable-for-length GunBearer TM  keeps your rifle both handy and secure. Now your hands are free to wade through the alder thickets or climb that sheep mountain.   To keep the pack quiet in the brush, the Kifaru® pack comes with a set of fleece panels to cover the black Cordura TM  nylon packbag. The fleece is even reversible from brown all-purpose camouflage to blaze orange for safety when packing out antlers or horns.   Other standard features include a large interior pocket for a hydration system water bladder or a spotting scope. A bungee cord built into the pack provides a great place to carry your rain gear or insulated jacket, and there is a zippered pocket inside the pack for keys, hunting license, tags, and harvest tickets.   The Kifaru® system also offers a host of accessories for your pack. You can customize your system with a fleece-lined Hand-WarmerPouch® that also protects binoculars, camera, and map, a rifle rain cover for Alaska hunting conditions, a waist belt cartridge pouch, and side pockets for additional capacity.   Well, to the bottom line, how does the Kifaru® work? In a word: great! What I like the most about the Kifaru® is that you can remove the pack bag and, with the CargoChair, lash heavy, messy loads directly to the frame. You can pack 100-plus-pound loads with the Kifaru® system as comfortably as with any other system currently available.   Most of the time when I am hunting away from a base camp I don't want to carry a heavy pack full of gear. I want to carry a fairly light daypack with necessary meat care and survival gear. I also want to carry the clothes necessary for layering in order to meet changing weather conditions. The Kifaru TM  system includes a Top-Pocket that detaches from the main pack bag and attaches directly to the frame for use as a day-pack. Along with the GunBearer TM  this is just the ticket for hunting Alaska big game.   As if all the above were not enough, each Kifaru® is custom-fit for gender, weight, and height. Prices for Kifaru® systems run from approximately $180.00 for a basic frame and duffel to a complete LongHunter TM  system for approximately $525.00. Call or email the folks at Kifaru®; they will provide personal service and a lifetime, no-questions-asked guarantee. Pardon the overuse of a popular phrase but “don't leave home without a good pack.” I know come hunting season, I won't.    Top of Document       Women in the Outdoors   by  Tony Monzingo , Hunter Services Coordinator     Anchorage-based Tundra Toms Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation, the Alaska Chapter of Safari Club International, Southcentral Alaska Chapter of Ruffed Grouse Society, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game combined to fund, organize, and conduct Alaska's first Women in the Outdoors program. Women in the Outdoors is a highly successful program founded by the National Wild Turkey Federation and dedicated to introducing women to outdoor field sports and conservation activities, including shooting sports.   ADF&G staff introduce forty women to muzzleloading. Here, Ashley Dean prepares her muzzleloader for firing at bulls- eye targets downrange. The clinic was held April 25 and 27 at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Rabbit Creek Rifle Range in Anchorage. The Department's Hunter Information and Training Program's activity coordinator Cathy Sabrowski reports the event was a sell-out with 40 women in attendance both days. According to Sabrowski everyone participated in small-bore rifle, muzzleloader, shotgun shooting, and field archery.   The women were divided into four groups of ten. Each group rotated between two one-hour long activity sessions each evening. The activity sessions were separated by a meal prepared by volunteer cooks including Brian Hill, Paul Arns, Jim Sabrowski, and Jeff Sabrowski. Everyone also shared in a specially decorated cake commemorating this first-in-Alaska event.   Instructors for the small-bore rifle shooting were Brian Hill and James Holmes. Brian and James introduced small-bore rifle shooting with a safety briefing and instruction regarding basic sight picture, trigger, and breath control. After this introduction the women practiced their marksmanship at candy suckers and bullseye targets. Everyone then played a game of “kick-the-can,” using empty shotgun shell cases. According to the instructors, the women enjoyed the hands-on opportunity to shoot a lot of rounds of .22s. Participants also learned that small-bore rifle shooting is an inexpensive and fun activity that can be enjoyed by the entire family.   Judging from all the cheering, whoops, and hollers coming from the shotgun shooting cages, everyone had a high rate of success on the clay birds. At the muzzleloading station, instructors Lee Rogers and Cathy Sabrowski briefed participants on the special safety considerations of loading muzzleloaders and handling Pyrodex®, a substitute for blackpowder. Lee and Cathy indicated that everyone quickly caught on to the steps for safely loading and firing the MK-85 rifles provided by Knight® Muzzleloading. Lee and Cathy obviously did a fine job as many women kept their targets to display the fine groups they had shot with these high quality muzzleloaders.   Shotgun shooters took turns breaking clay targets. Instructors Gale McKnight and John Matthews provided each participant with basic safety information and an understanding of the techniques needed to hit these fast moving targets. Travis Hill volunteered to help the instructors by operating the clay target machines so instructors could focus on instruction. Judging from all the cheering, whoops, and hollers coming from the shotgun shooting cages, everyone had a high rate of success on the clay birds.   Many participants had never previously used a firearm. Shooting .22 rifles proved popular because of the low noise and recoil. Some of the beginners, including Kari Slone, proved to have a natural talent to quickly hit small targets with the .22s. Firearm shooters weren't the only ones having a great time and enjoying a lot of success. Elaine Larimer, Jack Frost, and Curtis Lynn led the archery course instruction. After learning how to safely use a recurve bow, everyone had the opportunity to shoot 3-D foam animal targets or bullseye targets. Jack also introduced everyone to compound bows similar to those commonly used in bow hunting.   Cathy Sabrowski said that many local businesses also contributed to the Women in the Outdoors program. According to Sabrowski, Pepsi-Cola, K-Mart, Wal-Mart, Costco, Fred Meyer, Dreyer's Ice Cream, Great Harvest Bread Co. and Pizza Hut made significant food contributions to the program. Door and grab bag gifts were donated by Alaska Club, Alaska Computer Brokers, Inc., Border's Books and Music, FS Air Service, Glacier Brewhouse, Kart-Zone, Moose's Tooth, My Lord's Floral Center, Paint Your Pot, Inc., Peter Glenn, Sea Galley, and Take Flight Alaska.    “Wide-spread community support was recognized and appreciated by all the women in attendance,” Sabrowski said. Special thanks to Dr. Ken Eberle, Dr. Ken Wynne, and National Bank of Alaska for their support toward introducing women to the outdoors. Finally, thanks to our sponsors Leica, Ox-Yoke Originals, Inc., Winchester, and Federal Cartridges for supplying the essential materials that made this program a success.   As a result of the Women in the Outdoors program, many women inquired about regular shotgun shooting opportunities. Cathy Sabrowski is planning to put together several women's teams for a fall clay target-shooting league. Sabrowski has also announced another program dedicated to introducing women to the field sports for the evenings of June 27 and 28 at Rabbit Creek Range in Anchorage. If you are interested in participating in the fall league or the summer clinic please contact  Cathy Sabrowski  (907-267-2393).      How to Select a Guide    Excerpted from  Hunt Alaska    A registered Alaskan guide must accompany hunters who are not Alaska residents or they must hunt with close relatives within the second-degree of kindred who are Alaska residents when hunting brown/grizzly bears, Dall sheep or mountain goats. Also, look in the Alaska Hunting Regulations for definition and a complete list of who qualifies as  second-degree of kindred . Non-resident alien hunters must have a guide for hunting all species of big game.   Guides improve the chance of finding game.    The chances of killing an animal improve if one hires a guide or travels to remote areas. Individuals who lack precise knowledge of game distribution, access and Alaska geography, yet attempt to put together hunts themselves may face frustration and disappointment. On the other end of the scale is the fully guided hunt. It is expensive, but the chances of killing an animal are high. The best guides deliver 80-100 percent for most big game species. In addition, guides are familiar with their areas and possess equipment that the average hunter might not care to purchase for one time use.   However, a guide's knowledge, experience and equipment do not come cheaply. Although figures vary from guide to guide, expect to spend $8,000-$12,000 for a brown/grizzly bear hunt, $4,000-$6,000 for a sheep hunt and $1,500-$3,000 for a goat hunt. Moose and caribou are often part of a mixed bag hunt and prices vary considerably.   The best way to find a reliable guide is by references.    Check among your hunting partners. Have any of them hunted in Alaska before? Or do they know someone who did? Which guide did they use?   Many guides attend outdoor shows and conventions in the “Lower 48” during the winter. They have booths and promotional material. Try to attend one near you. This kind of personal acquaintance will pay dividends later. Ask the guides for references and follow up on them.   Another avenue is the advertising section found in the back of many hunting and outdoor magazines, or in commercial directories. They offer a starting point for identifying guides that specialize in the species or area in which you are interested.   A list of licensed Alaska guides is available. The list includes guide-outfitters and assistant guide-outfitters and the areas for which they are licensed to operate. If you are interested in obtaining the licensed Alaska guide list, contact the  Division of Occupational Licensing . Another source is the Alaska Professional Hunters Association, which represents many guides and outfitters.     Top of Document       Neat Stuff that Really Works Great Gear for Alaska Hunters   by  Tony Monzingo , Hunter Services Coordinator    One of the holy grails of hunting is to find the perfect piece of gear. Most of us use the venerable trial, and mostly error, method of gear selection which leaves us with a closet or even garage full of stuff that just didn't quite work as advertised or hoped. With the permit draw season upon us and another general hunting season just around the corner, lots of hunters are literally gearing up for next hunting season. The Alaska Department of Hunter Information and Training's popular Gear Clinics have all been sellouts, and the aisles of the Anchorage and Fairbanks sportsmen's shows will be clogged with hunters looking for the newest and finest gear.   One of the chief goals of the  Hunter Information and Training Program  is to keep hunters informed and assist them in enjoying every moment in the field. Our staff is always on the lookout for gear that really works when it needs to, not in the living room, but hours or even days from the nearest sporting goods store. For the year 2000 hunting season we have found a few gems of gear that you should take a close look at before your next hunt.   In our Y2K search we focused on several problems with our present gear. We wanted to see if we could find gear that would improve on what we currently use or that would solve a current problem. The first problem we focused on was the need to clearly mark a camp or downed game.   Brunton® Helios TM  Stormproof® lighter has a piezoelectric ignition, no batteries or flints required. The flame reaches an intense 2,000+ º F. When you are hunting from an outboard powered boat or raft on a river it can be difficult to find camp at late dusk, particularly if camp is located off the river in brush or timber, or on a high and dry bank. Since the dusky hours are often the most productive hunting hours, it's hard to quit hunting in time to get back to camp in full light. Lots of hunters have taken the full 50-cent chamber-of-commerce river tour when they passed a partially concealed camp. Some hunters resort to use of a heavy-duty flashlight or spotlight to locate camp as they float downriver. However, even the innocent use of such a light can create suspicion of illegal spotlight hunting or bring about an undue temptation when a bankside game animal appears in the middle of your spotlight beam. Other hunters have resorted to use of an emergency strobe light. These incredibly bright, white flashing lights are certainly easy to locate but should be reserved for actual emergencies, since they can result in a conscientious pilot triggering a needless search and rescue mission.   We also have an office file that contains many reports of hunters returning to previously downed game only to find that a brown bear had laid claim to the carcass. Frequently a game animal goes down in a dense thicket of brush or on a featureless piece of tundra. In either case it is all too easy to stumble onto the kill site when you return for a pack trip to get all the meat or the horns or antlers. The results of such unplanned encounters are often unfortunate for both hunter and bear. In extreme cases hunters have lost their lives to hungry, possessive brown bears. This is a classic situation where an ounce of prevention is worth far more than a pound of cure.   For years we have advocated, and practiced, flagging the site of a downed animal with fluorescent orange or pink surveyor's tape. Most of the time, this strategy works well, and you will spot the flagging in time to exercise utmost caution and make plenty of noise as you approach the kill site for another pack full of game meat. However, there are times on the tundra when there simply isn't anything substantial or tall enough to attach flagging to. In dense brush, even with the aid of a compass or GPS, you may have some difficulty relocating the exact spot and surprise yourself by stumbling onto the flagging, and therefore the kill site, without sufficient warning. Remember, a GPS doesn't give you direction of travel unless you are moving. In difficult terrain you may not be able to move quickly enough for the GPS to properly operate and give you a good bearing back to the downed game.   Three years ago I lost one half of a sheep to a beautiful tricolor grizzly at a Brooks Range camp. The bear was obviously a connoisseur of sheep meat, since it first ate the backstrap. If you crave sweet sheep meat as much as I do, this was no small tragedy. A confrontation was avoided because we had clearly flagged the meat cache. As we returned to camp the bright orange flagging caught my attention. My eyes immediately picked up the bear straddling the willow-thatched meat cache. After circling upwind and lots of noise making and epithets, we watched the bear pick up a ham and stride off into the sunset. (No, the cache wasn't in a tree, since there wasn't a tree within 50 miles.)   Just this past fall three of us were returning to the site of a moose one of our party had taken early that morning.The moose went down in a grove of black spruce. The thick undergrowth consisted of thigh-high dwarf birch. We copiously flagged the site and marked it as a way-point with our GPS. However, a GPS is accurate only to 30 to 50 yards and the dense growth and poor light made finding the flagging difficult. As a result, three of us had to scout around for 5 minutes before someone spotted the flagging.   Two days later another hunting partner downed a moose a short distance from camp and about two hours before dusk. As a result we had to make a second meat-hauling trip just at dusk. Again the flagging became difficult to spot in the semi-darkness.   Dense timber and brush aren't the only times when locating camp can be difficult. Open tundra frequented by large herds of caribou can be almost as featureless as the sea. When you combine the subtleties of the tundra with windswept sheets of rain or fog, locating camp can become an adventure in itself.   We realize these situations are all recipes for trouble and vowed to find a better way to mark a camp or downed game. The solution came from a fellow Alaskan hunter who attended one of our gear clinics. As we discussed the need for marking camp and downed game he recommended a little gem called the Micro-Tracker TM  from Browning. The Micro-Tracker TM  is a 3-inch long xenon-bright, flashing red light powered by two AAA alkaline batteries. The body and lens of the Micro-Tracker TM  are made of virtually unbreakable Lexan®, the material used for football helmets, and sealed with an O-ring making the Micro-Tracker waterproof. The body of the Micro-Tracker is bright yellow, which will help if you drop it in the muskeg or lay it down in soft forest duff.   With a set of fresh batteries the Micro-Tracker TM  will emit bright pulses of red light, which are visible for one mile for as long as 8 to 10 hours, depending on temperature and condition of the batteries. This little gem attaches to almost anything because it has both a clip and a lanyard ring. My hunting partners and I are going to include the $12 Micro-Tracker TM  in our gear for this hunting season. It will help make anyone's hunts more enjoyable and safer.   The SafeWater® filter system of inter- connected, omnidirectional pores, 2 microns in diameter, is so good that it will remove 99+ percent of all bac- teria and protozoans, including the dreaded  Giardia ,  Crytosporidium , and  E. coli . As a bonus, the filter system also removes such dangerous contaminants as industrial wastes, insecticides, lead, and mercury, which can cause a variety of health problems. Another problem commonly faced by hunters is maintaining a safe, potable supply of water for cooking, drinking, and personal hygiene. Most Alaskan hunters find themselves hunting well away from villages, towns, and cities. However, mere distance from civilization does not mean the waters in the ponds, lakes, streams, and rivers will be pure. Almost every natural source of water in Alaska has one or more bad “bugs” that can make you sick and prematurely end an expensive hunting trip.   The most common “bug” is the tiny, microscopic, single-cell cyst of an animal called  Giardia lamblia .  Giardia  is spread into the water from the feces of common Alaska mammals such as beavers, muskrats, moose, caribou, and deer.   Hunters can easily get  Giardia , commonly called “beaver fever,” by drinking contaminated water or even using forks, knives, or other utensils that have been washed in contaminated water. Until just a few years ago, I mistakenly believed that unless you drank contaminated water, you could avoid  Giardia . This misconception was rudely dispelled on a 10-day float-hunting trip on an interior river. My partner and I filtered all our drinking water or treated it with iodine tablets. What we didn't know did hurt us. First, iodine tablets lose effectiveness in the sub-freezing temperatures we encountered. Second, we didn't filter or treat the water we used to wash dishes and eating utensils. We erroneously thought that the hot soapy water would “wash away” the  Giardia . It doesn't. About five days into our trip the typical symptoms of stomach cramps, gas, and diarrhea began. Trust me on this one,  Giardia  can prematurely end a hard-earned hunting trip. Only a round of expensive prescription antibiotics ended the rampaging little critters.   Even at this I think we were lucky. Many remote Alaskan waters also contain a microscopic single cell protozoan animal named  Cryptosporidium . This little beast produces the same basic symptoms as  Giardia  but commonly adds a fever, making you really feel ill.   The most reliable way to prevent both  Giardia  and  Cryptosporidium  is to boil all the water you will use for drinking, washing dishes, personal hygiene, or cooking. Boiling water for a full three minutes will kill both the protozoans and all the viruses in contaminated water. Additional boiling is not helpful and wastes fuel.   The problem with boiling all the water you will need is that it takes a lot of precious, expensive fuel. If you are on a fly-in or backpacking hunt, weight considerations mean that you don't want to haul any more fuel than absolutely necessary. If you try to minimize use of water you will likely end up dehydrated. Dehydration, even mild cases, results in loss of energy, makes you feel colder, impairs the function of the kidneys, and can result in impaired judgment. Doctors tell us that we need to drink at least one gallon of water a day. When we exercise we need to drink even more water. So what's a body to do?   I have found two outstanding, easy-to-use, and reliable products from a Durango, Colorado company called SafeWater Anywhere TM . I made sure to purchase two of each using the Murphy's Law-like philosophy that anything that works too well will go out of production.   The first product is a portable, 1 liter-sized squeeze bottle with an integral pre-filter and filter. The SafeWater® filter system of interconnected, omnidirectional pores, 2 microns in diameter, is so good that it will remove 99+ percent of all bacteria and protozoans including the dreaded  Giardia ,  Cryptosporidium , and  E. coli . As a bonus, the filter system also removes such dangerous contaminants as industrial wastes, insecticides, lead, and mercury, that can cause a wide variety of health problems. If you want to be sure and kill all the viruses too, simply add iodine tablets to the water in your SafeWater® bottle.   To operate the SafeWater® you simply unscrew the bottom of the bottle and dip the bottom in a lake, stream, river, or other water source until the bottle is full. The O-ring sealed cap prevents contamination of the drinking nozzle during the filling process. A 25-micron pre-filter mesh located at the bottom of the squeeze bottle removes most of the sediment and silt (with Alaska's glacial streams and rivers this is a must!). After filling the bottle all you have to do is gently squeeze the bottle and out comes fresh, clean, and healthy water!   A SafeWater® squeeze bottle's filter will treat 200 gallons of water and is easily replaced. The 1-liter size is ideal for hunting where water sources are few and far between. The 1-liter size fits easy in a daypack or an inside coat pocket when the temperatures are below freezing.   Most of us simply don't consume enough liquids when we are hunting. The resulting low-grade dehydration keeps the body from working at peak efficiency. SafeWater® has the answer in the form of a simple In-Line Filter. Simply purchase a hydration bag, usually a tough plastic bag that fits in your daypack or packbag. Hydration bags come with a long tube that reaches over your shoulder and lets you take frequent sips without having to stop and dig out a water bottle. The problem with hydration bags in the Alaska outback has been the fact that you had to fill them with filtered or boiled water. If you ran out during the day, you just got thirsty, and dehydrated.   SafeWater's® in-line filter is installed in the hydration bag's drinking tube. You simply cut the plastic tube, insert the filter, and fill the hydration bag from any river, lake, stream, or other water source. A stainless steel sediment pre-filter will help remove the common sediments and the oft present, flour-fine glacial silt. The filter is easily disassembled to clean a clogged pre-filter. With the in-line filter in place just start drinking! If you want to be sure and kill all viruses, then simply add iodine tablets to the hydration bag. The primary filter will remove all the iodine and iodine taste as well as the “plastic” taste common to hydration bag systems. Like the SafeWater® bottle, the in-line system will filter 200 gallons of water, more than enough for the thirstiest hunter.   The only gap in the SafeWater® line of products is a system that will conveniently filter large quantities of water for general camp use. Kim Rappleye, executive vice president of SafeWater®, says that product will soon be ready for market. According to Kim, SafeWater® will introduce a passive water system that will basically work like a large hydration bag. Simply fill a large plastic bag with water and hang it upside down. The water will filter itself while you are out hunting! Hard to beat a deal like that. No more pumping or scrubbing away at clogged pump filters, and no more  Giardia  or  Crytosporidium .   The third problem I vowed to address is the need for a reliable, intense heat source for starting a fire under severe Alaskan conditions. Every hunter should routinely carry several devices for starting fires, lighting lanterns, igniting stoves, sealing ends of nylon cord, and many other uses in the field. I always carry a supply of strike-anywhere matches in a waterproof container. I also routinely carry a couple of disposable butane lighters. These inexpensive little lighters usually serve the purpose. However, there are times when they balk at lighting or their ignition system fails. More importantly, they simply don't work reliably when the wind is really blowing. Trying to keep a wooden match or a disposable lighter lit on a fall Alaska Peninsula hunt is a study in futility. A contortionist doesn't have anything over the twists and turns a hunter will make with his body attempting to shield a feeble flame from the fickle wind. And then there's the time when you may truly need a hot, wind-proof flame to start a fire for survival.   My search for the ideal source of flame for general hunting purposes and survival has ended. I have added the Brunton® Helios TM  Stormproof® lighter to my pack. In fact, I put one in my survival kit and intend to keep another in a buttoned shirt pocket. The Helios TM  is truly a refined piece of engineering, not merely another butane lighter. There are several key features that make the Helios an indispensable piece of gear. First is the fact that it is almost unfailingly reliable. The Heliostorm has a piezo-electric ignition, no batteries or flints required. The flame reaches an intense 2,000+ degrees Fahrenheit. That is not a misprint. This little sucker is hot and burns so cleanly that in bright light the flame is virtually invisible. When the lighter is ignited, a white glow is visible through a small white ceramic flame window. Do not attempt to verify that the flame is invisible by placing a pinky over the top of the lighter! If you do, the 2,000 degrees will give new meaning to the term “searing heat.” The flame is fully adjustable for altitude and the cap opens nearly a full 180 degrees so you can get the flame close to the work. The Helios is easily and quickly refillable and carries a lifetime mechanical warranty.   Of all the features perhaps the most important to Alaskan hunters in the field is the fact that the Helios TM  Stormproof® lighter can withstand winds of 70 to 80 miles an hour. When the going gets tough, this little lighter will probably get going.   One word of caution when using any butane-fueled device in cold weather. Butane does not work when the temperature drops below freezing. Keep your Helios in an inner pocket or wear it on a neck lanyard inside an outer garment. If you do, the lighter can be used to extremely low temperatures, down to as much as -40 degrees Fahrenheit.   There you have it. Three new pieces of gear that really work for the Alaskan hunter. Now's the time to gear up for a great hunt.   Browning TM  products are available at many local sporting goods dealers in Alaska. SafeWater TM  products can be found in some sporting goods or backpacking type stores. SafeWater TM  can also be reached directly at (970) 247- 3999 or on the web at  www.safewateranywhere.com/ .

GX120-44-1665623	"Hopewell Culture     Administrative History                   CHAPTER EIGHT   Resource Management and Visitor Protection  (continued)       Resource Management Concerns      Following the visitor center's opening in 1960, damaged turf and shrubbery around the building appeared to be caused by burrowing gophers.  Superintendent John C. W. Riddle invited two members of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's rodent and predator control unit based in Columbus to visit and advise on this damaged area as well as similar depredations within the mounds enclosure.  On October 2, 1962, the experts determined that the omnipresent thirteen-lined ground squirrels were the chief culprits for turf damage, while mice were wreaking havoc on the new shrubbery.  Recommended chemical deterrents included calcium cyanide for the ground squirrels and zinc phosphide-treated grain for prairie voles.  The rodent control regimen received Washington Office approval, and the first treatments were applied in November 1962. [ 3 ]    Controlling the orchard mouse or prairie vole proved difficult.  The vegetarian rodents constructed noticeable surface runways through the turf, and frequently availed themselves to tunnels abandoned by ground squirrels.  They particularly were fond of seeds and roots and bark of young trees and shrubs, and used burlap from young plantings to construct nests.  Monument workers applied zinc phosphide to poison feed grain that was then broadcast to the mounds and along edges of unmowed fields at a rate of six to ten pounds per acre.  A January 1963 assessment deemed the poisoning an effective deterrent with reapplication used as conditions warranted.            Figure 71:  Park Guide Frances Spetnagel indicates a display on ground squirrels in the visitor center lobby.   (NPS/early 1960s)        Most methods to control ground squirrels at Mound City Group failed. These included using a twenty-two caliber air gun and pumping in water to flood burrow entrances.  Although the rodents produced only one litter per year, each litter typically varied from five to fourteen young.  If left unchecked, the colony could become very destructive. Application of calcium cyanide using a foot pump duster involved inserting the device into burrow openings and pumping the poison gas into the dens in early spring and late fall, periods of light visitation.  While leaving turf areas unsightly, the rodents constituted a real safety hazard as Riddle explained, ""They become a nuisance in public use areas by burrowing holes and throwing up small mounds of gravel.  This is a hazard to the visitor, as the ground or path that the visitor must walk over to visit the different points of interest become unstabilized and constantly pitted with holes and loose mounds of gravel.  The mounds of loose gravel also create a hazard during the periods that the mound area must be mowed."" [ 4 ]    Superintendent James Coleman made the best of the situation.  An avid golfer, Coleman enjoyed practicing his putting upon the lawn of the superintendent's residence.  Taking advantage of the ground squirrel holes for making put shots, Coleman sometimes was unable to retrieve his golf balls.  After the poison gas regimen was ruled a failure at curbing the ground squirrel population, Coleman authorized purchase of a pellet gun.  Concerned by the safety hazard, particularly to small children who enjoyed, despite NPS restrictions, running through the mound area, the staff declared war on the rodents.  During one week in March 1966, forty-two ground squirrels were killed as they began emerging from hibernation.  Coleman, Maintenance Leader J. Vernon Acton, and Archeologist Lee Hanson took turns using the gun.  Hanson later recalled, ""We... used to take turns shooting them when there were no visitors around.  I thought highly of my marksmanship and did most of the shooting.  I found that the ground squirrels had one flaw in their character which was curiosity.  I took advantage of this and whenever one would dive into its hole, I would draw a bead on the hole and wait for it to stick its head up to see if I was still there.  I got a lot of head shots.  We tried to retrieve the carcasses but once in a while one would go down into its burrow and we couldn't reach it.""  Following a complaint from an irate visitor who viewed one of the poor deceased creatures, the monument put the gun away. [ 5 ]    The thirteen-lined ground squirrel issue, and to a lesser extent groundhog burrowing, remains to be solved.  Permitting native grass to grow tall has changed the habitat and made it less desirable.  Overall numbers of these rodents have decreased.  Resource managers continue to seek alternatives to control or remove this exotic species that has few natural predators.  New forms of poison gas approved by the Washington Office for rodent control were tried in 1991 by depositing gas cartridges into burrow openings. [ 6 ]  Such measures have helped keep the nuisance rodent population under control.    Jon Casson, the monument's integrated pest management (IPM) coordinator, prepared a draft IPM plan in 1990.  Its primary feature included converting existing turf grasses to native grasses, a radical reversal of past management practices.  The plan suggested the same treatment for the Hopeton Earthworks Unit, converting cultivated fields to a mixed native grass species.  While the monument lacked sufficient human and fiscal resources to launch its own IPM program, it did engage in cooperating with the U.S. Forest Service to monitor for gypsy moths in the area.  By 1990, Mound City Group had six traps installed with negative results.  In 1991, it was one of four Midwest parks participating in a regional gypsy moth monitoring program.  Chillicothe results were negative until the summer of 1996, when the first specimen appeared in one of seven traps set at Mound City Group.  Migrating from northern Ohio, the gypsy moth began to infiltrate the Chillicothe area. [ 7 ]    Riverbank erosion became a key issue to be addressed as early as 1977, several years prior to the area of primary erosion being added to the monument.  Thirty-five acres of a 52.7-acre tract on the north boundary suffered intensive erosion.  Over a fifty-year period, the bank had been worn away an estimated foot per year by the Scioto.  The activity threatened to undermine a Hopewell habitation site, and posed an immediate safety hazard to agricultural workers.  Park managers needed immediate studies to determine how best to halt the erosion along the large horseshoe river bend as well as learn how mitigative measures might impact private land across the river.  That landowner, Bill Houser, had long before contacted the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Chillicothe Correctional Institute (CCI) over the federally-built levee that he contended caused accelerated erosion.  Houser's suggestion of a flood channel across CCI land to alleviate potential flooding in north Chillicothe received swift rejection from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but the opinion was not backed up by research.  In early 1983, Ken Apschnikat formally requested the Corps' assistance in developing alternatives for riverbank stabilization. [ 8 ]    Erosion-control engineers arrived for an inspection in late March 1983, and it soon became apparent that offering technical assistance under section 55 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 might be problematic.  Because the legislation lacked language authorizing Corps assistance to another federal agency, the needed assistance had to be postponed for two years in order for the National Park Service to program fiscal resources to reimburse the Corps of Engineers.  [ 9 ]    Riverbank stabilization work resumed in 1985 with up to $25,000 available for a design analysis of stabilization alternatives and cost estimates, but no full-scale plans and specifications.  The Corps' August 1985 study found severe erosion along an eighty-five-foot section of the west bank where piping or surface water leaching off the cultivated field contributed to the accelerated riverbank erosion.  To a much lesser extent, erosion caused by high-water events also claimed slough-off.  The Corps recommended three courses of action with cost estimates all in excess of $100,000.  Because of lack of funds and no visitor use of the area, Superintendent Apschnikat determined to monitor the area every two years and post signs warning people of the dropoff danger.  In 1986, two seasonal engineers from the Midwest Regional Office established two monitoring points.  These were replaced in 1990 with more accurate fixed datum points to assess the rate and degree of erosion pending construction funds to arrest the problem.  [ 10 ]    Under provision of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, federal land managing agencies are required to identify all threatened and endangered plants and animals and their critical habitats.  National Park Service policy also holds that species considered rare or unique to a park unit be identified and their distribution noted on maps.  Federal managers are mandated to protect the species from development or other human-caused harm.  While Clyde King prepared lists of plants and animals as early as 1947, no professional survey for threatened and endangered species had been conducted until Ken Apschnikat submitted a funding request in the early 1980s.  Resource management experts believed any endangered species would likely exist along the relatively undisturbed Scioto River.  In 1987, Apschnikat requested the Natural Areas and Preserves Division of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to help identify threatened and endangered species that might exist at Mound City Group National Monument.  The state findings determined no endangered or rare species within the monument, but four sensitive species known to be in the Chillicothe vicinity.  A request for information to be added to a computerized database in 1991 brought the response of lack of staff and funds to compile information on park species. [ 11 ]    As the small monument grew beyond the immediate Mound City Group in the early 1990s, it became necessary to expand resources management capabilities in Chillicothe.  While still prone to seek expertise at the regional office or closer to home, the park clearly established its need for professional expertise to manage and preserve its increasing number of resources.  This professionalization of the staff included for the first time in a quarter-century the addition of an archeologist.    A scoping session to prepare Hopewell Culture National Historical Park's first resource management plan came in November 1993.  Hosted by Superintendent Neal and park staff, team specialists included, Associate Regional Director James Loach, Regional Museum Specialist Abby Sue Fisher, Regional Chief of Resource Management Steve Cinnamon, Regional Historian Ron Cockrell, Regional Historical Landscape Architect Mary V. Hughes, and Regional Archeologist Mark J. Lynott.  Recognizing the evolving nature of the expanded park, another revision of the key document came in 1995. [ 12 ]    Natural resource management in 1995 saw a comprehensive inventory of plants within the five discontiguous units by the National Biological Survey.  The agency hired Jennifer Course, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, to conduct the effort with assistance from volunteers. The team collected 438 species, and found two state-listed species.

The  Alaska Hunting Bulletin  is a regular publication of the Alaska Department of Fish and Games Division of Wildlife Conservation.     What you will find in the  Bulletin  are the “nuts and bolts of practical wildlife conservation as that relates to hunting.” The  Bulletin  will not normally be covering “where to” or “how to” articles.  That information is well covered by private publishers.   Instead, you will find in this publication information about changes in the hunting regulations, habitat management work, hunter education, wildlife research, results of game surveys, and so forth.     We hope you find the information in this issue useful and interesting.        Reinventing the Permit System © by Bob Robb      Since statehood, sport hunting in Alaska has grown from a relatively simple thing into a sometimes-complex proposition involving licenses, harvest tickets, permit hunts, and different levels of subsistence hunting.  For sport hunters, permit hunts draw a LOT of interest. And as this interest continues to grow, the Department of Fish and Game is working to streamline the permitting process to eliminate confusion and to reduce both the cost and complexity of administering the program.       Permit hunts occur when hunter demand is higher than a game population can sustain. There are two kinds of permits—drawing permits and registration permits. Drawing permits limit the number of hunters who may participate in a given hunt, while registration permits are typically unlimited in number, but the season may be closed when a specified number of animals has been harvested.      “The permit system has grown over the years and has become very complex,” said Suzan Bowen, Regulations Project Coordinator for the Division of Wildlife Conservation in Anchorage. “We're trying to make it more user-friendly for hunters. Our job is to make the program as cost-efficient, smooth running, and fair as possible.”     A task force within ADF&G was created to come up with answers to these problems and has been meeting since October 1997.     “All regions of the state are represented, as well as the Hunter Services coordinator, an area biologist, and one of our public service people.” Bowen said.      The task force is following a process in developing solutions. The first step, she says, is to document how the agency is currently handling permitting. The second step is to decide how it should be handled to better serve the public.      In 1997 the Board of Game adopted a new regulation that complicated the permit process.  Both resident and non-resident hunters had to buy a hunting license and big game harvest tag before they could apply for a permit hunt. However, the Board amended that regulation for the 1998 season, so that only a hunting license must be purchased or ordered by mail before applying for a permit.  It is no longer necessary to purchase the big game tag prior to applying for a permit hunt.       Bowen said the agency also wants to make it easy for a hunter to purchase a license and big game tags.  Future plans include automating license sales—allowing people to purchase their hunting license over the telephone using a credit card.       “We hope for that system to be in place by 1999. We are also exploring the idea of putting the drawing permit system on the Internet, so people could apply for permits and purchase licenses over the 'net using a credit card.”     Bowen stressed that the hunting public will have ample opportunity to comment on how to make the permit system better.       “First we are looking at how to improve the internal process of issuing permits,” she said. “We will soon be asking hunters how we can make the system better from their point of view. The task force has made few changes for the1998 season.”      “We plan to have the new program in place by the year 2000, but hunters will see major changes beginning in 1999.”      The Black List      Many hunters are not aware of what ADF&G calls the “Black List.”  But if you're on it, you may not be allowed to apply for a permit hunt for that year.  The good news is that it is easy to stay off the black list—you simply have to return your permit report.         According to state hunting regulations, hunters are required to turn in the report portion of a permit within a few days after the season closes for most hunts.  However, for some registration permit hunts, the time period for returning the permit report is shorter.       Bowen says this is because the seasons for some registration hunts are closed when a set harvest level is reached and permit reports are used to determine the harvest level.  For example, on some Kodiak brown bear hunts ADF&G wants your report two days after you leave the field, even if you don't kill an animal. On other hunts, it may be five days, or 15, or 30.  These dates are determined by area biologists, who closely monitor the harvest as it occurs to avoid excessive take.   Hunters need to pay attention to the requirements of each individual hunt.      “If you fail to return your permit report on time you may be put on the black list, or fined,” Bowen said.  “If you're on the black list, you would not be able to participate in any drawing permit hunts the next year.”      This stiff penalty is in place to force hunters to report to area biologists in a timely fashion, Bowen said. The reason is simple. ""These are restricted hunts because the number of hunters who want to participate is higher than the game population can sustain.""      “Obviously, ADF&G has to keep a close eye on the affected game population,” she said.  That makes the harvest information extremely important in terms of future management of that game population.      The black list is a one-year disqualification. It does not disqualify a person from participating in the general hunting season, only from permit hunts.   Avoiding the black list is easy, game managers say: just turn in those permit reports on time.      Bob Robb is a free-lance writer and hunter.  He lives in Valdez.    Top of Document           Nelchina Caribou: What Next?   © by Les Palmer      While the Tier I hunt ended earlier than expected, many Alaska hunters were able to bring in a caribou for winter table fare. Photo by Matt Snyder. For the second season in a row, the 1997-98 Nelchina caribou hunt ended with a lot of hunters going home disappointed.      A decade ago, Nelchina caribou hunters hunted with drawing permits and hunter participation and success were both high.  This year, harvest was high in comparison with many past years, but hunter success was low. The 24,000 holders of Tier I and Tier II subsistence permits took only 3,500 caribou (2,400 bulls and 1,100 cows). It was pretty much a repeat of the previous season, when 37,000 permits were issued and only 5,000 caribou were taken. Many hunters were left wondering what had happened.     The Aug. 1 - Sept. 20 season looked grim before it began. Summer droughts apparently caused the herd to move from the Talkeetna Mountains to lower areas, where the grass looked greener. Instead of bunching up, the herd dispersed into a broad band stretching from the Fog Lakes, in the upper Susitna River Basin, eastward along the Alphabet Hills toward Paxson. Unfortunately for hunters, much of that area is swampy and miles from roads and trails.     What's more, the herd numbered fewer than the 45,000 animals that biologists had predicted early last year. When they counted again in June, after calving, they found only 35,000.     Many hunters wondered what had happened to the 10,000 “missing” caribou. Part of the 10,000 was probably due to error, said Bob Tobey, area wildlife biologist for the Department of Fish and Game in Glennallen.     “When you're counting 30-some-thousand animals, an error of 10 percent is within acceptable limits of any affordable field operation,” Tobey said.     Most of the remainder of the 10,000 was that fewer calves were born than were predicted.     “We determined at least half of that 10,000 was lower calf production,” Tobey said. “When you go from a production of 55 calves per 100 cows down to the lower 40s, that's a 5,000 to 6,000 drop in calves.”     Why the drop? There is good evidence that poor nutrition on the summer range is causing problems, Tobey said.     “Calves from the Nelchina herd don't weigh as much as calves from most other Interior herds,” Tobey said. “We feel the smaller size is some indication of range stress.”      Tobey points out that nutritionally stressed caribou also often skip pregnancy the next year.  Either they don't conceive or they don't carry the calf to term.  “Pretty much the same thing happened after the cold summer of 1993.”      Four years ago, biologists began a study to determine “age at first reproduction.” With the aid of radio-collars, they're now finding that the Nelchina herd's cows aren't producing calves until age three.     “By comparison, when a herd is on real good range, probably about half the two-year-olds would have calves,” Tobey said. “None of our two-year-olds had calves, and only half of our three-year-olds had calves.”      Wildlife staff believe wolf predation is also up, based on their field observations and a higher than usual mortality rate among radio-collared caribou, Tobey said.  That can also have a strong effect on calf survival.     Last fall, after adjusting for summertime calf mortality, biologists reduced the Nelchina herd population estimate to 32,000, which is below the management objective of 35,000 to 40,000 caribou.     When the season began on August 1, department biologists were closely monitoring the herd's movements. With 24,000 permits out and only 32,000 caribou, they had to be ready to stop the hunt to avoid overharvest.       “We reduced the allowable harvest figures based on what we observed in herd production.” Tobey said. “Herd swings are pretty much normal for caribou, and we always have to be ready to change our plans quickly.”     Most hunters never did see the herd in large numbers. Nonetheless, the department's Glennallen office kept busy. With so many hunters looking for the herd in vain, one person was kept busy just answering telephone calls, Tobey said. The recorded-message phone that gives in-season herd information was also in constant use, he said.  [The Glennallen office provides up-to-date hunting information during the season on a telephone recording in Anchorage – (907) 267-2304  -Ed.]     As in 1996, the herd remained dispersed and inaccessible to most hunters. However, the harvest was large enough that on Sept. 20, the department closed the Oct. 21 - Mar. 31 winter hunt to all but the 10,000 holders of Tier II permits. As things turned out, that decision made little difference to the 14,000 Tier I hunters. In October and November, the herd moved eastward to Tok, Northway and into Canada—another repeat of 1996 behavior. Again, the herd was inaccessible to most hunters.     What's the plan for the coming season?     “There's no question we didn't have the calf production,” Tobey said.  “At some point we have to cut back on the harvest to make up for this poor cohort coming in.”     The department decided to cut back sooner rather than later, Tobey said. Only Tier II permits will be issued for Unit 13 in 1998, and how many won't be known until after the June herd counts.     “We told hunters Tier I was just a one- or two-year thing, and not to expect it to be an annual event,” Tobey said. “It was intended to reduce the herd. It's just unfortunate that the herd declined in productivity and that hunters didn't get the benefit of more caribou.”       One “social” type problem that Tobey saw with this year's hunt was that some hunters left gut piles right next to the road and parking areas.     “A few hunters came into the area, shot a caribou, brought it out to the road and left the gut pile almost on the blacktop,” Tobey said.  “Most travelers don't like seeing that.  It's not that they're anti-hunters necessarily.  Most are just non-hunters, and we don't want them to turn into anti-hunters because of some poor hunting practices.”     THE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE © by Les Palmer      “The management objective” may sound like a Robert Ludlum novel, but it's nowhere near that exciting. Unless you're a biologist, that is.     Department of Fish and Game biologists have estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 caribou is the number the Nelchina herd's range can carry without damage from overgrazing.  This is the management objective biologists attempt to attain and sustain.     The number wasn't plucked from the air, but is the product of years of field research in range health, calf production and other factors. Although nature may have done more in the last two years to reduce the herd's size than hunters, the department remains “pretty comfortable” with the current objective, said area biologist Bob Tobey.     “We increased the management objective above 35,000 when our studies showed the range improved in the late 1970s and early 1980s,” Tobey said. “Then, when the herd got higher than 40,000 we started seeing a range condition decline.”     Tobey says overall range condition today is visibly poorer, an observation borne out by the permanent range survey sites the agency has established.  These sites show a distinct decline in lichen abundance, a caribou forage mainstay.     “With that kind of range decline, we had to reduce herd size in order to maintain the population,” he said. “Caribou herds tend to cycle high and low, and the lows can sometimes remain low for a long time.  We're trying to avoid those lows.”     Whether the present management objective will accomplish that, only time will tell. Managing large herds of animals that wander over vast areas of roadless wilderness will likely always remain part science and part art.      HUNTING AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL © by Les Palmer      “Game management” is something of a misnomer, since game managers have little control over game. They do, however, have at least some control over hunters. By regulating seasons, bag limits, antler size, methods and means, and so forth, managers can meet harvest objectives.     Trouble is, legal constraints sometimes limit management options. And hunters don't always do what managers think they'll do.     Until 1990, if you wanted to hunt Nelchina caribou in GMU 13, you threw your name in with as many as 16,000 other applicants to win one of 1,800 drawing permits in a lottery. If you won, you went hunting, and you hunted hard. In those days, up to 70 percent of drawing permit holders took home caribou.     After a 1989 decision by the Alaska Supreme Court (McDowell v. State of Alaska), all Alaskans became subsistence users, where before it had been only the 20 percent living in “rural” areas.  To provide for times when game was insufficient for subsistence needs, the Board of Game set up a “tiered” system for allocating game among subsistence users.  To obtain a Tier II subsistence permit, applicants have to answer questions about their customary and direct dependence, and the availability of alternate foods.  Applicants scoring highest win the permits, with a limit of three per family.     For whatever reason, when the Nelchina hunt went to Tier II, the hunter success rate began dropping, from about 70 percent to about 50 percent.  At the same time, the percentage of bulls in the harvest increased from about 50 percent to about 75 percent.     In 1996, when the herd numbered 50,000—10,000 more than the management objective—biologists knew that to reduce and stabilize the population, they needed to harvest more cows.  Because of the state's subsistence laws, a Tier I hunt was the only available option.  In this case, permitees were only allowed to harvest cows. To minimize problems with young bulls being mistaken for cows, Tier I hunters were allowed to take a young bull instead of a cow, providing it had 6 or fewer tines on one antler. Tier II hunters were given the choice of taking a bull under the Tier II permit or a cow or young bull under a Tier I permit.     Although natural factors including weather and predation apparently helped reduce the size of the herd during the past two years, the Tier I hunt showed promise as a management tool. During the 1996-97 season, 50 percent of the harvest of 5,000 caribou in Unit 13 were cows, most of which were taken by Tier I hunters. If Tier I hunting had continued into the winter of 1997-98, a similar cow-bull harvest composition would have likely resulted, instead of the 1,100 cows and 2,400 bulls that were taken in that harvest.     If—or more likely when—the Nelchina herd again surpasses the management objective of 40,000, biologists say hunting cows will probably again be necessary.  This should avoid herd growth to a size that could spell long term damage to its range.      COUNTING CARIBOU © by Les Palmer      Caribou, constantly in motion, are not the easiest animals to count.  While modern radio-tagging and photographic equipment has come to the aid of biologists, much hard work remains.  Area biologist Bob Tobey, of the Department of Fish and Game's Glennallen office, explains how the Nelchina herd is counted.     “In the spring, about a month after calving, we count the caribou when they come together in a post-calving group.  This is the time when caribou are most aggregated.  The bulls are the missing ingredient in these big groups, because they are spread out in smaller groups in the mountains.”     “If the groups are tightly grouped we take aerial photos with a special survey camera.  Smaller groups that are more spread out we count from other small aircraft.  We count the caribou in the aerial photos and add in the caribou we count in the smaller groups.”     “Immediately after we count in the spring, we go back out in a helicopter to get herd composition.  We need to know the percentage of bulls, cows and calves in the herd.  Then, during the rut, we go back out and look at herd composition again.  This is when we pick up the bulls that weren't in the spring groups.  This second 'comp' count also tells us how the calves fared during the summer.”     “The final herd estimate is a combination of a direct count and an extrapolation of animals that didn't get counted, but that we know are there based on changes in the 'comp' counts.  This is why we do 'comp' counts twice a year.”     “We're tracking trends. We don't know the exact number. But we know that whatever number we get, it's probably a minimum. You usually don't count them all.”     “Our current caribou counting techniques have evolved quite a bit in the last few decades.  The counts aren't perfect, but that's pretty typical of wildlife surveys anywhere.  The question we have to ask is this 'is the system good enough to allow us to meet management objectives.'  At this point, I'd have to say it is working.”      Author Les Palmer is a free lance writer and hunter education instructor.  He lives in Sterling.      Top of Document           Game Board Drops Big Game Tag Pre-Purchase Requirement for Drawing Permit Applications      Faced with a declining number of applications, increasing confusion and a revenue loss estimated at $120,000 last year, the Alaska Board of Game has rescinded the requirement that drawing permit applicants purchase the necessary big game tags prior to or at the time of applying.     The board, however, did leave in place the requirement that drawing permit applicants purchase a hunting license prior to application.       At its February meeting, the board heard a report from the Division of Wildlife Conservation on the effects of the tag fee requirement, which was adopted by the board in 1995 but only went into effect in the spring of 1997.     Even though slightly more permits were available than the year before, the number of applicants decreased by 4,389 (17 percent). The decline was most dramatic among nonresidents intending to hunt with next of kin for species for which a guide normally would be required. That segment of applicants declined 73 percent. The number of general nonresidents applying dropped 40 percent and the number of resident applicants was down 15 percent.     Those who did apply had trouble completing the forms accurately. The initial error rate was more than 20 percent. Actions taken by DWC, including telephone contact with some hunters, trimmed the error rate to slightly more than 6 percent, but that still was nearly double the rate in any of the four previous years.     The single two-sided sheet previously used to apply for drawing permits was replaced by four double-sided pages to explain the new requirements and obtain the necessary information from those who wished to purchase tags and licenses with their applications.     DWC estimated it spent $178,700 to start-up the new license and tag fee system, most of it on computer system analysis and software development to process applications. Recurring administrative costs were estimated at $24,300 per year.     Based on averages for the previous four years, the loss of nonresident application and tag fees was projected at $127,130 a year. That was offset somewhat by increased license sales.     One of the reasons the board adopted the tag fee requirement was to ensure that participants in Alaska's most intensively managed hunts were contributing a fair proportion of those management costs. But the large number of nonresident dropouts indicated their unwillingness to do so.     Another reason that motivated the board to adopt the tag fee requirement was to discourage frivolous applicants from decreasing the opportunities for serious hunters to obtain permits. The tag fee requirement did accomplish that goal. The number of permits won by Alaska hunters increased almost 3 percent to 97.2 percent. And the percentage of successful applicants jumped from 4.8 to 6.4 percent.     The increase was most dramatic for brown bear permits where the success rate jumped 4.75 percent to 12.25 percent. Interestingly, the success rates for two of the most coveted species, bison and sheep, increased by less than 1 percent.     Applications for drawing permits for the 1998-99 season became available May 1 and must be returned by mail no later than May 31.     Top of Document           TEAMING WITH WILDLIFE: A Status Report      Alaska continues to lead the way in building grassroots support for the Teaming With Wildlife (TWW) proposal. Already 460 prominent individuals, organizations and government entities have signed on as sponsors in Alaska and the number is growing daily. The next closest state in terms of sponsors is Iowa with slightly more than 200. There are more than 2,800 sponsors nationwide.     This spring, Ken Taylor, deputy director of the Division of Wildlife Conservation, and Carl Rosier, former ADF&G Commissioner representing the Territorial Sportsmen, traveled to Washington, D.C. to promote TWW.  “The future of hunting in the United States depends upon two things,” Taylor said.  “Public acceptance of hunters as safe, responsible and ethical in their pursuit of game, and a strong, well-funded education program in the schools that presents a balanced wildlife conservation education curriculum.  Funding from the Teaming initiative will help accomplish this.  Without it, groups such as the Humane Society, Fund for Animals, and PETA will fill the void with their curricula to schools across the country.”     TWW would institute a system where other wildlife users help hunters and fishermen pay the cost of wildlife management and conservation through a tax on outdoor equipment. TWW would be similar to the tremendously successful Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson federal aid programs that have contributed billions of dollars to fish and wildlife conservation and restoration.  In addition to education, TWW would fund trail construction and maintenance in state parks, nongame/endangered species research, and watchable wildlife programs such as occur at McNeil River and Round Island State Sanctuaries.      The TWW proposal may be introduced during this session of   Congress, and the emphasis has turned to contacting and educating   members of key congressional committees. The biggest key appears   to be Alaska's own Don Young. By virtue of his seniority, his   chairmanship of the House Resources Committee, and his leadership   position on the Congressional Sportsman's Caucus, many in the   majority are waiting to see where Young comes down on the issue.   If Young agrees to work this legislation through the House   Resources Committee this year, Senator Stevens may help it   through the Appropriations Committee on the Senate side.         Top of Document           Hunters Take First Elk in Southeast Alaska      Just ten years after fifty Oregon elk were released on an island south of Wrangell, hunters have taken the first elk from the population.       Thirty-three Roosevelt elk and 17 Rocky Mountain elk were released on Etolin Island in 1987.  After a shaky start, the elk population increased and dispersed, and last year biologists estimated 250 animals in the spring population.  The elk have established a breeding population on Zarembo Island and observers have reported elk on several surrounding islands as well.     The Board of Game established the first bull elk hunting season in Unit 3 for October 1 through October 31, 1997. Twenty-seven drawing permits were selected from 1,375 applicants. The State Legislature passed a bill allowing the Department of Fish and Game to donate up to four additional elk harvest permits to nonprofit corporations. Two of these were issued and were raffled off for the 1997 season, benefiting both the nonprofits and state wildlife conservation programs.     At the end of the season, ADF&G staff counted 8 bulls in the harvest—seven from Etolin Island and one from Zarembo. Three of the bulls were large trophy bulls; two had 6 X 6 antler points and one had 7 X 8 points.     Most of the hunters used boats to hunt the beach on the southwest side of Etolin Island.  One successful hunter flew into an alpine lake on the island. The successful hunter on Zarembo shot his bull from the road system.     As usual, October weather was variable. The first week was clear and warm.  This caused the elk to move away from the beach to higher elevations. The next two weeks brought cooler temperaturs and rain. The last week of the season was wet with high winds out of the southeast. Clarence Strait had small craft warnings the entire week making access difficult.     ADF&G plans to issue 30 drawing permits for the second fall 1998 SE Alaska elk season. Applications and newspaper supplements explaining the hunt will be available from license vendors May 1. Applications must be postmarked by May 31.     Top of Document           The Search for Caribou Co-management     [Editors Note: John Trent is Rural Issues Coordinator for the Division of Wildlife Conservation.  In the August, 1997 issue of the Alaska Hunting Bulletin, he described recent experiences in the north with comanagement, a kind of shared decision making that developed in the 1980's.  In this issue, John explains ongoing efforts in Alaska to explore the possibility of comanaging the Western Arctic Caribou Herd.]         At the Board of Game    It is October 27, 1997, the Alaska Board of Game is convened at Nome and Pete Schaeffer,  Inupiaq hunter and regional leader from Kotzebue, is concluding his remarks to the Board:     “In fact, we have been waiting since Statehood and prior to be asked to  participate.  We wait patiently, instructed by our Elders to do so until we sit in  our rightful place on the management table.  Caribou is a good place to start,  since we Inupiaq in Northwest Alaska, among other tribes, are the People of the  Caribou.  We cannot allow an opportunity such as this comanagement project  to fall by the wayside.  We all cannot afford to.  Thank you.”        The Board responded with a resolution (97-115-BOG) encouraging the use of comanagement teams as, “a positive and beneficial supplement to the Board's regulatory process.”  The Board also assigned two members to work with a group examining comanagement of the Western Arctic Caribou Herd.      Looking for a Better Way to Manage      Comanagement of the herd emerged as a promising concept in the spring of 1995, during a meeting about improving harvest reporting in the north.  In the winter of 1995-96, University of Alaska Professor Jack Kruse and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game held scoping meetings in Anchorage Fairbanks, Barrow, Kotzebue, Nome and Huslia.  The question asked was, “Does comanagement make sense for the Western Arctic Caribou Herd?”       Simultaneously, Maniilaq Association (Kotzebue), represented by Art Ivanoff, held a series of meetings in villages in northwestern Alaska to gauge support and share information on the Western Arctic Herd.     In the ADF&G scoping process, responses varied with geography.  For the hunters, trappers and advisory committee members in Huslia, there was no question—comanagement was worth trying.  Leaders in Nome and Kotzebue were also interested.  “But it has to be true comanagement,” one leader from Nome warned, “a true sharing of responsibility between the managers and the people.”       At Barrow responses were mixed.  Elsewhere, members of the Fairbanks and Anchorage Advisory Committees expressed concerns that comanagement might cost urban hunters opportunities to hunt Western Arctic caribou.  The Fairbanks committee agreed to provide a representative to work on the comanagement concept.  Representatives of environmental organizations and federal managers also had some concerns about comanaging this herd.                   In April 1996, the Maniilaq Association organized a meeting called  “Comanagement, an Opportunity to Work Together.”   Following that meeting, a comanagement agreement was drafted by some of the federally recognized tribes and regional Alaska Native organizations like NANA, Maniilaq, Kawerak, and Tanana Chiefs.  People in these organizations were ready to make caribou comanagement a reality.     At that point few people in Alaska knew about the tribes' draft comanagement agreement.  Workers in the resource agencies felt that more public discussion was needed.  Some also wanted to more fully understand the legal implications of comanagement.   ADF&G staff  were not opposed to comanagement, but felt that the discussion process needed to be expanded.  “We believe the time is ripe to consider comanagement for selected resources,” said John Coady, a senior ADF&G biologist speaking to the Alaska Bar Association in March, 1997.     Since then, a Western Arctic Caribou Working Group has organized to include as many interest groups as possible. The working group is developing a public involvement plan and will begin discussing the Maniilaq draft comanagement agreement as well as other ideas for improving public participation.  The working group will then make recommendations for change to decision makers like the Alaska Board of Game.     How would caribou comanagement be different?      If we follow many other examples already established in Canada and Alaska,  the comanagement centerpiece  would be a group of individuals dedicated solely to the welfare of the Western Arctic Herd and the all people who use that herd.  The people in this group would work together to identify and resolve problems concerning Western Arctic caribou.  The group would meet regularly, including in the smaller communities within the range of the herd.  Cross-cultural communication would be emphasized and decisions would largely be by consensus. The thorny issue of representation would have to be resolved to include all the main interests in this herd.       If created, a comanagement group would not be a regulations-making body.  Instead it would provide recommendations for regulatory action to the Board of Game and the Federal Subsistence Board.  Experience elsewhere suggests that comanagement groups are very successful in influencing the outcome of regulations as well as policies, research and management activities.     It's a Public Decision      The Western Arctic Caribou Herd is an enormous public asset.  It is a resource currently in excellent condition.  The 1996 census results have just been published—463,000 animals were counted in that year.  This represents approximately half of all the caribou in Alaska and is by far the largest caribou herd in the U.S.  For Alaska Native people, the search for comanagement represents a deep-seated desire to participate more fully in management of a resource crucial to their cultures.  For wildlife biologists, comanagement is an opportunity to improve upon the limitations of existing management systems.  Will Alaskans approve this change in management style?  Only time and discussion will tell.  And that is the way it should be.     Top of Document           1998-99 Hunting Regulations — What's New?      The Alaska Board of Game meets at least twice each year to revise the state's hunting regulations and keep them up to date with changes in wildlife populations, hunting trends and other factors.  This list shows some important changes that hunters can expect for the 1998/99 season.   This list should be viewed as a general guide only.  The regulations booklets will be available in early July.     Brown Bear      Changed resident bag limit to one bear per year in Units 19D and 25D, and eliminated resident tag requirement. Required in-unit sealing, and the bag limit does count against other areas of the state where the brown bear bag limit is one bear every four years.   Expanded all brown bear seasons in Unit 22 (except 22C) to include the entire winter season and extended the season to May 31.   Reduced resident season in Unit 26B from Aug. 20 to Sept. 1. Eliminated nonresident general season in Unit 26B and established drawing permit hunt from Sept. 1-May 20.      Caribou      Added a portion of Unit 12 to the registration hunt in southern Unit 20D.   Changed caribou drawing hunts in Unit 20B, 20F, and 25C (White Mts.) to registration hunts.      Moose      Closed the antlerless moose drawing hunts in Unit 14A, most nonmilitary lands of 14C and 15A to nonresidents.   Added 5 days to the beginning of the spike-fork season in Units 12 and 20E.   Established Aug. 15-28 spike-fork moose hunt, and Jan. 1-Feb. 15 any bull hunt in Healy River drainage of Unit 20D.   Eliminated the registration moose hunts in the Unit 21B Nowitna drainage and established general seasons.      Muskoxen      Established a combination of Tier I and drawing permit hunts on the east side of the Dalton Highway in Unit 26B and restricted the Tier II hunt to the west side of the Dalton Highway.       Sheep      In Units 23 and 26A, sheep hunt areas were redefined, fall drawing permit hunts were established in portions of the units, and winter registration hunts were extended to begin Aug. 10 instead of Oct. 1. See page 96 and page 107 of the regulations book.      Miscellaneous      Simplified the license requirement for drawing permit applications.   Amended the meat-on-the bone restriction in Units 9B, 17, portions of 19A within the Holitna/Hoholitna Controlled Use Area, and 19B, to apply only prior to Oct. 1, and eliminate the ribs from the requirement. Also added Unit 21A to the area where meat-on-the-bone is required.   Required waterfowl hunters to register in the migratory bird harvest information program    Relaxed airboat restrictions in Nenana Controlled Use Area to allow hunting in the main channels of the Teklanika, Toklat, and Nenana Rivers.   Clarified that placing or leaving any active trap or snare set on land within 1/4 mile of a moose, caribou, or deer taken by the use of a trap or snare is illegal.   Redefined Wood River Controlled Use Area to remove northwest portion and add to the Ferry Trail Management area.      Top of Document           Southeast Alaska's Wolves: Threatened? by Doug Larsen Ketchikan Area Biologist      In 1993, the Colorado-based Biodiversity Legal Foundation submitted a petition to the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS or Service) asking the Service to list Southeast Alaska's wolf population as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  The petitioners argued that loss of habitat from clearcut logging, along with increased road access in parts of Southeast, had made the subspecies vulnerable to population declines which could best be addressed by placing it in threatened status.     Although the USFWS identified a number of concerns about the status of Southeast Alaska wolves, they did not at the time believe listing these wolves as “threatened” was warranted.  The Alaska Board of Game (Board) met during fall 1996 and expressed concerns about the potential listing.  The Board further expressed concerns about the long-term well being of Southeast wolves, particularly those inhabiting Prince of Wales Island (Game Management Unit 2) in southern Southeast Alaska where logging and roading was most extensive.     To safeguard against over harvesting of wolves, the Board requested that ADF&G staff annually estimate wolf numbers in Unit 2 and then set harvest limits at 25% of those estimates.  Additionally, the Board shortened the Unit 2 wolf hunting and trapping season from 172 days to 121 days, required that wolves from the unit be sealed within 30 days of the date of take, and required hunters and trappers to retain leg bones with their wolf pelts.  Leg bones were requested by ADF&G biologists because the age class of wolves can be determined from them.  These data are useful in better evaluating and understanding harvests.     The US Forest Service implemented additional safeguards through revisions of their Tongass Land Management Plan.  A key revision to the plan was the establishment of a network of old-growth forest reserves to ensure for the conservation of critical wildlife habitat.  This action is expected to substantially increase the likelihood of maintaining viable and well-distributed wolf populations throughout Southeast Alaska.     Wolf harvests from Southeast Alaska have ranged from about 175 to 250 annually during the past six seasons.  In Unit 2, where the bulk of the region's harvests occur, over 100 wolves have been harvested during several of the past six seasons, including a high of 134 during the 1996-97 season. The harvest of 80 wolves from the unit during the 1997-98 season appears to be within the pre-season quota of up to 90 wolves.     Given the interest and concern about Southeast Alaska wolves, ADF&G hired a full-time wolf research biologist who will be stationed in Ketchikan.  The researcher, Dave Person, who recently completed a four-year doctoral wolf research project on Prince of Wales Island, is very familiar with the area and with local wolf populations.  In his follow-up research, Dave will focus on wolf/deer relationships and ecology in a portion of Unit 2.  He will also work on developing practical and efficient techniques for estimating numbers of wolves inhabiting Southeast Alaska.     In the meantime, the December - March hunting and trapping season will remain in effect for Unit 2, and the November - April season will remain in effect throughout the remainder of Southeast Alaska.  Biologists will examine leg bones collected during the season from hunters and trappers in order to determine the proportion of pups and adults harvested during the 1997-98 season.  This information will be compared with future age structure data as a way of detecting possible changes in wolf populations.     Today, Southeast Alaska's wolf populations appear to be stable at relatively high levels. Although there continues to be some concern about the long-term welfare of wolves in areas where habitat loss and forest fragmentation have occurred, we are unaware of any current efforts to list the subspecies as either threatened or endangered.  We believe recent Board of Game actions and Forest Service land management planning actions should take care of many of the short-term concerns for Southeast wolves. ADF&G and federal agencies will continue to monitor longer-term impacts from habitat loss into the future.     Top of Document           Becoming an Outdoors-Woman  Weekend © 1998 by Diane Wirth      Dear Gwen,     You asked me about the Becoming an Outdoors-Woman weekend.  It was great!  Yes, even your mother who has lived in Alaska for over 30 years – including the years in Galena – can learn new things about the outdoors in Alaska.       I have to admit that I wasn't sure what the women would be like.  They included every age from the twenties to the sixties, personalities from boisterous to quiet, every body build and conditioning, some experienced and others new to Alaska.  All of them wanted to learn more about the Alaska Outdoors and were real nice.     The instructors included well-known names and behind-the-scenes personnel from Alaska Department of Fish & Game, the Forest Service, Alaska Marine Safety Education Association and the public.  The knowledgeable instructors explained things clearly without condescending.  They encouraged us to get our hands on the subjects.  They all showed great patience and tolerance with our beginner's attempts, like when I backed the boat trailer over the curb three times in a row.  I sure used the whole empty parking lot during the boating safety class.  Sure, I can drive a boat on the water, but Dad always trailers it.  I should know how to do it if he got sick.  Trailering is like learning to drive, your spouse shouldn't teach you.     The instructors also stayed cheerful, even when our Southeast rain tried to drown the fires during the Dutch Oven Cooking class.  I wish you could have tasted the cakes and pastries we made.  And the venison roast melted in our mouths. It all tasted so good!  The rain added the right ambiance to the survival class when we built a shelter using leaves and sticks.     We had great sponsors, too.  National, State and local organizations and businesses donated T-shirts, mugs and wonderful door prizes at the end of the weekend.  My number was drawn for two prizes!  I've never had my number drawn before – you know how many times I've put in for a buffalo permit.  All the women and instructors came away winners from this weekend with new knowledge and friends.           On Sunday I didn't want it to end.  Yes, I wanted to go home to your Dad, but I didn't want to loose contact with women who were interested in doing things I like to do.  Now that my best hunting partner – you – lives out of state, I need other companions.  So I set out a sheet of paper for them to write their names, addresses and phone numbers.  I also drew some columns so they could check off their interests in boating, fishing, hiking and/or hunting and whether they were interested in going out weekends, weekdays or longer.  Later I sent a copy of the list to each woman.  Nineteen wrote down their names.       Since then our “Buddy List” has grown to 47.  Now when one of us wants to take a hike or go fishing we can find someone to go with.  We're talking about forming a club.  I'm going to make sure it always encourages the safe and careful use of Alaska's wild creatures and places.  This weekend some of us will hike to a cabin.  One of the women might go on my hike-in hunt for a Dall ram up north in August.     I hope the Department of Fish & Game puts on another BOW workshop soon.  Next time I'll take kayaking, shotgun and bowhunting, but then I sure do need to learn more ways to cook fish.  I hope they have classes on using a GPS and making jerky from game meat.  So many things to learn....  You have to get the people in Washington State to start a Becoming an Outdoors Woman Program, too.  You and Jill will enjoy it.

Photo by Barry Whitehill, AVHEIA. Alaska had the unwelcome distinction of having the highest hunting fatality rate of any state in the United States in 1997.     During 1997 at least five hunters died as a result of firearms accidents, according to John Matthews, ADF&G hunter education coordinator.  Nationally, there were just 99 firearms-related hunting fatalities in 1997 among 14 million hunters.  With five fatalities among just 93,000 licensed hunters,  Alaska had an accident rate nearly eight times the national average.        In comparison, Matthews points out, Colorado had only two fatalities among more than 577,000 hunters, Montana averaged one fatality per year among over 150,000 hunters and Pennsylvania suffered a single casualty among over 1 million hunters in 1997.  Had the other 49 states experienced Alaska's fatality rate, 761 hunters would have died in firearms accidents in 1997.      Matthews suggests these chilling statistics show little change in a trend that has continued since Alaska statistics were first systematically recorded.  In a 1982 “Firearms Casualty Report” covering the years 1970-1981, state safety officers reported that one of every 5,200 Alaska hunters was involved in an accidental shooting and that almost one-fourth of all firearms accidents in Alaska occurred while hunting.  Over 14 firearms-related hunting accidents per year were reported during this period and the report authors stated, “Alaska has a very high firearms accident rate compared to other states.”  The report concluded that only two of Alaska's certified hunter education graduates had been involved in firearms accidents during the 10-year period.        Tracking Alaska's hunting accidents is difficult because the Department of Public Safety does not keep detailed records of firearms-related hunting accidents.  Alaska is the only state that does not keep such detailed records.  Despite the lack of official records, hunter education instructors, individual state troopers and wildlife protection officers have continued to assemble records of hunting accident trends.         According to hunter educators, Alaska could remain the most dangerous state for hunters simply because it is the only state that does not have comprehensive hunter education requirements. Hunting accident research shows that virtually every accident is preventable if hunters practice and abide by a few basic rules of firearm safety.  In states where hunter education is required, accident rates have declined as much as 75% since pre-hunter education days.  The clear correlation between mandatory hunter safety and the decline in firearms-related hunting fatalities shows the effectiveness of hunter education, Matthews says.       Concern for the safety of both hunters and non-hunters afield triggered a 1997 request to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from Alaska's volunteer hunter education instructors.  Many of Alaska's 300 volunteer hunter education instructors urged the Department to address the need for statewide hunter education requirements.       ADF&G hosted a statewide meeting of over 120 hunter education instructors in February 1997.  The instructors recommended the Division develop a new five-year plan.  They wanted to address three priorities: 1) implementing universal and incentive-based hunter education programs; 2) developing an Alaska-specific hunter education curriculum, and 3) addressing Native Alaskan concerns about presenting hunter education in rural communities.      As a result of the meeting, Director of Wildlife Conservation Wayne Regelin appointed a hunter education steering group the following month. The steering group's charge was to assist the Division in establishing a five-year plan for hunter education.  This new five-year plan will become effective beginning July 1, 1998.   The eight-member steering group includes hunter education instructors Mel Hein of Palmer, Del Demeritt of Fairbanks, Sarah Jones of Soldotna, and Ted Schenck of Sitka.  The steering group also includes Dan Kittoe of Anchorage, a registered guide and volunteer instructor; Eddie Grasser of Palmer, representing the Alaska Outdoor Council; David Cline, representing the Alaska environmental-conservation community; and Orville Lind of King Salmon, representing the rural Native community.

The group examined national and Alaska statistics regarding hunting accidents, hunter behavior in the field, other states' hunter education programs, and public perceptions of hunting and hunters.  By September 1997, a comprehensive draft proposal had been crafted.  Each member of the steering group took the draft plan to other groups for feedback on the proposal.       As a result of the feedback, the draft proposal was fine-tuned over the next three months.  In January the steering group gave unanimous approval to the final draft.  A few weeks later, the steering group presented the final draft to over 110 instructors at ADF&Gs annual instructor's conference and workshop.  After receiving additional feedback from the instructors, the plan was accepted by acclamation and presented to Director Wayne Regelin.  Actual implementation will depend on public discussion and approval by the Alaska Board of Game.  The Board of Game will have to approve or modify portions of this plan for implementation.     The steering group's final comprehensive draft plan directly addresses Alaska's high hunting accident rate.  Incorporating successful ideas from other state programs and adding some uniquely Alaskan ideas resulted in a draft plan designed to reduce Alaska's hunting accidents, sharpen Alaska hunters' skills in the field, address excessive game and waterfowl wounding losses, and increase the number of ethical and responsible hunters in the field.     Hunter Education Proposal Highlights      Note that this is still very much a proposal and whatever changes eventually come about will be as a result of public discussion and action by the Alaska Board of Game.  The proposal is designed to dramatically reduce firearms fatalities in Alaska by training hunters to be safe, responsible, and ethical when afield.      If approved by the Board, Alaska or other valid US or Canada Hunter Education cards would be required beginning July 1, 2000 as follows:   For anyone born after July 1, 1970   Initially in certain Alaska GMUs only   In additional GMUs beginning 2001   Statewide beginning July 1, 2003      Incentives would be offered to encourage maintaining or sharpening hunting skills:   Hunters completing two advanced clinics over a three-year period would be eligible for improved odds in drawing hunts   Hunters could work and study toward recognition and additional hunting privilege as a “master hunter.”      The proposed plan would take effect on July 1, 2000 in key Game Management Units to be designated by the Alaska Board of Game.  Anyone hunting in those GMU's born after July 1, 1970 would be required to possess a hunter education card.  Hunters who already possess an Alaska hunter education card or a valid hunter education card from another state would not have to retake the basic hunter education class.  Surveys conducted by the Department of Fish and Game indicate that more than 40% of Alaska residents in this age group already possess a current hunter education card.       In 2001 and following years additional GMU's would be added to the requirement.  According to the plan, hunter education would become universally required in Alaska beginning July 1, 2003.       The draft plan also calls for incentives for hunters to maintain their hunting skills and safety practices.  Surveys indicate that a large majority (over 80%) of Alaska hunters support some form of incentive system for the drawing-only hunts.  The draft program would offer voluntary advanced classes in topics such as survival, wilderness medicine, field care of game meat, marksmanship skills, tracking game animals, and calling big game.      Hunters applying for drawing-only hunts who completed two advanced clinics over a three-year period would have an additional random number entered in the annual drawing for the restricted entry hunts.  The steering group selected this incentive plan because first time applicants and hunters who do not choose to attend advanced clinics would still retain a reasonable chance to be drawn.      The draft plan calls for the development of a voluntary “master hunter” program patterned in part by the concept pioneered in Oregon and Utah.  Department surveys show that 83% of Alaska hunters support the implementation of a “master hunter” program.  These states and others are now using their “master hunter” program to certify small numbers of hunters for participation in highly sensitive hunts, typically in or near urban areas.       The intent of the “master hunter” program is to preserve hunting opportunities that would be lost in urban areas due to safety or competency concerns or regain lost hunting opportunities by placing highly proficient and safe hunters in areas where hunting was lost due to safety or animal wounding concerns.       In Minnesota, bow hunters have been able to create and maintain deer hunts within the metropolitan Minneapolis-St. Paul area by using this concept.  In Oregon, hunters have been able to reopen areas previously closed to hunting by certifying “master hunters.”  Volunteers for the “master hunter” program undergo approximately 160 hours of advanced training in topics including big game anatomy, media relations, and more.     The steering group is convinced that implementation of the draft plan is a “win-win” situation for Alaska's hunters.  This plan should dramatically reduce Alaska's alarming hunting accident rate, bolster public confidence in Alaska's hunters, and reduce hunting regulations violations. Alaska's hunters will reap the benefits of this plan by saving lives, preventing anti-hunting sentiment from reducing hunting opportunities, and perhaps regaining some of the hunting opportunities we have already lost.     Top of Document           Hunters Support New Concepts in Hunter Services    First Results From a Novel New Continuing Survey of Alaska Hunters by Tony Monzingo   ADF&G Hunter Services Coordinator      In 1994 the Department of Fish and Game and the Alaska State Legislature developed the Hunter Services program to provide hunters with the most current information and “how-to” tips on hunting in Alaska.  David Johnson, now retired, was ADF&Gs first Hunter Services program coordinator. David continues to participate in Alaska hunting issues as editor of the  Alaska Hunting Bulletin . Under his leadership, clinics such as “Bear Hunting,” “Becoming an Alaskan Hunter,” “Caribou and Moose Hunting,” and “Sheep and Goat Hunting” were initiated. The  clinic program  has been a resounding success from its inception.  Each year many of the clinics are sold out well in advance.       Women are taking to hunting in record numbers in Alaska and across America. In addition to the present clinics, many hunters have indicated interest in additional clinic topics that would be “hands-on” and assist in developing new hunting skills or sharpening skills they already possess.  In January 1997, the Hunter Services program began an on-going survey of Alaska hunters.  Hunters participating in the survey are provided descriptions of numerous topics for future hunting clinics.  Topics include such diverse hunting interests as handloading, marksmanship, animal tracking, muzzleloading, field care of wild game, photographing the hunt, and gun dog training.     Surveys show the most frequently requested clinic topics are field care of big game, survival for hunters, navigation for hunters, wilderness medicine, rifle marksmanship, calling big game, and animal tracking and sign identification.  In response to the survey the Hunter Services program will add new clinic topics during 1999.  As these clinics require a considerable amount of equipment and practice materials, the price will increase to cover costs.  Most of the new clinics will probably cost $20 to $25, according to ADF&G Hunter Education Coordinator John Matthews.      To insure plenty of personal attention and hands-on experience, each “hands-on” clinic will be limited to 24 hunters at a time. Hunters who complete a survey [see final paragraph for how to obtain a survey - Ed.] will have their names entered into the Hunter Services Program database.  When a clinic is scheduled, the Hunter Services program will send a personalized card or letter to every hunter on the list who has marked that clinic topic as a high priority.       Direct marketing is less expensive for the program and insures that hunters who have a high interest in a particular topic will have a chance to obtain the training, skills, or practice they want.  Clinics will initially be scheduled for Anchorage and Fairbanks.  They will be held in other communities as demand warrants.     It is easy to praise Alaskan hunters for their selection of clinic topics.  Numerous surveys of public opinion show that up to 80% of the non-hunting public supports hunting for food when the kill is swift and efficient.  Hunters who work hard to train and prepare themselves for the hunt are to be commended and will be rewarded with continued strong public support for their hunting heritage.    We found 77% of the Alaska hunters we surveyed strongly support special youth hunts. Youth hunts have quickly sprung up all around America.  Hunters are faced with growing evidence that the hunting community is aging rapidly and too few young adults are becoming hunters.  One of the greatest obstacles for youth interested in hunting is finding a place and opportunity to hunt.  Many states have set aside a weekend or two in specific areas for mentored youth hunts.  According to wildlife agency officials in those states, these hunts have been very successful in providing young people with both a place and an opportunity to develop hunting skills and enjoy the entire range of experiences associated with being outdoors during the hunting season.     Alaska's hunters also support reasonable proficiency requirements for firearms hunters.  The experience of bowhunters bears out the value of this idea.  In 1991, Alaska's bowhunters requested a proficiency test in conjunction with bow-hunter education classes.  The proficiency test was designed to reduce wounding loss and to preserve hunting opportunities in publicly visible and sensitive areas.  The results have been encouraging.  The number of bow hunters has not declined as a result of the proficiency requirement and wounding losses have declined.  The net result, according to bow hunter education instructors, has been the production of more efficient, skilled, and ethical bow hunters.     A large majority (78%) of the Alaska hunters we surveyed support extending proficiency testing to firearms hunting.  A reasonable proficiency standard should go a long ways in reducing avoidable wounding losses among big game and waterfowl.  Wounded animals may die a lingering death and high wounding losses detract from all hunters' opportunities by reducing available animals for harvest.  In permit-only areas, wounding loss contributes to a reduction in available permits.  A reasonable standard for proficiency would reduce wounding loss and increase public support for hunting as a quick and efficient means of sustained yield wildlife management.      Hunters who have not had the opportunity to complete a Hunter Services Survey may pick up a survey at their nearest Fish and Game office.  Hunters may request a survey by writing to Hunter Services, 333 Raspberry Road, Anchorage, AK 99518 or by calling (907) 267-2347 in Anchorage or (907) 459-7213 in Fairbanks.     Top of Document           Position Statement on Trapping and Snaring of Furbearers February 1998     [Editor's note: The signatures of sufficient Alaska voters were obtained to place an initiative on Alaska's November, 1998 General Election Ballot that would prohibit the use of snares in trapping wolves.  The following information is the summary information used in the petition booklets:   Bill Prohibiting Trapping Wolves With Snares – This bill would prohibit a person from using a snare with the intent of trapping a wolf. It would also prohibit a person from possessing, buying, selling, or offering to sell the skin of a wolf known by the person to have been caught with a snare. Breaking the law would be a misdemeanor. The penalty could be jail time of up to one year, and a fine of up to $5,000.]      The Alaska Department of Fish and Game supports regulated trapping and snaring as legitimate harvest methods for use of Alaska's furbearer resource.  Snaring and trapping are labor intensive harvest methods and trapper success rates are inherently low.  Trapping and snaring are regulated by the Alaska Board of Game to insure that harvests do not exceed sustained yields.  The Department recognizes public concerns regarding the issue of animal welfare in the context of trapping and snaring, and is dedicated to the continued improvement of trapping methods and equipment that conform to the principles of humane harvest.     Most trappers are careful to set their traps and snares properly.   Instances where snares do not kill immediately or catch other animals besides wolves are the exception.  The Department supports and promotes humane and ethical trapping using the best techniques available.   The Department participates in annual trapping schools to teach trappers responsible techniques and ethical considerations.     The following background information may help clarify some important points regarding the use of snares for trapping wolves in Alaska.     Snaring and other methods of trapping are strictly regulated in Alaska.  Trappers must abide by restrictions on the size of snare, use of bait, snowmachines, airplanes, boats, artificial lights, and radio communications.  Trappers 16 and older must be licensed.  Trappers are encouraged to attend special clinics where ethical and humane trapping principles are taught.     Department of Fish and Game biologists monitor wolf and other furbearer populations throughout the state to assure that populations remain healthy and are not overharvested.      The Department has been working at the national level to help develop trap standards to address the issue of humaneness.  It is also involved in studies to identify methods to make snaring and trapping as humane as possible.     Trapping is an important part of the economy in rural Alaska.  It is part of traditional fishing, hunting, and gathering activities.  In some rural communities in the Interior, as many as 87 percent of households trap for income.      Snares are particularly important in cash poor villages of Interior Alaska because they are the most effective way to trap wolves in areas of deep or frequent snowfall.     In addition to cash, trapping generates other products used by rural households, including food for human consumption (e.g., beaver, lynx, ptarmigan, and hare) and raw materials for clothing (especially cold weather gear for the head, hands and feet).     Snares are usually made of wire or cable.  They are designed to catch animals around the neck, torso or foot.  They can either be lethal or used only to restrain an animal.  Many wolf trappers prefer snares because they are lighter than other traps, less expensive, more effective than leghold traps during freezing and thawing weather, and remain operable after snowfalls.     Snares are legal in 39 of 49 states that have regulated trapping seasons as well as in all the Canadian provinces.     A 1992 Gallup survey found that 80 percent of Alaska trappers use snares and that 30 percent of their catch is taken by snaring.     In 1996-97, 1,280 wolves were harvested in Alaska.  Of these, 435 were taken in snares; 415 were shot; and 381 were trapped using other methods (mostly leg-hold traps).  Over the last five years, snares have accounted for an average of 29 percent of the wolves harvested each year in the state.     The Alaska Board of Game will review snaring and trapping regulations in March 1998.  At that time, the Board will consider public proposals for changes to snaring and trapping regulations to ensure that Alaskan trappers are using trapping equipment and methods that are consistent with the best conservation and management practices for the use of Alaska's furbearer populations.      Trapping furbearers has been economically and culturally important to Alaska's people for centuries.  The seasonal harvest of wildlife provides meat and warm clothing needed to sustain and enhance life in the North.  Historically, trapping was at the heart of trade in Alaska, and it is still a vital part of rural economies and cultures.  Like hunting, viewing, and photography, trapping is a legitimate use of our wildlife resource.     Top of Document           Caribou Identification Video Available by Craig Gardner Tok Area Wildlife Biologist      With antlers on both sexes, caribou bulls are sometimes difficult to distinguish from cows. In some hunts, moose must carry antlers larger than 50 inches. And in both cases, accurate identification is important.     No trouble distinguishing this as a large bull, but other caribou may not be so simple.  A new ADF&G video helps hunters learn to tell smaller bulls from cows. Photo by Paula Rak, courtesy of 40mile Air. In areas where caribou and moose hunts are restricted by sex of the animal or by antler characteristics, the regulations require hunters to accurately identify a legal animal—often under difficult circumstances. A poor decision in the field most likely will result in an illegal take. If illegal harvest is high, the resource and all hunters will suffer.      The Division of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) realizes that distinguishing a cow caribou from a small bull or determining if a bull moose has antlers greater than 50” in width can be difficult even under good conditions. To help hunters prepare for moose and caribou hunts in restricted areas, the DWC has developed two videos on identification of legal animals.      The video on moose identification has been available for three years.  It remains an excellent review of antler size judging. The video is available at most Fish and Game offices. The video on caribou identification was completed in July 1997.      Caribou hunters face a difficult task when hunting caribou in areas that limit harvest to bulls. Both male and female caribou have antlers.  Their antlers are often similar in size and conformation, particularly among cows and small bulls. Most hunters who mistakenly shoot cow caribou make bad decisions based on widely held misconceptions on how to distinguish young bulls from cow caribou.     The 10-minute video illustrates the different criteria that each hunter should use to identify caribou. These techniques work in almost all situations. The video also covers some of the most common misconceptions that are still held by many hunters. We discuss what proportion of the herd are bulls, how using antlers as the main identifier could cause a hunter to shoot a cow and pass up a bull, and the dangers of using mane color to distinguish between bulls and cows. One important theme of the video is this—if you are not sure that you are looking at a legal animal, do not shoot. The video is currently available at ADF&G offices in Tok, Fairbanks, Delta, and Anchorage.     Since the inception of bull-only caribou hunts, the ability of hunters to identify bull caribou has improved.  This has resulted in reduced illegal cow harvest. However, in some areas the number of illegal animals is still unacceptably high. We have found, in general, that hunters with the least caribou hunting experience make the most mistakes.      As a caribou hunter, your ability to accurately identify a legal animal is essential for the success of many management programs and for the continuance of extended hunting seasons and increased quotas. A little preparation can help ensure that hunting does not limit population increases and could lead to increased hunting opportunities in some areas.     Please, before hunting caribou in areas restricting harvest to bulls only, watch this video.  We think you will be pleased that you did.  Thank you for helping our caribou management programs succeed.     Top of Document           *** Newsbreaks ***      Fairbanksans will enjoy fishing, hunting and wildlife-related activities at Fairbanks Fun Day  on May 30.  The day is designed to introduce young people and adults to fishing, hunting and wildlife-related outdoor recreation.  DWC biologist Cathie Harms says young people of all ages will find something of interest.  She says a “Pathway to Fishing” has been designed to help beginners learn the sport and there will be even a fishing pond stocked with grayling, rainbows and arctic char for new anglers.  Among other activities she anticipates this year are archery instruction and shooting, a discovery hunt for clues about wildlife, opportunities to shoot pellet rifles under the watchful eyes of trained instructors, and more.  The program will start at 11 AM and ends at 4 PM on Saturday, May 30.  Additional information can be obtained by calling the Fairbanks ADF&G office at (907) 459-7206.      The Southern Alaska Peninsula caribou herd appears to have “bottomed out.”   Area wildlife biologist Dick Sellers of King Salmon says the herd is hovering around the 2,000 - 3,000 animal mark—down from its peak in recent years of 10,000 in 1983.  Sellers says the herd remains closed to hunting except for a subsistence use quota of 100 animals for Peninsula villages. ADF&G and USFWS staff intend to deploy some additional radio collars within the herd to determine if interchange is taking place between the SAP and the Northern Alaska Peninsula herd.  Deteriorating caribou range was clearly the reason for the decline in the last 15 years, Sellers says.  Biologists now have to determine whether range has recovered enough to support a population increase.       Meanwhile the Northern Alaska Peninsula herd continues at about one-half its peak in the mid-1980s.  Sellers says ADF&G worked to reduce herd size in the late 1980s and early 1990s to better match herd size and range conditions.  The increased harvest worked fine until about 1993 when the herd dropped several thousand animals in one year, a drop that still puzzles biologists.  Today the herd numbers approximately 10,000 animals.  The good news, Sellers says, is that the herd is reasonably productive, with around 30 calves per 100 cows.  Range conditions are not as bad as further south on the peninsula.  Until range conditions further improve, Sellers and his colleagues believe the herd should be maintained at about the present level.     Alaskans will vote to decide whether snaring should be allowed in Alaska  at the polls on Election Day this November.  This is an important issue for Alaskans, biologists say.  Additional background information on this issue and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's position on the matter can be found in a  separate article  in this issue.       Alaska bear researchers captured a 10-year-old male grizzly bear last summer whose 28-1/4 inch skill would place him at the top of the Boone and Crockett record book.   Last June, the bear's weight was 680 pounds, but by fall, this bear could have reached 900 pounds. The researchers were taking tissue samples from bears to determine familial relationships through DNA examination, and to learn more about what rates of hunter harvest are sustainable.  ADF&G bear research biologist Harry Reynolds, UAF Institute of Arctic Biology veterinarian John Blake, and Russian biologist Mikhail Kretchmar have been cooperating in the study.  The US Army and Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration have also been supporting the project. Reynolds hopes to use the data to measure rates of immigration of bears into the Alaska Range population.  He predicts the study will show that most females in the population live their entire lifetimes near the area of their birth so that bears in a specific locality are more likely to be related to one another.  In contrast, he predicts that males living in the same area were born in far away and immigrate into the area.  This pattern would avoid inbreeding of the population while allowing females the advantages of known food supplies and places of safety for bears.      The third annual  Becoming An Outdoor-Woman  program was held in Juneau  on July 11-13 last summer at the University of Alaska Southeast. Fifty women tried their hand at kayaking, filleting fish, field dressing deer, map and compass, survival, shooting skills, Dutch oven cooking, and many other outdoor activities.  Knowledgeable local and out of town instructors, many of whom were ADF&G staff, generously volunteered their time.  In addition to daytime classes, a variety of evening programs was offered on both Friday and Saturday nights. A round robin of demonstration tables gave women the opportunity to learn basic skills, including how to sharpen a knife, clean a firearm, or bait a halibut hook.  Guest speakers told hair-raising bear stories and talked about hunting, fishing, and camping throughout Alaska.  Ketchikan area biologist, Doug Larsen participated as a key-note speaker, showing slides and sharing stories and outdoor pointers with participants, and Vern Beier related accounts of several of his bear hunting and research-related experiences with brown bears.  The finale was a fashion show of women's outdoors clothing.  The participants were enthusiastic and both students and instructors seemed to enjoy the weekend.     One objective of the program was for women to meet other like-minded outdoors enthusiasts to go hunting and fishing with.  One lucky woman not only found a kayaking partner, but also a job through the contacts she made at the Juneau BOW.  That same woman also won a sleeping bag as a door prize.  Many women requested day-long workshops that built on the skills they had learned.  Suggestions included a shotgun class for women, a class on canning fish, and saltwater fishing and boating. ADF&G biologist Anne Post reports that because of the positive experience of the BOW program, a group called “Beyond BOW” has formed in Juneau.  The group now has 50 members. Members hold monthly meetings which feature lectures, demonstrations and a chance to practice outdoors skills. In addition, they plan boating, hunting, and hiking trips and are pursuing one-day weekend classes for women in shooting and other outdoors skills to build on what was learned at the BOW workshop.     Glennallen area biologist Bob Tobey reports the Copper River and Chitina River bison herds are both increasing.   Tobey attributes improved counts to better calf survival during the previous two winters.  The Copper River herd numbered 87 with 17 calves when he counted it last summer, and the Chitina herd numbered 46 with seven calves.  He expects herd numbers to look good again this summer because of the mild winter just past.      Steel Shot Shoots Skeet in Juneau : Douglas area biologist Matt Robus worked with waterfowl hunting consultant Tom Roster to present his CONSEP clinic to an enthusiastic Juneau audience during late last summer.  This program is aimed at improving waterfowling skills and reducing wounding losses.  The program kicked off with a Friday evening seminar where Roster made points about the need for hunter recruitment and why reduction of crippling is essential to the continuation of waterfowl hunting.  The classroom was packed with more than 70 people. On the range the next day, each person was tested for ability to hit a crossing target at 20 yards.  The group then went through exercises on distance estimation and shotgun patterning.  This helped everyone see the relationship between distance and lethality.  Then, Roster coached every participant until they were hitting at least six out of eight clays at thirty yards.  Despite considerable difficulties arranging a shooting site and dealing with a roughly handled shipment of clay targets, the clinic was well received by participants.       The fall 1997 brown bear season on the Kenai Peninsula was closed by emergency order for the third year in a row.   The harvest objective was reached when a moose hunter shot a collared sow.  The three-year-old sow surprised the hunter on a trail and was shot at about fifteen paces.  A train about five miles north of Moose Pass killed another collared female.  The sow apparently was feeding on the remains of a hunter-killed moose near the tracks and was using the tracks as her access route.  The bear was walking down the tracks and made no attempt to get off until the last instant. The hide was salvaged for auction.  The incident brought the total mortality to thirteen bears, seven of them females. There is some evidence that one other bear may have been taken illegally.       Biologists see allowable PWS mountain goat harvest more than doubling  to 104 animals for the 1998/99 season.  Cordova area biologist Roy Nowlin says surveys in nine Prince William Sound goat count areas indicate the goat population recovery that began two years ago continues.  Conservative harvest rates of less than five percent of counts and hunting closures during the early- and mid-1990s likely improved the speed and strength of the recovery.       A mid-summer, 1997 sheep survey of a portion of the western Alaska Range (ARW) suggests the population has changed little  since the area was counted in 1979 and 1986.  ADF&G McGrath area biologist Jack Whitman and a survey team sampled 11 count areas, and classified a little under 1,200 sheep.  These and data from 1994 and 1995 comprise the most recent data for an area covering 1,500 square miles.  This is about half of the Dall sheep habitat within GMU 19C.  Whitman says about 3,400 sheep currently reside in the GMU 19C segment of the ARW.  He says additional 600-700 sheep probably inhabit GMUs 16 and 19B, bringing the total ARW sheep population to approximately 4,200-4,300 sheep.  This number coincides roughly with the earlier population estimates.  The team observed approximately 18 legal rams per100 ewes and 28 lambs per100 ewes.      Yearling moose survival appears to have increased dramatically in the intensive management zone in eastern GMU 19D.    ADF&G staff flew calving surveys in late spring and summer last year and observed that calf percentages in the herd peaked by June 29 at 44 percent, then declined to about 25 percent by July 10.  This pattern is similar to that observed during the previous three years. Whitman believes the improvement of yearling survival was probably due to mild winter conditions during 1996-97, as well as a significant increase in the wolf harvest.  Fall, 1997 moose surveys verified the trend, he said.      The federal government is moving toward a simple new grazing lands policy  that should dramatically reduce the potential of transmission of domestic animal diseases to wildlife.  The Bureau of Land Management policy would establish buffer zones around wild sheep habitat.  Grazing of domestic sheep would not be allowed in these buffer zones.  Division of Wildlife Conservation wildlife disease specialist Dr. Randy Zarnke says the policy was discussed at a meeting of the Western Wildlife Health Cooperative (WWHC) in Reno last summer.  WWHC representatives asked that the policy be extended to lands managed by the US Forest Service and the US Fish and Wildlife Service as well.  Zarnke asked that it also be extended to Alaska.  He says that if this policy were extended to lands managed by the State of Alaska, the potential for devastating domestic animal disease transmission could be reduced substantially.  On another disease issue, Zarnke says that “chronic wasting disease” (CWD), the cervid equivalent of “mad cow disease,” has recently appeared in captive and free-ranging elk and deer in Wyoming and Colorado.  The WWHC agreed it would be prudent to limit movement of game farm cervids from those two states until CWD is better understood.  The implications for Alaska are that importation of these animals from these states should be limited or excluded until this disease is understood.       Fairbanks Wildlife Conservation staff are in the final stages of planning an indoor shooting range  that will be constructed on state land across from ADF&G headquarters on College Road.  Regional Hunter Education coordinator Bob Hunter says the legislature appropriated $2.5 million for the project that should dramatically improve firearms and hunting training in the community.  Hunter expects ground to be broken for the project by mid-summer and a completed project by early 1999.  The facility will have two classrooms with a capacity of 75 students and ten shooting lanes.  The shooting lanes are designed for small bore rifles and will also accommodate some large bore handgun shooting.       The Kenai chapter of Safari Club International was granted a cultural education permit to take a moose in December.   Several SCI members and Soldotna area biologist Ted Spraker, took 12 high school students and a couple of parents on the moose hunt. Prior to the hunt, students were required to take a hunter education course and discuss their hunt plans. A forked antler bull was shot on the first day.  Each student was required to assist in field dressing the moose and helped pack the meat to a vehicle.  After the meat hung for three days, students and instructors met again to butcher the meat.  The finished products were divided among the students. Students were selected by their high school principals and had to be from a single-parent household, needy, and show an interest in learning about hunting and how to care for a harvested animal.  SCI plans to request this permit annually in an effort to educate young people who otherwise would not be exposed to hunting and game management.      The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) officially opposes reintroduction of wood bison on the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge  at this time.  In a letter, Regional Director Dave Allen stated, “...if wood bison were not historically present on the Yukon Flats, the Service cannot support this proposal as an endangered species recovery effort, nor can we consider the species part of the natural diversity of the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge.”  FWS is not persuaded by oral history provided by 13 Athabaskan elders describing the presence of bison in Interior Alaska within the last 200-300 years, nor by other scientific evidence including sub fossils of wood bison found in the region.       A plan to extend the Coastal Trail southeast from Kincaid Park to the Potter weigh station threatens wildlife habitats  on the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge (ACWR) and operation of one of Alaska's most important shooting ranges.  The Coastal Trail now extends approximately eight miles from downtown Anchorage to Kincaid Park at the tip of the peninsula in Cook Inlet on which Anchorage sits.  The paved trail is popular with hikers, joggers, bikers, and other recreationists.  The idea of a trail extension along the south side of the peninsula is widely popular, but locating the trail is the problem.  Anchorage Wildlife Biologist Rick Sinnott points out that the ACWR is one of the largest wildlife refuges in any city anywhere, and that a trail cutting through it, as some have proposed, could substantially degrade wildlife habitats.  Sinnott says the refuge is now largely protected from extensive human activity by limited public access.  A paved trail would bring large numbers of people onto the refuge.  A heavily-used trail and waterfowl hunting are probably not compatible in the refuge.  The trail could also negatively change the nature of these tidal and estuarine wetlands by creating impoundments and changing water flow patterns.  Also at risk is the Rabbit Creek Rifle Range, run by the Department of Fish and Game and serving thousands of shooters during snow-free months.  Some potential trail routes would force closure of parts of the range, which is now used not only for shooting, but also for hunter education training.  The rifle range property is also home for a regional hunter education training facility.  Sinnott says the planning process is still ongoing and trail routing is still up in the air.  He suggests hunters and other users of the refuge and the rifle range should be sure to make their views known to the consultants preparing the plan: Sarah Barton or Mark Dalton at HDR Alaska (274-2000).     Top of Document           From the Director...The Way I See It by Dr. Wayne L. Regelin      Lots of good things are happening in our Hunter Services and Hunter Education programs.  First, we merged these into one program this year and renamed it the Hunter Information and Training program.  This change was the product of numerous discussions with Hunter Education instructors, staff, and members of the hunting public across the state, and it has proven to be a good one.  A lot has been happening!     The goal of the Hunter Information and Training program is to promote and ensure safe, responsible and ethical behavior of hunters in the field.  There are many aspects of this program—ranging from Alaska's basic hunter education class to providing services to hunters that include events or products such as the  Hunter Clinics ,  Becoming an Outdoor Woman , the  Alaska Hunting Bulletin , and proficiency training.  This program is under the capable direction of Tony Monzingo and John Matthews.     This program will be expanding over the next three years.  The legislature has provided a capital improvement project for this program that provides stable funding that will allow us to greatly expand our efforts to assist hunters.   We will expand the very popular hunter clinic series into more communities and offer more courses in the larger towns.  Nearly all of our clinics are sold out.  Even those who have hunted for years seem to be eager to enhance their skills, pick up tips from other experienced hunters, and share their knowledge.  We will expand the Becoming an Outdoor Woman program to offer it more times each year.  The demand for this program continues to increase as more women hear about it.      This year we purchased two laser shooting systems that are very popular with the public, particularly young beginners.  We will purchase a third laser shooting system that will be housed in a mobile trailer that can travel the road and ferry system.  This is an excellent way to expose kids to shooting and is a valuable tool for hunter education.     Thanks for your continued support and good hunting.

GX024-96-5031880	"Why Do We Hunt?                    W       atch a springer spaniel wriggle and squirm ecstatically as it's being led afield to nose up pheasants and you understand a little bit better what goes on inside human hunters as summer turns to fall.    We may not wriggle, but walking down a forest trail to a deer stand or wading in mud flats to set out a raft of decoys triggers in hunters irrepressible excitement and pleasure.    Going hunting is like quenching a thirst, scratching an itch. It seems to satisfy a deep, human need.    Hunting is basic to our natures. As long as people have populated earth they have taken the lives of other species to feed themselves.    In terms of human time, we've only recently domesticated animals; for most of our history, the meat people have eaten was taken from the carcasses of wild animals they captured and killed.    Social anthropologists maintain that our unique and complicated social organization and language evolved because coordination and communication were necessary to successfully hunt large and dangerous game.    Hunting may have also spurred our aesthetic impulses. Certainly, some of the first evidence we have of our species; artistic nature, manifested in the cave paintings of Lascaux, France, were stylized representations of animals and the human hunters that pursued them.    When human life and so many human qualities owe their existence to hunting, it seems preposterous that newly organized animal rights groups could claim hunting is inhuman.    Hunters needn't apologize for hunting. They follow their instinct and their part is clear and straightforward. Hunters allow no middlemen, salesmen, marketing experts, chefs or grocers to trick them into thinking their lives don't rely on the death of other animals. For hunters, the formula is as simple as nature herself: an animal is harvested to feed the hunter's family.    Nor is hunting cruel. Game animals aren't caged, fattened, bred, jam together or raised on production lines. They live in forests, clearings and wetlands, following the natural instincts of their species.    Some fall day, a hunter's bullet may end a wild animal's life. Animal rights activists often dwell on that exact moment, seeming to forget that death is the fate of all living things. A hunter's bullet is usually clean and quick. Good hunters insist on it.    Thanks to hunters' interest in maintaining sustainable populations of game animals and to many dollars generated for wildlife management through license sales and special taxes on hunting equipment, the number of deer, turkey, squirrel and other game species are stable or increasing. Other species, such as the giant Canada goose, have been brought back from the brink of extinction.    Regulated hunting seasons and bag limits keep animal populations in check and prevent a repeating boom and bust cycle of overabundance followed by disease and mass starvation.                                                        Hunters     allow no middlemen, salesmen, marketing experts, chefs or grocers     to trick them into thinking their lives don't rely on the death     of other animals.                                              Hunting also brings into balance those who go afield. Hunting rewards alertness, patience, self-restraint. It demands stealth, keen vision, a knowledge of the quarry and its environment. Those who refuse to learn the ways of the woods are seldom successful.    It's true, hunters could buy their meat in sanitized, foam and plastic containers from the supermarkets, leaving the killing to others. By doing so, however, they'd sacrifice their sense of self-reliance, of individuality, of participation in the natural world.    ""If they only didn't seem to enjoy it so much,"" some people complain, as if hunting would be acceptable if it were dull, tedious work.    But hunting provides many pleasures, including lifelong companions, loyal and hard-working dogs, the earthy scents of linseed oil and decaying leaves.    Every bit of a hunt is somehow satisfyingplanning, scouting, packing sandwiches to eat on a downed log, driving in the darkness to reach a hunting stand before first light, listening to the forest awake, being startled by nearby snap of a twig...    And yes, a hunter who successfully brings down a swift, intelligent and graceful prey animal does experience happiness and pride.    If it were not forever so, humans wouldn't be on this planet today.   Tom Cwynar       Hunting is a great way to learn more about wildlife and nature and to carve your own personal niche in the cycle of life. Hunters don't just observe nature, we participate. We become immersed in the birds and animals we seek and constantly strive to learn more about them. We scout, plan, and anticipate. Hunting is also great fun. It's and outstanding way to forge strong bonds with family and friends.    Kathy Etling   Outdoor Writer       Hunting is one form of exercise that I truly enjoy...being in the woods...seeing everything in its natural state...breathing the fresh air...and watching my grandson's progress in his learning of the hunting skills. I also enjoy the feeling that I am helping nature keep things in balance, through the licenses and taxes I pay on supplies, which helps the Missouri Conservation Department do the great job it is doing.    Willis Corbett   Lobbyist       Hunting lets me escape urban trappings and reconnect with nature. I'm glad to have a season when I can leave plastic, concrete, car horns, computers, commercials and manipulating people behind and participate in the simple and stark world of predator vs. prey. Hunting requires and develops self-discipline, cunning and patience, talents I believe valuable, even in these modern times.    Tom Cwynar   Writer/Editor       Facts About Hunting        Safety    Statistics show there is only one accident for every 10,000 hunters.   In fact, of all the accidental deaths in 1987, only two percent   involved firearms, much less than drowning, suffocation and burns.   To further reduce hunting accidents, the Conservation Department   requires hunter safety training for everyone born on or after   January 1,1967. Over 500,000 Missourians have received hunter   safety certificates.    Stable wildlife populations    A healthy deer herd on suitable habitat can be reduced by as   much as 40 percent with no ill effect on populations; hunters   rarely take more than 15 percent. If not harvested, a deer herd   can double in size in only two years, quickly deplete available   food supplies and face certain starvation. Quail have an annual   mortality rate of 75 to 85 percent, whether they are hunted or   not.    Funds for all wildlife    Through license fees and taxes on equipment, hunters and anglers   contribute an average of $3 million  each day  to wildlife   conservation. Habitat improvement that benefits quail likewise   helps songbirds; land that's acquired or managed for deer or   turkey also provides homes for foxes, bobcats, other mammals   and many species of birds.

GX034-82-10884589	"Noatak National Preserve       Originally created through Presidential proclamation as Noatak National Monument in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter, the monument became Noatak National Preserve in December 1980 with the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA, Public Law 996-487).  The preserve was to be managed in order to ""maintain the environmental integrity of the Noatak River and adjacent uplands"" (NPS 1985), to protect wildlife habitat and populations, and protect  archaeological resources in order to provide opportunities for scientific research.     The preserve covers 6,574,481 acres in northwestern Alaska.  It is bordered on the west by Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve (GAAR), to the south by Kobuk Valley National Park (KOVA) and to the west by Cape Krusenstern National Monument (CAKR).  Bering Land Bridge National Park and Preserve (BELA) lies to the southwest, just across Kotzebue Sound.  The Noatak River originates in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve to the east, and flows westward through the Noatak River basin that makes up the central portion of the NOAT preserve.  Eventually the river exits the preserve at its western border, makes a turn south, and empties into Kotzebue Sound, just north of the city of Kotzebue.   The monument is not accessible by road.  Instead, primary access is limited to either air or boat traffic.  During the winter months, snowmachine and dog sled travel are common.  All forms of travel are dependent on weather conditions.   The preserve, along with CAKR and KOVA, is administered from headquarters in Kozebue, Alaska as part of the Northwest Alaska Areas Office (NWAK).   Land Ownership     Of the 6,574,481 acres within the preserve, non-federal lands make up approximate 22% of the preserve, or 289,973 acres, and consist of a variety of Native allotments under application, easements areas selected by Nana Regional Corporation, and other village corporations, and State of Alaska navigable waters.      Environment     The preserve combines two climatic themes.  Near the coast a maritime climate prevails, while the interior experiences a continental climate with more extreme variations in temperatures and precipitation.  Temperatures in the summer range from the low 30's to the high 60's degrees Farenheit.  Winter temperatures range from -20 to 0 degrees (F).  Wind chill factors are common during the winter months, with temperatures as low as -70 degrees (F) being experienced.    The Brooks Range geosyncline and the accompanying Arctic Foothills and Arctic Coastal Plain were all in place by the late Paleozoic era.  By the Cretaceous, after a period of mountain-building processes, the Brooks Range dominated the area and volcanic activity was a common occurrence south of the range.  Shale, chert, and limestone make up the bedrock geology of the DeLong Mountains, which are part of the Brooks Range.  Intrusions of igneous rocks, as a result of nearby volcanic activity, occur as well.  The lowland areas of the Noatak drainage are made up of sedimentary materials, including siltstones, sandstones and limestones.  Unconsolidated deposits of gravel, clay, silt and sand are concentrated in the lower areas of the Noatak drainage.   The area was glaciated in the past, but was not covered completely during the last (Wisconsin) glaciation.  Instead, mostly the upland areas were glaciated.  The landscape exhibits typical glacial features such as U-shaped valleys, braided streams, kames, kettles, morraines and alluvial till.  Permafrost is discontinuous throughout the lowlands of the perserve, but continuous below the Baird and DeLong mountains.   Wildlife is the primary natural resource of the preserve and include caribou, moose, Dall sheep, grizzly bear, wolf, fox, lynx, marten, beaver and muskrat.  Small mammals such as the hoary marmot, arctic ground squirrels, lemmings and porcupine also exist within the preserve.  A variety of bird life inhabits the preserve, particularly during the summer migratory season, when thousands of birds congregate in the arctic for breeding.  The Canada goose, white-fronted goose, tundra swan, and all four species of loon are common in the preserve.  Raptors (golden eagles, gyrfalcon and rough-legged hawks) nest along the Noatak drainage in the rocky cliffs of tributaries.  The arctic peregrine falcon is the only threatened species known to occur in the preserve.     The Noatak River is considered key in the subsistence and commercial fisheries harvest for Northwest Alaska.  The most common fish, Arctic grayling and Arctic char, are found in the Noatak River and its tributaries.  Salmon occur throughout the Noatak drainage system, with Chum being the most abundant, and sockeye, pinks and king found in the lower reaches of the river.  Sheefish inhabit the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers in the preserve and are considered a preferred subsistence item.  Trout are found in the deeper lakes within the preserve, as are burbot and freshwater cod.   Vegetation within the preserve is predominately low mat tundra.  The lower Noatak drainage contains a boreal forest cover.  At higher elevations, an alpine tundra community can be found, with willow, heather and combinations of grasses, sedges, wildglowers andmosses.  Drier areas support lichens and saxifrages.  Moist tundra community occurs along the foothills of the Noatak Valley.  This is the predominant vegetation of the preserve and consists of cottongrass, willow, dwarf birch, labrador tea, Lapland rosebay, mountain alder and avens.  Bog rosemary and cranberry are found in wetter areas as are salmonberry and a variety of mosses.  A spruce forest community, consisting of white spruce, paper birch, aspen, poplar and black spruce, occur sporadically throughout the preserve and are generally located along the south-facing foothills and valley bottoms.    Archeological Resources     Archeological investigations of the Noatak River drainage began in the early 1940's and have continued through the years.  In spite of this, however, very little is actually known about the cultural prehistory of the preserve.  This is in part due to the fact that few of the investigations carried out have been reported, that few full-scale excavations have occurred, and that preservation within sites is poor (see Hall 1974).  Paleo-Indian occupation within the preserve is postulated on the basis of isolated finds of fluted points.  The discovery of Paleo-Indian remains at the Mesa site, located in BLM-managed land in northern Alaska (north of the preserve), coupled with its recently assigned 11,700 BP year old date gives further evidence that these peoples were likely to have occupied portions of the preserve.  Recent finds, as yet unreported, of similar materials have been located within the Noatak Drainage system in the preserve.   Sites representing the Paleoarctic tradition and dating between 10,000 and 7,000 BP are also thought to occur within the preserve.  This, too, is based on evidence collected in the surrounding area.  Early microblade and core sites possibly associated with the early Paleoarctic tradition are generally thought to date in the Kotzebue Sound area between 10,000 and 7000 BP.  Deposits at Trail Creek Caves in the Bering Land Bridge National Park and Preserve to the south contain Paleoarctic tradition remains dated to 9000 BP and an even deeper and earlier human occupation was postulated on the basis of modified animal bones (the famous calcaneous) that were interpreted a reflecting human activities, dating to approximately 13,000 BP.  This interpretation, while not disproved, is presently considered tentative.  The Paleoarctic tradition typical assemblage, containing microblades, microcores (often wedge-shaped), flake burins and large bifaces, shows definite affinities with archeological assemblages in northeast Asia, such as the Dyuktai culture of Siberia.   Remains representing the Northern Archaic tradition were found at the Palisades site at Cape Krusenstern (CAKR) and at Onion Portage on the Kobuk River (KOVA), also outside of the NOAT preserve area.  As it is generally considered a culture of the interior it seems likely this occupation would occur within the preserve.  Northern Archaic remains also occur in Anuktuvuk Pass, to the east in Gates of the Arctic National Preserve, and other scattered locations in northern Alaska.  It is thought to be an occurrence resulting from the expansion of the northern boreal forests, related to a climatic warming period, and a concomitant expansion of people and/or cultures from the boreal forests and Archaic cultures south and east of Alaska, in the Southwest Yukon (Giddings and Anderson 1986).  The Palisades collection contained ""corner-notched points, regular-edged unifaces, and the end scrapers"" as well as ""crude cobble and core tools...and a single shouldered point"" and was ultimately assigned a 6,000 BP date.   The Arctic Small Tool Tradition (ASTt) was first recognized in the Denbigh Flint Complex of the Iyatayet site on Cape Denbigh, along the southeastern margins of the Seward Peninsula.  ASTt has been defined as the early development of an economy that exploited sea mammals and resources of the hinterland.  People of this tradition spread across the arctic, as far east as Hudson's Bay and as far south as the Alaska Peninsula, as a recognizable technology.  The origins of this technology are somewhat obscure but certainly developed around the Bering Strait.  Some artifact types appear in the eastern Siberian Belkachi culture but the manufacture and use of burin spall artifacts seems to be unique to the North American Arctic.  ASTt first developed about 4200 BP and continued through a series of related cultures, ending with the Ipiutak culture around 1000 BP.  Other complexes generally included Choris, Norton, near Ipiutak, and Ipiutak.  Some scholars see the Norton tradition as a separate line of development instead of as part of this continuum.   The Northern Maritime tradition, which includes Birnirk, Western Thule, and Kotzebue Period cultures, dates from approximately AD 600 to the early 19th century.  This tradition is considered the prehistoric expression of the modern historic Eskimo culture of the North American Arctic.  Birnirk, the initial expression of the Alaskan Northern Maritime tradition occurred on the eastern side of Bering Strait at a time when Punuk culture was developing on Siberian shores and the St. Lawrence Islands.  The Alaska developments are generally held to be ultimately northeast Asian in origin.  However, Birnirk and Ipiutak coexisted for several hundred years on the eastern side of Bering Strait.  Thus, the relationship between Northern Maritime (and modern Eskimo) and the preceding Arctic Small Tool tradition cultures remains an important and interesting research domain.  Birnirk sites have been found at Cape Krusenstern, Cape Prince of Wales and Cape Nome, i.e. on all sides of the preserve.  The Arctic Woodland Culture represents peoples taht moved inland full-time and developed a specialized inland lifestyle to take advantage of non-marine resources that had traditionally been a portion of the ""Northern Maritime"" tradition.   The succeeding Western Thule culture is dated between AD 950 and 1400.  It is a continuation of a mixed sea and land mammal based economy but with a major emphasis on bowhead whale hunting.  Western Thule culture followed ASTt cultures in spreading across the arctic.  Western Thule settlements were large coastal villages, usually near whale migration routes.  Use of thick, grit-tempered curvilinear-stamped pottery continued.  Ground slate butchering implements and weapon insets replaced the flaked stone implements used in the preceding Birnirk period.  By this time, the seal oil lamp, toggling harpoons, umiak, and dogs were present and in full use.  The Kotzebue culture period, between AD 1400 and 1850, is seen as a direct outgrowth of the Western Thule culture and links the prehistoric and early historic Inupiat cultures.  Kotzebue period sites and remains are more numerous than those of any preceding culture and have been documented around the full extent of Kotzebue Sound.  Sites dating to this time period have been found at Wales and the southern Seward Peninsula, indicating an increasing population.  Extensive trading networks and communications were maintained over northwest Alaska, the Seward Peninsula, and across the Bering Strait into Siberia.     Historical Aspects     Prior to actual contact with western civilizations in the 1850's, the peoples inhabiting the Noatak Valley obtained Russian goods from the eastern Siberian native peoples with whom they had established extensive trade ties across the Bering Straits.  At this time two related Eskimo groups were living the region:  the Naupaktomiut (Lower Noatak) and the Noatagmiut (Middle and Upper Noatak).  The groups from the Kotzebue and Kobuk River areas made regular hunting and trading excursions into the Noatak area.  Archaeological evidence shows that in the late 1600's people were living in large villages along lake shores, but this changed around 1800 when temporary camps became more predominant.   Contact brought a host of new activities and severe disruption of the traditional native lifestyle.   Initial contact brought exposure to new diseases for which the native populations had no natural immunity, causing a drastic population decline as whole families were wiped out.  The commercial whaling enterprises and the fur trade introduced cash economy into the lifestyle, the ramifications of which are still being struggled with.  And the introduction of Christianity brought major changes in the interaction between the native peoples and their environment.     Initial exploration by western civilization began in the 18th century with vessels sailing along the coastline.  In 1826 Beechey surveyed Kotzebue Sound.  Martin, from the H.M.S. Plover visited the lower Noatak in the Winter of 1850 and Stoney and Howard made winter trips in 1885 to the upper Noatak through the Kobuk region.  In that same summer,  S.B. McLenegan travelled up the Noatak River by boat and eventually published a map of the river valley.     The Klondike gold rush of 1898 brought prospectors into the Kobuk and Noatak valleys and eventually lead to more formal geological exploration and mapping of the area in the early 1900's.     In 1908 the California Yearly Meeting Friends Church began a federally funded mission school in Noatak village.  This mission soon became the center for schooling, trading, and religion for the native peoples, causing the virtual abandonment of the upper Noatak basin by 1915 and establishing the village of Noatak as a large permanent settlement.     Ethnographic Aspects     Despite drastic population reductions and dislocations beginning in the latter half of the 19th century, the descendants of the early 19th century populace remain in northwestern Alaska.  These descendants still derive a significant portion of their sustenance and identity from the land and its resources.  More so than in other parklands in Alaska (except Anakatuvuk Pass within GAAR) and in the continental United States (except Canyon de Chelly), the human-land relationship extending into parklands is strong.  The life experiences, oral traditions, traditional knowledge and current endeavors of the Inupiat of northwestern Alaska are rooted in the landscape and its resources.    Archaeological, ethnographic, historic and contemporary perspectives perforce overlap and become blurred.  Many current practices are discernable transformations of traditional activities.  For example, the timing and kinds of activities held at Thanksgiving ad Christmas and at the NANA Regional Corporation's annual meeting identify these gatherings as modern counterparts of the fall ""kivgiq"" or messenger feats and the ""katirut"" or annual gathering of the members of each of the early 19th century societies.  The traditional ""qatngut"" or trade fair, drawing visitors from as far away as Uelen in Chukotka was held at Sisualik or Kotzebue in early July throughout the 19th century.  Visitors from Little Diomede Island continued their trading visits through the 1950s.  This traditional meeting of neighbors, partners and kin is now incorporated into the American Fourth of July celebration.  Although modern equipment is used, caribou are still killed while crossing the river in the vicinity of Onion Portage, just as they have been for millennia.   The Inupiat residents and neighbors of NOAT are park resources in several real senses.  ANILCA-guaranteed subsistence use of parkland resources highlights an ecosystem continuum that includes man.  Using the ""direct historical method"" or ""upstreaming"", anthropological researches can link the Inupiat users of NOAT to the archeological manifestation known as the ""Arctic Woodland Culture"" which began about 1250 A.D.  Some researchers has extended more tenuous ethnic linkages far back as ""Denbigh Flint complex"" times, about 4,000 years ago.   In order to identify and evaluate any ethnographic resources within the park units, the Service must work cooperatively with the Inupiat.  Place-names, gravesites and old villages acquire meaning and significance through Inupiat traditional knowledge and lore.  The function and social context of items of material culture no longer in use may only be understood through the memories of Inupiat Elders.   ANILCA recognizes the resource value of local communities to the parks and other conservation units and contains provisions for local hire.   Ethnographic coverage of the region is spotty and only spans the last thirty years.  Thirty years ago anthropologists had the opportunity to work with Elders whose grandparents', and in some cases parents', memories of customs and life prior to sustained Euroamerican contacts were clear.  According to Burch, who began his research in the region in the 1960s, comprehensive and integrated views of the 19th century no longer may be obtained from single persons, but must be painstakingly reconstructed from bits and patches of information obtained from many persons.   The preceding comment should not be taken mean that opportunities for ethnographic research are absent.  Rich data pertaining to the last ninety years is available.  For example, several families within the region have four living generations of same-gender adults; comparative generational life histories of families can provide powerful insights into changing values, customs and into changing relations with polities and economies outside the region.  Written records of reindeer herding are available from the turn of the century through the 1950s and can be supplemented by personal accounts of living persons who once herded deer.  Many people can fully describe the rigors of a subsistence lifestyle before outboard motors, snowmachines, scheduled air traffic, radio and television and jet-delivered groceries, hardware and drygoods.   Two studies that are in preparation should provide excellent ethnoarcheological data as well as baseline data for archeological interpretation.  In the early 1980s, NANA commissioned Ernest S. Burch, Jr. to prepare a ten volume encyclopedia for the region.  Burch has conducted research on the region for more than thirty years and his unpublished notes and command of the anthropological literature is unequaled.  Volume II, Geology, and Volume V, The Inupiaq Nations of Northwest Alaska, have been published.  Proposed Volumes VI - X cover ethnographic topics from the early 19th century to the present.    In 1987 ARO-NPS let a three year contract to the University of Alaska Fairbanks to prepare a multiphase ethnographic study of CAKR, KOVA, and NOAT.  No final products have been delivered.  Apart from a 15,000+ record database documenting placenames, the kinds of products to be delivered and their contents remain negotiable.  Hopefully when the project is completed, it will provide a broad framework for organizing the ethnographic data pertinent to the parks, indicate promising research avenues and identify lacunae in the available data to focus future studies.   One of the potentially most productive sources for ethnographic data pertaining to parklands in northwestern Alaska is ""Inupiat Ilitqusiat"", occasionally referred to as ""the Spirit Movement.""  The purpose of Inupiat Ilitqusiat is cultural revitalization, the celebration of Inupiat Heritage.  Funded coordinators for this program are employed by NANA, the Northwest Arctic Borough (NAB), the school district, the regional Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) Council, and Maniilaq.  If the NPS works cooperatively with Inupiat Ilitqusiat in identifying and investigating areas of common interest, duplicative efforts will be avoided and resources (personnel and funds) will be used most efficiently.    Discussion     As one of the longest undisturbed and protected river drainages in the world, NOAT will be the focus of a great deal of research in climate and environment over the next decades.  Adding an archeological database to this research will greatly enhance the understanding of anthrogenic changes.  This area has also seen many changes over the last 10,000 years that the archeological record would highlight.  Only a minor part of the preserve has had an inventory done on it so there is a continuing need for comprehensive survey, inventory, and evaluation.

International Hunter Education Association Mission                    To provide leadership, and establish standards in the development of       hunters to be safe, responsible, knowledgeable and involved.               The International Hunter Education Association is an organization involving       thousands of dedicated instructors across the country, plus cooperators in       the shooting sports industry, conservation organizations, advisors and 63       State and Provincial Hunter Education Administrators in Canada, Mexico and       the United States which make up the I.H.E.A.               IHEA is affiliated with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife       Agencies, and its goals are many. Since its inception, IHEA has endeavored       to:                Serve as the primary resource       for information on hunter education;                 Promote hunter education by       providing opportunities for the exchange of ideas, knowledge and experiences;                 Promote hunter education by       fostering cooperative efforts between government agencies, organized groups       and             industry;                 Uphold the image of hunting       as a legitimate tool of wildlife management, and as a recreational activity       throughout North America;                 Promote programs which prevent       hunting accidents;                 Cultivate honesty, self-discipline,       self-reliance, responsible behavior and good citizenship among hunters;                 Promote uniformity in hunter       education requirements and the reciprocal recognition of properly trained       hunters;                 Strive for constant improvement       in hunter education programs;                 Fully involve volunteers and       other associate members in all affairs of the International Hunter Education                                      Association.          The International Hunter Education Association (IHEA) is the international organization comprised of officials having responsibility for administering the various state and provincial hunter education programs in Canada, Mexico and the United States.   The mission of the IHEA is to provide leadership in developing safe, responsible, knowledgeable and involved hunters. The IHEA is recognized as the primary source of information on hunter education and hunting accident statistics. The IHEA provides a medium for exchange of views and experiences that enable hunter education administrators and others to adapt to meet the changing needs of hunters and hunter education. The IHEA is actively involved with other organizations having similar interests and goals to strengthen relationships, build credibility and work to assure that sport hunting has a sound future.   The IHEA is the only organization consolidating data on hunting accidents throughout North America. For the purpose of this report, the IHEA accident definitions are used. Individual states and provincial accident reporting regulations and definitions are different; therefore, the IHEA provides standardized hunting accident definitions and a standardized hunting accident report form.   For the purpose of this report, a hunting accident is defined as “Any event, which is attributed directly or indirectly to a firearm or bow, and causes the injury or death to any person or persons as a result of a person’s actions while hunting.” These accidents are itemized in Sections 2-5 of each State, Provincial and Region report and summarized in the graphs in this report. Activities such as target shooting, plinking, horseplay (while not hunting), or even cleaning a gun are not classified as hunting accidents. These are non-hunting accidents which are formally defined as “Any incident involving a firearm or bow which occurs while engaged in non-hunting activity.” These non-hunting accidents, when reported, are summarized only in Section 9 of the State, Provincial and Region reports.   This Annual Hunter Accident Report is a descriptive study designed to provide data related to hunting injuries in a reasonably standardized form. Data collection and presentation does not take into consideration such variables as state or provincial hunting regulations, differences in topography and ground cover, length of seasons, compliance with regulations, and other differences between states, provinces and regions. Therefore, use of this data in cause and effect studies is inappropriate.   The use of this data in cause and effect studies within a state may be appropriate provided proper definition and control of variables is built into the study. In any case, generalization of findings would be limited to the state in which the study was conducted.   The International Hunter Education Association invites your comments on this report.

Home Page: http://www.ihea.com        1997 Hunting Accident Summary   Hunting Safe and Getting Safer           As the table below indicates, the hunting accident rate is lower than most outdoor activities. Obviously, there is a risk of injury in every outdoor activity. When compared to hunting however, some activities are much more hazardous than most people realize. For example, look at the following list of outdoor activities and compare the number of accidents for these activities with those for hunting.             (These statistics were provided by the National Safety Council,       Statistics Unit in Chicago for 1995 for the U.S. If you are interested in       additional numbers, they can be contacted at 1-800-621-7615 extension 2365.       The numbers for hunting are from 1997 and do not include numbers from Canada.)               Outdoor Activity       Deaths               Boating       836               Hang Gliding       28               Sky Diving       28               Football       4               Personal Watercraft       79               Hunting       96               Scuba Diving       97               Swimming       1,700          Even with such an outstanding safety record, the fact that people may become injured as a result of hunting accidents cannot be ignored. State and Provincial hunter education programs are designed to reduce this number as much as possible. The tools at hand to accomplish this goal are found within our hunter education program and where necessary, within changes in our laws to enhance safety.   Hunter education programs include a variety of educational techniques such as: classroom lectures, demonstrations, films, firearms handling, and, live firing of firearms. Most students receive field simulation training for hands-on experience whenever a shooting range is not available. Even with all of this training, the student still needs additional tutoring from an experienced hunter. Regrettably, some accidents will never be avoided because some participants of sport hunting will act carelessly despite any of the valuable lessons they have learned.   An important question to be answered is ""How does one prevent becoming a victim of a hunting accident?"". Since the most common type of hunting accident involves the victim not being seen by the shooter, the best course of action is to be seen by wearing blaze orange clothing. During the past ten years the bulk of the accidents are vision related accidents.    Vision related accidents are caused by the following factors:     The victim moved into the shooter's line of fire.    The victim was covered by the shooter who was swinging on game.    The victim was out of sight of the shooter.    The victim was mistaken for game.              The use of blaze or hunter orange has been shown       to reduce vision related accidents in states that require its use. The use       of blaze orange clothing could decrease the number of vision related accidents       even further. Its continued use is recommend for all hunting activity except       possibly for migratory bird hunting. In most cases, the number of accidents       could be reduced by over 50 percent if vision related accidents could be       eliminated.            Self-inflicted injuries are the second most common cause of hunting accidents. These accidents are caused by improperly handling a loaded firearm in some manner. Almost 33% of all hunting accidents were self-inflicted.   One of the goals of our Hunter Education Programs is to reduce hunting accidents. Although, the number of people killed as a result of hunting accidents is low compared to most forms of outdoor recreation, we must not lose sight of the fact that people do become injured as a result of hunting accidents. To reduce the number of accidents, we must focus on two factors. The first is to reduce the number of vision related accidents by stressing the importance of wearing blaze orange clothing and to support legislation and regulatory changes to require its use. The second is to reduce the number of self inflicted accidents. We must work to eliminate carelessness while handling hunting firearms and archery equipment alike through hands on training, with an emphasis on safe handling handguns in all situations and long guns in and around vehicles. Responsible hunters realize that caution must be used when they are in the field. A hunter cannot afford even one second of carelessness. The bullet or shot pellets cannot be called back after the trigger has been pulled. By being extra cautious a hunter may be able to reduce the chance of becoming a statistic and continue to be a part of the thousands of hunters who took to the field last year without being involved in a hunting accident.

Reports were not received from Alaska, Alberta, Mexico, British Columbia, Northwest Territories or the Yukon.   There was a decrease in the number of accidents; from 1048 in 1996 to 1038 in 1997 to including a small increases in fatalities in two-party accidents, 58 in 1996 compared to 66 for 1997. There was an increase in fatal two-party rifle accidents as well, 33 in 1996 versus 40 in 1997. Archery accidents continue to decrease in number with the continuing expansion of the archery training program. With the increasing number of training classes becoming available for muzzle loader hunters, the accident trend for this activity showed a minor decrease in 1997. This years numbers were down from 31 to 30. We hope to see this trend for muzzle loader hunters continue to decline as more hunters take muzzle loader training.

The International Hunter Education Association is an organization involving       thousands of dedicated instructors across the country, plus cooperators in       the shooting sports industry, conservation organizations, advisors and 63       State and Provincial Hunter Education Administrators in Canada, Mexico and       the United States which make up the I.H.E.A.               IHEA is affiliated with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife       Agencies, and its goals are many. Since its inception, IHEA has endeavored       to:                Serve as the primary resource       for information on hunter education;                 Promote hunter education by       providing opportunities for the exchange of ideas, knowledge and experiences;                 Promote hunter education by       fostering cooperative efforts between government agencies, organized groups       and             industry;                 Uphold the image of hunting       as a legitimate tool of wildlife management, and as a recreational activity       throughout           North America;                 Promote programs which prevent       hunting accidents;                 Cultivate honesty, self-discipline,       self-reliance, responsible behavior and good citizenship among hunters;                 Promote uniformity in hunter       education requirements and the reciprocal recognition of properly trained       hunters;                 Strive for constant improvement       in hunter education programs;                 Fully involve volunteers and       other associate members in all affairs of the International Hunter Education                                      Association.          The International Hunter Education Association (IHEA) is the international organization comprised of officials having responsibility for administering the various state and provincial hunter education programs in Canada, Mexico and the United States.   The mission of the IHEA is to provide leadership in developing safe, responsible, knowledgeable and involved hunters. The IHEA is recognized as the primary source of information on hunter education and hunting accident statistics. The IHEA provides a medium for exchange of views and experiences that enable hunter education administrators and others to adapt to meet the changing needs of hunters and hunter education. The IHEA is actively involved with other organizations having similar interests and goals to strengthen relationships, build credibility and work to assure that sport hunting has a sound future.   The IHEA is the only organization consolidating data on hunting accidents throughout North America. For the purpose of this report, the IHEA accident definitions are used. Individual states and provincial accident reporting regulations and definitions are different; therefore, the IHEA provides standardized hunting accident definitions and a standardized hunting accident report form.   For the purpose of this report, a hunting accident is defined as “Any event, which is attributed directly or indirectly to a firearm or bow, and causes the injury or death to any person or persons as a result of a person’s actions while hunting.” These accidents are itemized in Sections 2-5 of each State, Provincial and Region report and summarized in the graphs in this report. Activities such as target shooting, plinking, horseplay (while not hunting), or even cleaning a gun are not classified as hunting accidents. These are non-hunting accidents which are formally defined as “Any incident involving a firearm or bow which occurs while engaged in non-hunting activity.” These non-hunting accidents, when reported, are summarized only in Section 9 of the State, Provincial and Region reports.   This Annual Hunter Accident Report is a descriptive study designed to provide data related to hunting injuries in a reasonably standardized form. Data collection and presentation does not take into consideration such variables as state or provincial hunting regulations, differences in topography and ground cover, length of seasons, compliance with regulations, and other differences between states, provinces and regions. Therefore, use of this data in cause and effect studies is inappropriate.   The use of this data in cause and effect studies within a state may be appropriate provided proper definition and control of variables is built into the study. In any case, generalization of findings would be limited to the state in which the study was conducted.   The International Hunter Education Association invites your comments on this report.

Home Page: http://www.fortnet.org/~ihea/        1996 Hunting Accident Summary   Hunting Safe and Getting Safer           As the table below indicates, the hunting accident rate is lower than most outdoor activities. Obviously, there is a risk of injury in every outdoor activity. When compared to hunting however, some activities are much more hazardous than most people realize. For example, look at the following list of outdoor activities and compare the number of accidents for these activities with those for hunting.             (These statistics were provided by the National Safety Council,       Statistics Unit in Chicago for 1995 for the U.S. If you are interested in       additional numbers, they can be contacted at 1-800-621-7615 extension 2365.       The numbers for hunting are from 1996 and do not include numbers from Canada.)               Outdoor Activity       Deaths               Boating       836               Hang Gliding       28               Sky Diving       28               Football       4               Personal Watercraft       79               Hunting       87               Scuba Diving       97               Swimming       1,700          Even with such an outstanding safety record, the fact that people may become injured as a result of hunting accidents cannot be ignored. State and Provincial hunter education programs are designed to reduce this number as much as possible. The tools at hand to accomplish this goal are found within our hunter education program and where necessary, within changes in our laws to enhance safety.   Hunter education programs include a variety of educational techniques such as: classroom lectures, demonstrations, films, firearms handling, and, live firing of firearms. Most students receive field simulation training for hands-on experience whenever a shooting range is not available. Even with all of this training, the student still needs additional tutoring from an experienced hunter. Regrettably, some accidents will never be avoided because some participants of sport hunting will act carelessly despite any of the valuable lessons they have learned.   An important question to be answered is ""How does one prevent becoming a victim of a hunting accident?"". Since the most common type of hunting accident involves the victim not being seen by the shooter, the best course of action is to be seen by wearing blaze orange clothing. During the past ten years the bulk of the accidents are vision related accidents.    Vision related accidents are caused by the following factors:     The victim moved into the shooter's line of fire.    The victim was covered by the shooter who was swinging on game.    The victim was out of sight of the shooter.    The victim was mistaken for game.              The use of blaze or hunter orange has been shown       to reduce vision related accidents in states that require its use. The use       of blaze orange clothing could decrease the number of vision related accidents       even further. Its continued use is recommend for all hunting activity except       possibly for migratory bird hunting. In most cases, the number of accidents       could be reduced by over 50 percent if vision related accidents could be       eliminated.            Self-inflicted injuries are the second most common cause of hunting accidents. These accidents are caused by improperly handling a loaded firearm in some manner. Almost 33% of all hunting accidents were self-inflicted.   One of the goals of our Hunter Education Programs is to reduce hunting accidents. Although, the number of people killed as a result of hunting accidents is low compared to most forms of outdoor recreation, we must not lose sight of the fact that people do become injured as a result of hunting accidents. To reduce the number of accidents, we must focus on two factors. The first is to reduce the number of vision related accidents by stressing the importance of wearing blaze orange clothing and to support legislation and regulatory changes to require its use. The second is to reduce the number of self inflicted accidents. We must work to eliminate carelessness while handling hunting firearms and archery equipment alike through hands on training, with an emphasis on safe handling handguns in all situations and long guns in and around vehicles. Responsible hunters realize that caution must be used when they are in the field. A hunter cannot afford even one second of carelessness. The bullet or shot pellets cannot be called back after the trigger has been pulled. By being extra cautious a hunter may be able to reduce the chance of becoming a statistic and continue to be a part of the thousands of hunters who took to the field last year without being involved in a hunting accident.

Reports were not received from Alaska, Alberta, Mexico, British Columbia, Northwest Territories or the Yukon.   There was a major decrease in the number of accidents; from 1,242 in 1995 to 1048 in 1996 including a major decreases in fatalities in two-party accidents, 73 in 1995 compared to 58 for 1996. There was a decrease in fatal two-party rifle accidents as well, 36 in 1995 versus 33 in 1996. Archery accidents continue to decrease in number with the continuing expansion of the archery training program. Although there an increasing number of training classes becoming available for muzzle loader hunters, the accident trend for this activity is still showing a major increase in 1996. This years numbers were up by about 15%, from 27 to 31. We hope to see this trend for muzzle loader hunters decrease as more hunters take muzzle loader training.

The International Hunter Education Association is an organization involving       thousands of dedicated instructors across the country, plus cooperators in       the shooting sports industry, conservation organizations, advisors and 63       State and Provincial Hunter Education Administrators in Canada, Mexico and       the United States which make up the I.H.E.A.               IHEA is affiliated with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife       Agencies, and its goals are many. Since its inception, IHEA has endeavored       to:                Serve as the primary resource       for information on hunter education;                 Promote hunter education by       providing opportunities for the exchange of ideas, knowledge and experiences;                 Promote hunter education by       fostering cooperative efforts between government agencies, organized groups       and industry;                 Uphold the image of hunting       as a legitimate tool of wildlife management, and as a recreational activity       throughout North America;                 Promote programs which prevent       hunting casualties;                 Cultivate honesty, self-discipline,       self-reliance, responsible behavior and good citizenship among hunters;                 Promote uniformity in hunter       education requirements and the reciprocal recognition of properly trained       hunters;                 Strive for constant improvement       in hunter education programs;                 Fully involve volunteers and       other associate members in all affairs of the International Hunter Education       Association.          The International Hunter Education Association (IHEA) is the international organization comprised of officials having responsibility for administering the various state and provincial hunter education programs in Canada, Mexico and the United States.   The mission of the IHEA is to provide leadership in developing safe, responsible, knowledgeable and involved hunters. The IHEA is recognized as the primary source of information on hunter education and hunting casualty statistics. The IHEA provides a medium for exchange of views and experiences that enable hunter education administrators and others to adapt to meet the changing needs of hunters and hunter education. The IHEA is actively involved with other organizations having similar interests and goals to strengthen relationships, build credibility and work to assure that sport hunting has a sound future.   The IHEA is the only organization consolidating data on hunting casualties throughout North America. For the purpose of this report, the IHEA casualty definitions are used. Individual states and provincial casualty reporting regulations and definitions are different; therefore, the IHEA provides standardized hunting casualty definitions and a standardized hunting casualty report form.   For the purpose of this report, a hunting casualty is defined as “Any event, which is attributed directly or indirectly to a firearm or bow, and causes the injury or death to any person or persons as a result of a person’s actions while hunting.” These casualties are itemized in Sections 2-5 of each State, Provincial and Region report and summarized in the graphs in this report. Activities such as target shooting, plinking, horseplay (while not hunting), or even cleaning a gun are not classified as hunting casualties. These are non-hunting casualties which are formally defined as “Any incident involving a firearm or bow which occurs while engaged in non-hunting activity.” These non-hunting casualties, when reported, are summarized only in Section 9 of the State, Provincial and Region reports.   This Annual Hunter Casualty Report is a descriptive study designed to provide data related to hunting injuries in a reasonably standardized form. Data collection and presentation does not take into consideration such variables as state or provincial hunting regulations, differences in topography and ground cover, length of seasons, compliance with regulations, and other differences between states, provinces and regions. Therefore, use of this data in cause and effect studies is inappropriate.   The use of this data in cause and effect studies within a state may be appropriate provided proper definition and control of variables is built into the study. In any case, generalization of findings would be limited to the state in which the study was conducted.   The International Hunter Education Association invites your comments on this report.

Home Page: http://www.ihea.com        1998 Hunting Casualty Summary   Hunting Safe and Getting Safer           As the table below indicates, the hunting casualty rate is lower than most outdoor activities. Obviously, there is a risk of injury in every outdoor activity. When compared to hunting however, some activities are much more hazardous than most people realize. For example, look at the following list of outdoor activities and compare the number of casualtys for these activities with those for hunting.             (These statistics were provided by the National Safety Council,       Statistics Unit in Chicago for 1995 for the U.S. If you are interested in       additional numbers, they can be contacted at 1-800-621-7615 extension 2365.       The numbers for hunting are from 1998 and do not include numbers from Canada.)               Outdoor Activity       Deaths               Boating       836               Hang Gliding       28               Sky Diving       28               Football       4               Personal Watercraft       79               Hunting       92               Scuba Diving       97               Swimming       1,700          Even with such an outstanding safety record, the fact that people may become injured as a result of hunting casualties cannot be ignored. State and Provincial hunter education programs are designed to reduce this number as much as possible. The tools at hand to accomplish this goal are found within our hunter education program and where necessary, within changes in our laws to enhance safety.   Hunter education programs include a variety of educational techniques such as: classroom lectures, demonstrations, films, firearms handling, and, live firing of firearms. Most students receive field simulation training for hands-on experience whenever a shooting range is not available. Even with all of this training, the student still needs additional tutoring from an experienced hunter. Regrettably, some casualties will never be avoided because some participants of sport hunting will act carelessly despite any of the valuable lessons they have learned.   An important question to be answered is ""How does one prevent becoming a victim of a hunting accident?"". Since the most common type of hunting accident involves the victim not being seen by the shooter, the best course of action is to be seen by wearing blaze orange clothing. During the past ten years the bulk of the casualties are vision related casualties.    Vision related casualties are caused by the following factors:     The victim moved into the shooter's line of fire.    The victim was covered by the shooter who was swinging on game.    The victim was out of sight of the shooter.    The victim was mistaken for game (failure to identify target).              The use of blaze or hunter orange has been shown       to reduce vision related casualties in states that require its use. The use       of blaze orange clothing could decrease the number of vision related casualties       even further. Its continued use is recommend for all hunting activity except       possibly for migratory bird hunting. In most cases, the number of casualties       could be reduced by over 50 percent if vision related casualties could be       eliminated.            Self-inflicted injuries are the second most common cause of hunting casualties. These casualties are caused by improperly handling a loaded firearm in some manner. Almost 33% of all hunting casualties were self-inflicted.   One of the goals of our Hunter Education Programs is to reduce hunting casualties. Although, the number of people killed as a result of hunting casualties is low compared to most forms of outdoor recreation, we must not lose sight of the fact that people do become injured as a result of hunting casualties. To reduce the number of casualties, we must focus on two factors. The first is to reduce the number of vision related casualties by stressing the importance of wearing blaze orange clothing and to support legislation and regulatory changes to require its use. The second is to reduce the number of self inflicted casualties. We must work to eliminate carelessness while handling hunting firearms and archery equipment alike through hands on training, with an emphasis on safe handling handguns in all situations and long guns in and around vehicles. Responsible hunters realize that caution must be used when they are in the field. A hunter cannot afford even one second of carelessness. The bullet or shot pellets cannot be called back after the trigger has been pulled. By being extra cautious a hunter may be able to reduce the chance of becoming a statistic and continue to be a part of the thousands of hunters who took to the field last year without being involved in a hunting accident.

Reports were not received from Alaska, Alberta, Mexico, British Columbia, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Ontario, Prince Edward Island or the Yukon.   There was a major decrease in the number of casualties; from 1038 in 1997 to 987 in 1998 although a minimal change in the number of fatalities in two-party casualties, 66 in 1997 compared to 65 for 1998. There was a decrease in fatal two-party rifle casualties, 40 in 1997 versus 35 in 1998. Archery casualties continue to decrease in number with the continuing expansion of the archery training program. There are an increasing number of training classes becoming available for muzzle loader hunters and for the first time, the number of casualties decreased dramatically.  This year's numbers were down, from 30 to 23. We hope to see this trend for muzzle loader hunters downward as more hunters take muzzle loader training.

ACTION:  Emergency rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY:  We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), exercise our  authority to emergency list the Santa Barbara County Distinct  Vertebrate Population Segment (DPS) of California tiger salamander  (Ambystoma californiense), as endangered under the Endangered Species  Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Of 14 documented breeding sites and  associated uplands, half have been destroyed or have suffered severe  degradation in the last 18 months. Plans to convert additional sites  from grazing to intensive agriculture are being developed and  implemented. Because these losses and planned conversions constitute an  emergency posing a significant and imminent risk to the well-being of  the Santa Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander, we  find that emergency listing is necessary. This emergency rule provides  Federal protection pursuant to the Act for a period of 240 days. A  proposed rule to list the Santa Barbara County DPS of the California  tiger salamander is published concurrently with this emergency rule, in  this same issue of the Federal Register in the proposed rule section.  DATES:  This emergency rule becomes effective January 19, 2000 and  expires September 15, 2000.  ADDRESSES:  The complete file for this rule is available for  inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service, Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office, 2493  Portola Road, Suite B, Ventura, California, 93003.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Grace McLaughlin or Carl Benz,  Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office, at the address listed above  (telephone: 805/644-1766; facsimile: 805/644-3958).  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Background      The California tiger salamander was first described as a distinct  species, Ambystoma californiense, by Gray in 1853 from specimens  collected in Monterey (Grinnell and Camp 1917). Storer (1925) and  Bishop (1943) likewise considered the California tiger salamander as a  distinct species. However, Dunn (1940), Gehlbach (1967), and Frost  (1985) considered the California tiger salamander a subspecies  (Ambystoma tigrinum californiense) that belonged within the A. tigrinum  complex. Based on recent morphological and genetic work, geographic  isolation, and ecological differences among the members of the A.  tigrinum complex, the California tiger salamander is considered to be a  distinct species (Shaffer and Stanley 1991; Jones 1993; Shaffer and  McKnight 1996; Irschick and Shaffer 1997). The California tiger  salamander was recognized as a distinct species in the November 21,  1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804).     The California tiger salamander is a large, stocky, terrestrial  salamander with a broad, rounded snout. Adults may reach a total length  of 207 millimeters (mm) (8.2 inches (in)), with males generally  averaging about 200 mm (8 in) in total length and females averaging  about 170 mm (6.8 in) in total length. For both sexes, the average  snout-vent length is approximately 90 mm (3.6 in). The small eyes have  black irises and protrude from the head. Coloration consists of white  or pale yellow spots or bars on a black background on the back and  sides. The belly varies from almost uniform white or pale yellow to a  variegated pattern of white or pale yellow and black. Males can be  distinguished from females, especially during the breeding season, by  their swollen cloacae (a common chamber into which the intestinal,  urinary, and reproductive canals discharge), more developed tail fins,  and larger overall size (Stebbins 1962; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996).     California tiger salamanders are restricted to California, and  their range does not overlap with any other species of tiger salamander  (Stebbins 1985). Within California, the Santa Barbara County population  is separated by the Coast Ranges, particularly the La Panza and Sierra  Madre Ranges, and the Carrizo Plain from the closest other population,  which extends into the Temblor Range in eastern San Luis Obispo and  western Kern Counties (Shaffer, et al. 1993).     The California tiger salamander inhabited low elevation, below 300  meters (m) (1000 feet (ft)), vernal pools and seasonal ponds and the  associated coastal scrub, grassland, and oak savannah plant communities  of the Santa Maria, Los Alamos, and Santa Rita Valleys in western Santa  Barbara County (Shaffer, et al. 1993; Sam Sweet, University of  California, Santa Barbara, in litt. 1993, 1998a). Although California  tiger salamanders still exist across most of their historic range in  Santa Barbara County, the habitat available to them has been reduced  greatly. The ponds available to the salamanders for breeding have been  degraded and reduced in number and the associated upland habitats  inhabited by salamanders for most of their life cycle have been  degraded and reduced in area through changes in agriculture practices,  urbanization, building of roads and highways, chemical applications,  and overgrazing (Gira et al. 1999; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993, 1998a,b).     Subadult and adult California tiger salamanders spend much of their  lives in small mammal burrows found in the upland component of their  habitat, particularly those of ground squirrels and pocket gophers  (Loredo and Van Vuren 1996, Trenham 1998a). During estivation (a state  of dormancy or inactivity in response to hot, dry weather), California  tiger salamanders eat very little (Shaffer, et al. 1993). Once fall and  winter rains begin, they emerge from these retreats on nights of high  relative humidity and during rains to feed and to migrate to the  breeding ponds (Stebbins 1985, 1989; Shaffer, et al. 1993). The  salamanders breeding in and living around a pool or seasonal ponds,  constitute a local subpopulation. The rate of natural movement of  salamanders among subpopulations depends on the distance between the  ponds or complexes and on the intervening habitat (e.g., salamanders  may move more quickly through sparsely covered and more open grassland  versus more densely vegetated scrublands).     Adults may migrate up to 2 kilometers (km) (1.2 miles (mi)) from  summering to breeding sites. The distance from breeding sites may  depend on local topography and vegetation, the distribution of ground  squirrel or other rodent burrows, and climatic conditions (Stebbins  1989, Hunt 1998). In Santa Barbara County, juvenile California tiger  salamanders have been trapped over 360 m (1,200 ft) while dispersing  from their natal (birth) pond (Ted Mullen, Science Applications  International Corporation (SAIC), personal communication, 1998), and  adults have been found along roads over 2 km (1.2 mi) from breeding  ponds (S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a). Migration is concentrated during a  few rainy nights early in the winter, with males migrating before  females (Twitty 1941; Shaffer, et al. 1993; Loredo and Van Vuren 1996;  Trenham 1998b). Males  [[Page 3097]]  usually remain in the ponds for an average of about 6 to 8 weeks, while  females stay for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. In dry years, both sexes  may stay for shorter periods (Loredo and Van Vuren 1996, Trenham  1998b). Although most marked salamanders have been recaptured at the  pond where they were initially captured, in one study approximately 20  percent were recaptured at different ponds (Trenham 1998b). As with  migration distances, the number of ponds used by an individual over its  lifetime will be dependent on landscape features.     Female California tiger salamanders mate and lay their eggs singly  or in small groups (Twitty 1941; Shaffer, et al. 1993). The number of  eggs laid by a single female ranges from approximately 400 to 1,300 per  breeding season (Trenham 1998b). The eggs typically are attached to  vegetation near the edge of the breeding pond (Storer 1925, Twitty  1941), but in ponds with no or limited vegetation, they may be attached  to objects (rocks, boards, etc.) on the bottom (Jennings and Hayes  1994). After breeding, adults leave the pond and typically return to  small mammal burrows (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a), although they  may continue to come out nightly for approximately the next 2 weeks to  feed (Shaffer, et al. 1993).     Eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days with newly hatched larvae ranging from  11.5 to 14.2 mm (0.45 to 0.56 in) in total length. Larvae feed on  algae, small crustaceans, and mosquito larvae for about 6 weeks after  hatching, when they switch to larger prey (P.R. Anderson 1968). Larger  larvae have been known to consume smaller tadpoles of Pacific treefrogs  (Hyla regilla) and California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) as well as  many aquatic insects and other aquatic invertebrates (J.D. Anderson  1968; P.R. Anderson 1968). Captive salamanders appear to locate food by  vision and olfaction (smell) (J.D. Anderson 1968).     Amphibian larvae must grow to a critical minimum body size before  they can metamorphose (change into a different physical form) to the  terrestrial stage (Wilbur and Collins 1973). Feaver (1971) found that  California tiger salamander larvae metamorphosed and left the breeding  ponds 60 to 94 days after the eggs had been laid, with larvae  developing faster in smaller, more rapidly drying ponds. The longer the  ponding duration, the larger the larvae and metamorphosed juveniles are  able to grow. The larger juvenile amphibians grow, the more likely they  are to survive and reproduce (Semlitsch et al. 1988; Morey 1998).     In the late spring or early summer, before the ponds dry  completely, metamorphosed juveniles leave the ponds and enter small  mammal burrows after spending up to a few days in mud cracks or tunnels  in moist soil near the water (Zeiner et al. 1988; Shaffer, et al. 1993;  Loredo et al. 1996). Like the adults, juveniles may emerge from these  retreats to feed during nights of high relative humidity (Storer 1925;  Shaffer, et al. 1993) before settling in their selected estivation  sites for the dry summer months.     Many of the pools in which California tiger salamanders lay eggs do  not retain water long enough to support successful metamorphosis.  Generally, 10 weeks is required to allow sufficient time to  metamorphose. The larvae will desiccate (dry out and perish) if a site  dries before larvae complete metamorphosis (P.R. Anderson 1968, Feaver  1971). Pechmann et al. (1989) found a strong positive correlation with  ponding duration and total number of metamorphosing juveniles in five  salamander species. In one study, successful metamorphosis of  California tiger salamanders occurred only in larger pools with longer  ponding durations (Feaver 1971), which is typical range-wide (Jennings  and Hayes 1994). Even though there is little difference in the number  of pools used by salamanders between wet and dry years, pool duration  is the most important factor to consider in relation to persistence and  survival (Feaver 1971; Shaffer, et al. 1993; Seymour and Westphal 1994,  1995).     Lifetime reproductive success for California and other tiger  salamanders is typically low, with fewer than 30 metamorphic juveniles  per breeding female. While individuals may survive for more than 10  years, many may breed only once, and, in some populations, less than 5  percent of marked juveniles survive to become breeding adults (Trenham  1998b). With such low recruitment, isolated subpopulations can decline  greatly from unusual, randomly occurring natural events as well as from  human-caused factors that reduce breeding success and individual  survival. Factors that repeatedly lower breeding success in isolated  ponds that are too far from other ponds for migrating individuals to  replenish the population can quickly drive a local population to  extinction.  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segment      The evidence supports recognition of Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamanders as a DPS for purposes of listing, as  defined in our February 7, 1996, Policy Regarding the Recognition of  Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments (61 FR 4722). The definition of  ``species'' in section 3(16) of the Act includes ``any distinct  population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which  interbreeds when mature.'' When listing a population under the Act as a  DPS, three elements are considered: (1) The discreteness of the  population segment in relation to the remainder of the species to which  it belongs; (2) the significance of the population segment to the  species to which it belongs; and (3) the population segment's  conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing  (i.e., is the population segment, when treated as if it were a species,  endangered or threatened?) (61 FR 4722).     The DPS of California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County is  discrete in relation to the remainder of the species as a whole. The  DPS is geographically isolated and separate from other California tiger  salamanders; no mixing of the population with other California tiger  salamander populations occurs. As detailed below, this finding is  supported by an evaluation of the species' genetic variability.     Genetic analyses of the California tiger salamander suggest that  levels of interchange among populations are very low, and that  populations or subpopulations are genetically isolated from one another  (Jones 1993; Shaffer, et al. 1993). Allozyme variation (distinct types  of enzymes (proteins) in the cells, which are formed from an  individual's inherited genes) and mitochondrial DNA sequence data  indicate the existence of at least seven genetically distinct  California tiger salamander populations (Shaffer, et al. 1993).  Although the allozyme variation reported by Shaffer, et al. (1993) is  quite low, it does indicate patterns of geographic isolation. Probably  because of this isolation, the population in Santa Barbara County is  one of the two most genetically distinct, and these salamanders are  more similar to California tiger salamanders on the eastern side of the  Central Valley than to those in the closest populations found in the  Temblor Range (Shaffer, et al. 1993). The populations in the Temblor  Range are about 67.5 km or 44 mi by air, from the Santa Barbara County  population, while the eastern Central Valley populations are 200 km or  128 mi by air, across mountain ranges, an arid plain, and the Central  Valley, all of which are inhospitable zones for California tiger  salamanders. The Santa Barbara County population may be a relict  population of a much more widespread group that extended across the  area where the Tehachapi and  [[Page 3098]]  Transverse Ranges now extend. The uplift of those ranges changed the  terrain and the local climatic conditions, isolating salamanders in  what is now northwestern Santa Barbara County. The Temblor Range  salamanders appear to be a more recent extension from the populations  south of San Francisco Bay. The sequence divergence between the Santa  Barbara County tiger salamanders and other samples from throughout the  species' range is on the order of 1.7 percent (Shaffer, in litt. 1998)  or 1.8 percent (Shaffer, et. al. 1993). Shaffer's mitochondrial DNA  sequence data (Shaffer and McKnight 1996, and unpublished data) suggest  that the seven distinct populations differ markedly in their genetic  characteristics, with Santa Barbara County tiger salamanders having  gene sequences not found in any other California tiger salamander  populations (Shaffer, in litt. 1998). California tiger salamanders in  Santa Barbara County may have been separated from the other populations  for about 1 to 1.5 million years (Shaffer, et al. 1993; Shaffer and  McKnight 1996; H. Bradley Shaffer, University of California, Davis  (UCD), in litt. 1998). Shaffer, et al. (1993) and Shaffer (in litt.  1998) suggest that differentiation at this level is sufficient to  justify species-level recognition.     The Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander population is  biologically and ecologically significant to the species. As discussed  above, the Santa Barbara County population is genetically distinct from  other populations of California tiger salamanders, and individuals  exhibit genetic characteristics not found in other California tiger  salamanders. The Santa Barbara County population is also significant in  that it constitutes the only population of California tiger salamanders  west of the outer Coast Ranges, and it is the southernmost population  of the species. The DPS covered in this emergency rule is found only in  Santa Barbara County. The extinction of the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander population would result in the loss of a  significant genetic entity, the curtailment of the range of the species  as a whole, and the loss of a top predator in the aquatic systems that  Santa Barbara County California tiger salamanders inhabit. Based on  geographic isolation, the lack of evidence of gene flow with other  populations, and marked genetic differentiation, we conclude that the  Santa Barbara County population of California tiger salamanders meets  the discreteness and significance criteria in our Policy Regarding the  Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments and qualifies as  a DPS. We discuss the Santa Barbara County population's conservation  status below.  Status and Distribution      Currently, California tiger salamanders in Santa Barbara County are  found in four discrete regions (S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a).  Collectively, salamanders in these regions constitute a single genetic  population or DPS, reproductively separate from the rest of the  California tiger salamanders (Jones 1993; Shaffer, et al. 1993; Shaffer  and McKnight 1996). Ponds and associated uplands in southwestern (West  Orcutt) and southeastern (Bradley-Dominion) Santa Maria Valley, Los  Alamos Valley, and Santa Rita Valley constitute the four discrete  regions or metapopulations where California tiger salamanders now exist  in Santa Barbara County (S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a). For the purposes of  this rule, a metapopulation is defined as a group of subpopulations or  ``local populations'' linked by genetic exchange. Of 14 known breeding  sites or subpopulations within this DPS, 1 was destroyed in 1998, the  upland habitat around 3 has been converted into more intensive  agriculture practices (i.e. vineyards, gladiolus fields, and row crops,  which may have eliminated the salamander subpopulations), 1 is  surrounded by agriculture and urban development, 2 are affected by  overgrazing, 4 are imminently threatened with conversion to vineyards  or other intensive agriculture practices, and the remaining 3 are in  areas rapidly undergoing conversion to vineyards and row crops (Sweet,  et al. 1998; Sweet, in litt. 1998; Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development 1998; Grace McLaughlin, Service, personal observations,  1998). Thus, only 6 or 7 of 13 existing ponds potentially provide  breeding habitat for viable subpopulations of Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamanders. Although other breeding ponds could exist  within each of the four metapopulations noted above, searches around  extant localities in the county, as well as in other areas with  suitable habitat, have not identified additional subpopulations of the  species (Paul Collins, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, in  litt. 1998, pers. comm. 1999; S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a). Four possible  breeding ponds or pond complexes (three in the Bradley-Dominion area,  one in Santa Rita Valley) have been identified from aerial photography  and by finding salamanders on roads in the vicinity (Sweet, et al.  1998) but have not been sampled. Most of the upland habitats around the  ponds have been converted to vineyards or row crops within the last 6  years (Santa Barbara County Planning and Development 1998). All of the  known and potential localities of the California tiger salamander in  Santa Barbara County are on private lands, none are protected by  conservation easements or agreements, and access is limited.  Previous Federal Action      On September 18, 1985, we published the Vertebrate Notice of Review  (50 FR 37958), which included the California tiger salamander as a  category 2 candidate species for possible future listing as threatened  or endangered. Category 2 candidates were those taxa for which  information contained in our files indicated that listing may be  appropriate but for which additional data were needed to support a  listing proposal. The January 6, 1989, and November 21, 1991, candidate  notices of review (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively) also  included the California tiger salamander as a category 2 candidate,  soliciting information on the status of the species. On February 21,  1992, we received a petition from Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer of the  University of California, Davis, to list the California tiger  salamander as an endangered species. We published a 90-day petition  finding on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), concluding that the  petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may  be warranted. On April 18, 1994, we published a 12-month petition  finding (59 FR 18353) that the listing of the California tiger  salamander was warranted but precluded by higher priority listing  actions. We elevated the species to category 1 status at that time,  which was reflected in the November 15, 1994, Animal Notice of Review  (59 FR 58982). Category 1 candidates were those taxa for which we had  on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats  to support preparation of listing proposals. In a memorandum dated  November 3, 1994, from the acting Assistant Regional Director to the  Field Supervisor, the recycled 12-month finding on the petition and a  proposed rule to list the species under the Act were given a due date  of December 15, 1995. However, on April 10, 1995, Public Law 104-6  imposed a moratorium on listings and critical habitat designations and  rescinded $1.5 million from the listing program funding. The moratorium  was lifted and listing funding was restored through passage of the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act on April 26, 1996, following severe  funding constraints  [[Page 3099]]  imposed by a number of continuing resolutions between November 1995 and  April 1996. The listing of the California tiger salamander throughout  its range was precluded by the need to address higher priority species,  although the status of the entire species is currently under review.  The decision to emergency list this DPS of the California tiger  salamander is based on information contained in the original petition,  information referenced in the petition, and new information otherwise  available to the Service.     The processing of this emergency rule conforms with our Listing  Priority Guidance published in the Federal Register on October 22, 1999  (64 FR 57114). The guidance clarifies the order in which we will  process rulemakings. Highest priority is processing emergency listing  rules for any species determined to face a significant and imminent  risk to its well-being (Priority 1). Second priority (Priority 2) is  processing final determinations on proposed additions to the lists of  endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Third priority is  processing new proposals to add species to the lists. The processing of  administrative petition findings (petitions  filed  under section 4 of  the Act) is the fourth priority. The processing of critical habitat  determinations (prudency and determinability decisions) and proposed or  final designations of critical habitat will be funded separately from  other section 4 listing actions and will no longer be subject to  prioritization under the Listing Priority Guidance. This emergency rule  is a Priority 1 action and is being completed in accordance with the  current Listing Priority Guidance.  Summary of Factors Affecting the Species      After a thorough review and consideration of all information  available, we have determined that the Santa Barbara County population  of the California tiger salamander warrants classification as an   endangered DPS. We followed procedures found at section 4 of the Act  (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to  implement the listing provisions of the Act. We may determine a species  to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors  described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to  the Santa Barbara County DPS of the California tiger salamander  (Ambystoma californiense) are as follows:  A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment  of Its Habitat or Range      California tiger salamanders now occur in scattered subpopulations  within four isolated areas or metapopulations across the historic range  in Santa Barbara County. Based on the topography and habitat type of  the lands that have been converted to agriculture and urban  development, we conclude that the number of breeding ponds, the extent  of upland habitats, and the quality of the remaining habitats have been  reduced greatly since Europeans first settled the region. While those  areas remained in grazing lands or oil production, which generally have  relatively low effects on the subpopulations, the species was  relatively secure. However, based on aerial photography from the 1930's  through the 1990's (archived at the Santa Barbara County Department of  Planning and Development), the conversion to intensive agriculture and  urban developments has resulted in the loss of breeding habitat from  the destruction or alteration of natural vernal pools and seasonal  ponds, and the loss of upland habitat used for estivation and  migration.     Pools and ponds are destroyed when they are filled during grading  and leveling operations or deep-ripping. Deep-ripping or deep slip  plowing is a technique that uses a 4- to 7-foot deep plow to break up  the hardpan (layer of dense soil or material that prevents water  percolation) or compacted soil to allow water to drain deeper into the  soil and prevents water retention or ponding. Alternatively, seasonal  ponds may be converted to irrigation ponds, which are often managed in  ways that are not conducive to salamander survival (Lawrence Hunt,  Biological Consultant, in litt. 1998). The repeated plowing and discing  or deep-ripping of upland habitats can alter the hydrology of the  pools, thus destroying them (Coe 1988), or can kill salamanders  outright and destroy the small mammal burrow systems in which they live  most of the year.     Intensive agricultural practices began in the Santa Maria River and   San Antonio Creek Valleys over 130 years ago (Elihu Gevirtz, Santa  Barbara County Planning and Development, pers. comm. 1999), probably  eliminating many breeding ponds and associated upland habitats. The  increasingly rapid conversion of these lands and those in the Los  Alamos and Santa Rita Valleys to intensive agricultural practices is  characterized by the increase in row crop acreage by more than 9,900  hectares (ha) (over 25,000 acres (ac)) since 1986 and the installation  of approximately 4,000 ha (10,000 ac) of vineyards just since 1996  (Gira et al. 1999). These conversions have resulted in the destruction  of two breeding ponds (one suspected and one documented) and the  grading of 90 and 100 percent of their drainage basins, and the grading  of 50 to 100 percent of the drainage basins of five documented and two  suspected breeding ponds in the last 5 years (Santa Barbara County  Planning and Development 1998). Six of 14 documented breeding sites and  associated uplands have been destroyed or severely affected since 1996,  and there are proposals to develop vineyards around 4 other documented  breeding ponds, leaving only 4 of 13 remaining pond sites relatively  free from imminent threat (Hunt 1998; G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998;  Santa Barbara County Planning and Development 1998; Sweet, et al. 1998;  Sweet, in litt. 1998). The current and potential threats to the  remaining ponds from agriculture and urbanization are discussed below  by region (West Orcutt, Bradley-Dominion, Los Alamos, Santa Rita).     The known breeding sites in southwestern Santa Maria Valley (west  of Highway 101 and Santa Maria), comprising the West Orcutt  metapopulation, are on grazing and other agricultural lands. Vernal  pools in the area have been lost or adversely affected by rapid  development in the Santa Maria Valley (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999).  Thirty years ago, a housing development directly affected one of three  documented breeding sites in this metapopulation. The two remaining  sites are separated by a railroad that may disrupt migration routes and  reduce genetic interchange. These sites are also threatened by  overgrazing (G. McLaughlin, pers. obs. 1998) (see discussion on grazing  in Factors C and E, below) and potentially threatened by urban  development (S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a; E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999).     Before 1996, the four documented and three possible breeding sites  (Sweet, et al. 1998) in southeastern Santa Maria Valley, which  constitute the Bradley-Dominion metapopulation, were surrounded by oil  production and grazing lands. Since 1996, agricultural land conversion  for vineyards, vegetable row crops, and flowers has destroyed one  documented and one suspected breeding site, possibly extirpated  salamanders from two other documented sites and one possible breeding  site, and threatens the remaining possible breeding site (S. Sweet, in  litt. 1993; 1998a,b). Although  [[Page 3100]]  California tiger salamanders were found migrating across roads in the  vicinity of the possible breeding sites throughout the 1980's,  salamanders have not been observed since the early 1990's, when the  grazing lands were converted to vineyards (S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a).     A storage facility for agricultural products and chemicals is  within the watershed of the remaining documented breeding site (S.  Sweet, in litt. 1998a; Theresa Stevens, Santa Barbara County Planning  and Development, pers. comm. 1999). Although precautions have been  taken to reduce the threats of runoff and spills into the natural pond  (Analise Merlo, Santa Barbara County Planning and Development, pers.  comm. 1999) that could eliminate or injure salamanders during the  breeding or development seasons, the threats still exist. A road  between this pond and a nearby pond, the watershed of which was  converted to gladiolus fields in 1998, disrupts migration between the  ponds and the uplands, has caused the deaths of many salamanders, and  contributes to potentially lethal contamination of the ponds (S. Sweet,  in litt. 1993, 1998a).     The Los Alamos Valley or Las Flores metapopulation, although  fragmented by Highway 101, was considered to be an important breeding  site for the species provided existing conditions could be maintained  (Stebbins 1989). However, recent changes in land ownership and  management have resulted in the conversion from grazing lands to  vineyards, east of the highway. The direct effects of this conversion  resulted in the loss of one vernal pool and the severe degradation of  upland habitats surrounding that pool and another documented breeding  site (Hunt 1998). On the west side of Highway 101, habitat around four  vernal pools and seasonal ponds that are documented breeding sites and  currently grazing lands, may be converted for intensive agricultural  practices (Santa Barbara County Planning and Development 1998; L. Hunt,  in litt. 1999; S. Sweet, in litt. 1998a; Abe Lieder, Santa Barbara  County Planning and Development, in litt. 1999; Morgan Wehtje,  California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), pers. comm. 1999).     In the Santa Rita Valley metapopulation, one of the two sites used  by the California tiger salamander west of Buellton has been severely  affected by agricultural grading and conversion to row crops (S. Sweet,  in litt. 1993, 1998a,b). The other site has two vernal pools that have  been deepened to create a permanent water source for cattle and have  had introductions of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and sunfish  (Lepomis spp.). The pools are adjacent to Highway 246, resulting in  considerable road mortality of salamanders during their breeding  migrations (S. Sweet, in litt. 1993, 1998). Upland habitats around two  possible breeding ponds northeast of the latter were deep-ripped in  1998 in preparation for conversion to vineyards (L. Hunt, in litt.  1998; Santa Barbara County Planning and Development 1998). The  conversion to vineyard of these areas is in progress (G. McLaughlin,  pers. obs. 1999), and one of the ponds has recently been enlarged and  deepened (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999; Jim Mace, U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, pers. comm. 1999). This change may make the pond less  desirable for the California tiger salamander and more likely to be  inhabited by exotic fish, crayfish, and bullfrogs.     Oil production began within the range of the salamander  approximately 100 years ago, with the discovery of oil in the Solomon  Hills (within the range of the Los Alamos tiger salamander  metapopulation). By 1910, production had begun in the Santa Maria  Valley (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999). Although oil production is less  disruptive to the upland habitats than agriculture, oil sump ponds,  particularly those located where natural ponds and pools once existed,  may act as toxic sinks. While attracting salamanders seeking breeding  sites, these ponds may contain levels of contaminants that may kill  adults, eggs, and larvae outright, or cause deformities in the  developing larvae thus precluding their survival (see discussion on  contaminants in Factor E of this section). Also, the ``burping'''  (release) of hydrogen sulfide gas by the wells can acidify the ponds as  the gas settles in low-lying areas, reducing the survival rates of  larvae and adults (S. Sweet, in litt. 1993).     The primary cause of the reduced distribution of the California  tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County is the conversion of native  habitat to intensive agricultural practices and urban development. In  addition, the largest remaining subpopulations are in areas most  severely threatened by human encroachment (Shaffer, et al. 1993; S.  Sweet, in litt. 1993; 1998a; E. Gevirtz, in litt. 1998). Besides direct  loss of habitat, the widespread conversion of land to agricultural and  residential uses has led to the fragmentation of the range of the tiger  salamander and isolation of remaining subpopulations in Santa Barbara  County (Shaffer, et al. 1993; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993; 1998a). Even  relatively minor habitat modifications, such as construction of roads,  pipelines, fences, and berms that traverse the area between breeding  and refuge sites, can increase habitat fragmentation, impede or prevent  breeding migrations, and result in direct and indirect mortality (Mader  1984; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993, 1998; Findlay and Houlahan 1996; Launer  and Fee 1996; Gibbs 1998).  B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  Educational Purposes      Although tiger salamanders have been used for bait and imported  larvae (``waterdogs'') are still sold in California, we have no  information about the use of California tiger salamanders for this  purpose (see discussion under Factor E of this section).  C. Disease or Predation  Disease     The direct effect of disease on the Santa Barbara County population  of California tiger salamanders is not known and the risks to the DPS  have not been determined. Because California tiger salamanders are  found in so few sites in Santa Barbara County, and because the sites  are found across a relatively small area, disease must be considered a  potential threat to the persistence of the DPS. Sam Sweet (pers. comm.  1998) reported that one landowner in the Los Alamos Valley has seen  large numbers of dead and dying salamanders in a pond, but the cause  was not determined. Several pathogenic (disease-causing) agents,  including at least one bacterium (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), a water  mold (fungus) (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997; Lefcort et al. 1997), and  a virus (McLean 1998), have been associated with die-offs of closely  related tiger salamanders, as well as other amphibian species. Each of  these pathogens could devastate one or all of the remaining  subpopulations or metapopulations if introduced into Santa Barbara  County.     Worthylake and Hovingh (1989) reported on repeated die-offs of  tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Desolation Lake in the  Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Affected salamanders had red, swollen hind  legs and vents, and widespread hemorrhage of the skin and internal  organs. The researchers determined that the die-offs were due to  infection with the bacterium Acinetobacter. The number of bacteria in  the lake increased with increasing nitrogen levels as the lake dried.  The nitrogen was believed to come from both atmospheric deposition and  waste from sheep grazing in the watershed (Worthylake and Hovingh  [[Page 3101]]  1989). Acinetobacter spp. are common in soil and animal feces.  Overstocking of livestock in pond watersheds could lead to high levels  of nitrogen in ponds and contribute to increased bacterial levels.     Lefcort et al. (1997), in Georgia, found that tiger salamanders  raised in natural and artificial ponds contaminated with silt were  susceptible to infection by the water mold Saprolegnia parasitica. The  fungus first appeared on the feet, then spread to the entire leg. All  infected animals died. Die-offs of western toads (Bufo boreas),  Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae), and Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla)  also have been associated with Saprolegnia infections (Kiesecker and  Blaustein 1997). Saprolegnia spp. are widespread in natural waters and  commonly grow on dead organic material (Wise 1995).     High nitrogen and silt levels from overgrazing or other  agricultural or urban runoff may increase susceptibility to disease and  may interact with other risk factors (e.g., habitat loss, introduced  species) to jeopardize the persistence of a local population. Two of  the three ponds in the West Orcutt metapopulation area are in severely  overgrazed grasslands and are at risk of receiving runoff that has both  high nitrogen and high silt levels. Four ponds in the Los Alamos  metapopulation and the two ponds in the Santa Rita metapopulation are  on grazing lands; although the levels of grazing are not excessive,  silt and nitrogen levels must be considered when assessing the health  of these populations. One of the ponds in the Los Alamos Valley was the  site of a die-off of California tiger salamanders, but the cause was  unknown (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998).     In addition to the Acinetobacter discussed above, an iridovirus  (viruses with DNA as the genetic material that occur in insects, fish,  and amphibians and may cause death, skin lesions, or no symptoms) has  been identified by the U.S. Geological Service (USGS), National  Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, as the cause of deaths of  large numbers of tiger salamanders at Desolation Lake, Utah. Infected  salamanders moved slowly in circles and had trouble remaining upright.  They had red spots and swollen areas on the skin. Viruses associated  with die-offs of tiger and spotted salamanders in two other States,  Maine and North Dakota, have been isolated (McLean 1998). In 1995,  researchers reported similar die-offs attributed to an iridovirus in  southern Arizona and near Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (McLean 1998).  Iridoviruses are found in both fish and frogs and may have been  introduced to some sites through fish stocking programs. Little is  known about the historical distribution of iridoviruses in salamander  populations. A virus could enter California via bait shops where  eastern tiger salamanders are legally sold in certain counties  (California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 14, Division 1, Subdivision  1, Chapter 2, Article 3, Sec. 4, 1999), or where they are illegally  sold in other areas. The virus may be carried by birds, such as herons  and egrets, that feed on the salamanders. Such a virus could be  devastating to the Santa Barbara County population of California tiger  salamanders.  Predation      Predation and competition by introduced or nonnative species  potentially affect 38 percent of the remaining 13 Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander breeding sites. Shaffer, et al. (1993)  consider bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), mosquitofish, and other  introduced fish to be biological indicators of ponds that have been  disturbed to a degree that California tiger salamanders are excluded.  Competition is discussed under Factor E of this section.     Bullfrogs prey on California tiger salamander larvae (P.R. Anderson  1968). Morey and Guinn (1992) documented a shift in amphibian community  composition at a vernal pool complex, with California tiger salamanders  becoming proportionally less abundant as bullfrogs increased. Although  bullfrogs are unable to establish permanent breeding populations in  unaltered vernal pools and seasonal ponds, dispersing immature frogs  take up residence in vernal pools during winter and spring (Morey and  Guinn 1992) and may prey on native amphibians, including larval  California tiger salamanders. Lawler et al. (1999) found that less than  5 percent of California red-legged frog tadpoles survived to  metamorphosis when raised with bullfrog tadpoles (initially, ponds held  720 red-legged frog tadpoles and 50 bullfrog tadpoles; approximately 50  percent of the bullfrogs successfully metamorphosed). Due to the  documented effects of bullfrogs on other amphibian species, we believe  that they are likely to have similar effects on California tiger  salamanders and that the presence of bullfrogs in salamander habitat  threatens the persistence of the salamander populations. Bullfrogs are  found within 1.6 km (1 mi) of one vernal pool complex in Santa Barbara  County (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1999), posing a threat to that  metapopulation.     Mosquitofish, instead of pesticides, often are placed into ponds by  vector control agencies to eliminate mosquitoes. Mosquitofish are used  by every vector control district in the State and in some districts  represent the majority of their control efforts (Ken Boyce, California  Mosquito and Vector Control Association, in litt. 1994). These fish  were first introduced to California in 1922 and have since become well- established throughout the State's water systems (K. Boyce in litt.  1994). In general, mosquitofish are stocked in very small numbers  because they quickly reproduce to the maximum population levels that a  particular habitat may sustain. Mosquitofish are extremely tolerant of  polluted water with low levels of dissolved oxygen and have an  extremely wide range of temperature tolerance (Boyce 1994).  Mosquitofish prey on the California newt (Taricha torosa) (Gamradt and  Kats 1996) and Pacific treefrog (Goodsell and Kats 1999) larvae in both  field and laboratory experiments, even given the optional prey of  mosquito larvae (Goodsell and Kats 1999; Lee Kats, Pepperdine  University, pers. comm. 1999). Both newt and Pacific treefrog larvae  were found in stomachs of wild-caught mosquitofish (Goodsell and Kats  1999; L. Kats, pers. comm. 1999). Robert Stebbins observed mosquitofish  ingesting and then spitting out California newt larvae, causing severe  damage to the newts in the process (Graf 1993). Schmieder and Nauman  (1993) found that mosquitofish significantly affected the survival of  both prefeeding and large larvae of California red-legged frogs. Lawler  et al. (1999) did not find a reduction in survival rates of California  red-legged frog tadpoles raised in the presence of mosquitofish versus  controls with no mosquitofish, but those tadpoles that did survive  weighed less than control tadpoles and metamorphosed later, and most  were injured by the fish. Smaller size at metamorphosis may reduce  survival to breeding age and reproductive potential Morey 1998,  Semlitsch et al. 1988). Salamanders may be especially vulnerable to  mosquitofish predation due to their fluttering external gills, which  may attract these visual predators (Graf 1993). Loredo-Prendeville et  al. (1994) found no California tiger salamanders in ponds with  mosquitofish. Due to the documented effects of mosquitofish on other  amphibian species, we believe that they are likely to have similar  effects on California tiger salamanders and that the use of  mosquitofish in salamander habitat threatens the persistence of the  salamander populations.  [[Page 3102]]      Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarki) also apparently  prey on California tiger salamanders (Shaffer, et al. 1993) and may  have eliminated some populations (Jennings and Hayes 1994). The  crayfish prey on California newt eggs and larvae, in spite of toxins  that the species has developed, and may be a significant factor in the  loss of newts from several streams in southern California (Gamradt and  Kats 1996). These crayfish are found in two salamander breeding sites  in Santa Barbara County, but their effect on egg and larval survival is  unknown (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1999).     California tiger salamander larvae also are preyed upon by many  native species. In healthy salamander populations such predation is  probably not a significant threat, but when combined with other  impacts, such as predation by nonnative species, contaminants, or  habitat alteration, it may cause a significant decrease in population  viability. Native predators include great blue herons (Ardea herodias)  and egrets (Casmerodius albus), western pond turtles (Clemmys  marmorata), various garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.), larger California  tiger salamander larvae, larger spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus hammondii)  larvae, and California red-legged frogs (Mike Peters, Service, in.  litt. 1993; Hansen and Tremper 1993).  D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms      The primary cause of the decline of the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders is the loss, degradation,  and fragmentation of habitat from human activities. Federal, State, and  local laws have not been sufficient to prevent past and ongoing losses   of California tiger salamander habitat. Federal     Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (Corps) to issue individual or general permits for  the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United  States, which include navigable waters, wetlands (e.g., vernal pools),  and other seasonal ponds typically used by breeding salamanders.  Projects that involve only the excavation of pools or that alter the  watershed and hydrological regime of the pool but do not involve  ``discharge'' into the pool do not require a section 404 permit (Coe  1988). General permits include both nationwide and regional permits and  may allow projects to proceed without the scrutiny afforded through the  individual permitting process.     Of particular concern relative to the persistence of California  tiger salamanders are activities conducted under Nationwide Permit  (NWP) Number 26 (33 CFR part 330 Appendix A), which authorizes an  applicant to fill up to 1.2 ha (3 ac) of waters and wetlands, including  vernal pools and seasonal ponds. Filling of less than 0.13 ha (0.33 ac)  of isolated waters can be undertaken without notifying the Corps of the  proposed activity. If the activity will affect between 0.13 and 0.4 ha  (0.33 and 1 ac) of wetlands, an applicant is required to notify the  Corps, but the Corps is not required to notify resource agencies unless  the project may affect a listed species or designated critical habitat.  Because vernal pools are often small and scattered across the  landscape, projects, even very large development projects that fill  hundreds of vernal pools, can be authorized under NWP 26. Numerous  small projects in a given area also could be authorized, cumulatively  resulting in the loss of significant amounts of wetland and associated  upland habitats, with significant negative effects on local and  regional biodiversity (Semlitsch and Brodie 1998).     Projects affecting between 0.4 ha and 1.2 ha (1 ac and 3 ac) of  isolated waters also can be authorized under NWP 26 after the Corps  circulates a pre-discharge notification to the Service and other  resource agencies for review and comments. For such projects, the Corps  can place special conditions requiring minimization of impacts and/or  compensatory mitigation on authorizations granted under NWP 26. The  Corps can require an individual permit for these projects if it  determines the project will have significant individual or cumulative  effects. However, the Corps generally is reluctant to withhold  authorization under NWP 26 unless a listed threatened or endangered  species is known to be present. Also, the Corps often confines its  evaluation of impacts to those areas under its jurisdiction (i.e.,  wetlands and other waters of the United States). Impacts to uplands and  mitigation for upland habitat losses usually are not addressed by the  Corps. Preservation of existing pools without protection of large  blocks of suitable uplands is unlikely to result in the persistence of  viable salamander populations because the salamanders require both  aquatic and upland habitats during their life cycle. Thus, section 404  provides insufficient protection of small isolated wetlands.     An individual permit is required for projects filling or affecting  1.2 ha (3 ac) or more of isolated waters. Individual permits are  subject to review by the Service, other resource agencies, and the  public. When we review the permit, we may recommend measures to avoid,  minimize, or mitigate losses. In some cases, compensatory mitigation  (e.g., the creation of artificial wetlands) is incorporated in the  Corps permit as a Special Condition. However, problems associated with  such compensatory measures often decrease or eliminate the habitat  value for salamanders at the sites (DeWeese 1994).     The creation of artificial wetlands and ponds as breeding habitat  for tiger salamanders has been used as a compensatory mechanism for the  loss of natural wetlands and pools. The long-term viability and  suitability of artificially created wetlands are unknown. In 1994 the  Service completed a report evaluating 30 wetland creation projects  authorized through the Corps of Engineers section 404 program (DeWeese  1994). Twenty-two projects ranged in age from 3 to 5 years old, and  eight projects were greater than 5 years old at the time of the study.  The Service found that, although it appeared the Service's goal of ``no  net loss of acreage'' was being met or exceeded, the value of the  habitat created, which included the local wildlife species that would  be expected to use the habitat, was low. This situation was especially  the case for vernal pools and seasonal wetlands that had a value of  only 20 and 40 percent (respectively) of what existed previously.  Particular problems were noted for these habitat types, which often  were inundated (flooded) for longer than natural systems or more  frequently. The study concluded that, of the 600 ac of proposed  mitigation, half were meeting less than 75 percent of the mitigation  conditions. Mitigation and compensation for impacts to larger wetlands  under section 404 have failed to reduce threats to California tiger  salamanders.     The conversion of grazing land to intensive agricultural uses that  may adversely affect the California tiger salamander generally is  unregulated at any level of government. For example, the Corps has  promulgated regulations that exempt some farming, forestry, and  maintenance activities from the regulatory requirements of section 404  (33 CFR 323.4). Therefore, not all activities that destroy or degrade  vernal pools require Corps authorization. Certain normal farming  activities, including discing and plowing to depths less than 16 in,  can degrade or destroy vernal pools without requiring a permit because  these activities are exempt under the Clean Water Act. However,  [[Page 3103]]  deep-ripping, which disrupts the water-retaining hardpan that underlies  vernal pools and other seasonal wetlands, of lands formerly used for  ranching (i.e., grazing) or dry-land farming (e.g., non-irrigated hay  production) represents a ``change in use'' of the lands and is not  considered a normal and ongoing farming activity. As such, the practice  triggers section 404(f)(2) of the CWA, and requires review by and a  permit from the Corps (R. H. Wayland III, U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency, and D. R. Burns, Corps, in litt. 1996). However, as discussed  previously, the Corps typically asserts jurisdiction only over the  actual wetlands, not over the surrounding uplands. State     The State of California recognizes the California tiger salamander  as a species of special concern under the California Endangered Species  Act (ESA), and has placed this species on the list of protected  amphibians, which means that it may not be taken without a special  (i.e., scientific collecting) permit (CRC, Title 14, Section 41).  However, this protection applies only to actual possession or  intentional killing of individual animals, and affords no protection to  habitat. Activities that destroy habitat and kill salamanders in the  process are not regulated.     The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) offers some  opportunities to protect rare threatened and endangered plants and  animals and declares that it is the policy of the State to ``(p)revent  the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man's activities,  ensure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self- perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generations  representations of all plant and animal communities.'' (California  Public Resources Code, section 21001(c) 1999). Species do not have to  be listed under the Federal or California ESAs to meet the  determination of rare (California Code of Regulations (CRC), Title 14,  Chapter 3, Section 15380(b)(2)). Species that have been classified as  ``species of special concern'' are considered rare for the purposes of  CEQA. When the CEQA process is triggered, it requires full disclosure  of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. However,  the CEQA review process is not triggered unless issuance of a permit  associated with a project is considered ``discretionary'' rather than  ``ministerial.'' The public agency with primary authority or  jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency and is  responsible for conducting a review of the project and consulting with  the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the  project. Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of  significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or  restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Once  significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option to  require mitigation for effects through changes in the projects or to  decide that overriding social or economic considerations make  mitigation infeasible. In the latter case, projects may be approved  that cause significant environmental damage, such as destruction of  rare species. Protection of listed or rare species through CEQA is,  therefore, dependent upon the discretion of the agency involved.  Therefore, the effectiveness of this statute in protecting California  tiger salamanders and their vernal pool and upland habitats has not  been consistent. Local     In Santa Barbara County, no specific regulatory protection exists  for vernal pools, surrounding uplands, and their associated species,  including California tiger salamanders. Some provisions are  discretionary and could provide some measure of protection. For  example, the Santa Barbara County Grading Ordinance (Ordinance 3937,  Chapter 14 of the County Code) states that the issuance of a grading  permit is discretionary (Section 14--6.(a)), and that ``no person shall  cause or allow a significant environmental impact to occur as a result  of new grading as defined herein, including grading that is otherwise  exempt from these regulations.'' In one case in 1998, the Planning  Department required, after the fact, a permit, the preparation of an  environmental impact report, and mitigation for the discing of a vernal  pool and the deep-ripping of uplands associated with that and an  adjacent, larger pool in preparation for vineyard installation (Albert  J. McCurdy, Deputy Director, Santa Barbara County Planning and  Development, in litt. 1998a). Those requirements were overturned by the  County Board of Supervisors (A. McCurdy, in litt. 1998b). The Corps did  require a small set-aside approximately 5.7 ha (14 ac) to provide a  narrow buffer around both ponds, as mitigation for the discing of the  smaller pool (David Castanon, Army Corps of Engineers, in litt. 1999).  In another case, grazing lands surrounding another pool were converted  to row crops to the edge of the pool. Although discing and other  activities clearly degraded the wetland, no agency has required any  review, permits, or mitigation for the activities.     Typically, California tiger salamander habitat has been eliminated  without offsetting mitigation measures. Most mitigation plans that have  been required were designed specifically for vernal pool plants and did  not consider the upland habitats, including mammal burrows, needed by  salamanders, or their dispersal needs. As indicated above, the  artificial creation of vernal pools and seasonal wetlands as  compensatory mitigation has not been proven scientifically to be  successful over the long term (Zedler and Black 1988, Ferren and  Gevirtz 1990, Zedler and Calloway 1999). Race and Fonseca (1996)  reviewed numerous published and unpublished documents, which  collectively analyzed over 2,000 permitted wetland mitigation projects,  and concluded that significant wetland losses will continue unless  compliance with existing regulations and permits is improved, more  habitat is generated, and more fully functioning wetlands are created.  E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence      Several other factors, including habitat fragmentation,  contaminants, hybridization with and competition from introduced  species, and effects from oil production and over-grazing may have  negative effects on California tiger salamanders and their aquatic and  upland habitats. Fragmentation     Amphibian populations may be prone to local extinction due to  human-caused fragmentation (Findlay and Houlahan 1996, Gibbs 1998). The  primary factors that cause habitat fragmentation are road construction,  urbanization, and intensive agriculture (Mader 1984; Saunders et al.  1991). All documented localities of California tiger salamanders in  Santa Barbara County are affected by railroads, highways, or other  roads that have caused extensive fragmentation of the landscape. The  dispersal and migration distances of California tiger salamanders  require a large amount of barrier-free landscape (Loredo, et al. 1996;  Shaffer, et al. 1993). Large roads and highways represent permanent  physical obstacles and can block California tiger salamanders from  moving to new breeding habitat or prevent them from returning to their  breeding ponds or estivation sites. Road construction can reduce or  completely eliminate the breeding population of an entire pond and, in  some cases, large portions of a metapopulation.     Two Santa Barbara County tiger salamander breeding ponds are within  0.4 km (0.2 mi) of a railroad that runs  [[Page 3104]]  between them, possibly reducing migration and genetic interchange  between the ponds. In addition to the barriers created by fill  deposited in small canyons and watercourses, the railroad tracks  themselves can act as barriers to migrating salamanders (Thomas R.  Jones, Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, in litt. 1993). The  animals have difficulty getting under the tracks unless adequate holes  are present.     All 13 remaining breeding sites in Santa Barbara County are near  roads of various sizes. Four are within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of a major U.S.  highway that bisects the pond complex, two are bounded by a State  highway, one is immediately adjacent to a secondary road (as was the  one destroyed in 1998), five are within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of secondary  roads, and one is in an oil field with dirt roads in the vicinity  (Sweet, et al. 1998a). Findlay and Houlahan (1996) found that roads  within 2 km (1.2 mi) of wetlands adversely affected the number of  amphibian species in the wetlands.     Large numbers of California tiger salamanders, up to 15 or 20 per  mile of road (Joe Medeiros, Sierra College, pers. comm. 1993), are  killed as they cross the roads on breeding migrations (Hansen and  Tremper 1993; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993). Estimates of losses to  automobile traffic range from 25 to 72 percent of the breeding  population (Twitty 1941; S. Sweet, in litt. 1993; Launer and Fee 1996).  Curbs and berms as low as 9 to 12 cm (3.5 to 5 in), which allow  salamanders to climb onto the road but can restrict or prevent their  movements off the roads, are of particular concern, as they effectively  turn the roads into death traps (Launer and Fee 1996; S. Sweet, in  litt. 1998a). Such berms exist on the State highway and the secondary  road adjacent to three ponds in Santa Barbara County.     Although few currently used breeding ponds are within 0.5 km (0.3  mi) of urban developments, the rapid expansion of Santa Maria and  nearby communities will continue to fragment the remaining habitat. The  urbanization of the Santa Maria River and Orcutt Creek Valleys divided  what was probably a large, relatively contiguous tiger salamander  population extending from the Casmalia Hills in the west to Fulger  Point in the east into isolated subpopulations (West Orcutt, Bradley- Dominion) that are no longer capable of genetic interchange. One pond  in the West Orcutt area is adjacent to an urban development, the owner  of the other two ponds in that area has expressed a desire to develop  his property (E. Gevirtz, pers. comm. 1999), and home sites are being  marketed in the Bradley-Dominion area. Contaminants     Hydrocarbon and other contamination from oil production and road  runoff; the application of numerous chemicals for agricultural  production, roadside maintenance, urban/suburban landscape maintenance;  and rodent and vector control programs may all have negative effects on  tiger salamander populations, as detailed below.     Road mortality is not the only risk factor associated with roads,  as oil and other contaminants in runoff have been detected in adjacent  ponds and linked to die-offs of and deformities in California tiger  salamanders and spadefoot toads and die-offs of invertebrates that form  most of both species' prey base (S. Sweet, in litt. 1993). Lefcort et  al. (1997) found that oil had limited direct effects on 5-week-old  marbled (A. opacum) and eastern tiger salamanders (A. t. tigrinum), but  that salamanders from oil-contaminated natural ponds metamorphosed  earlier at smaller sizes and those from oil-contaminated artificial  ponds had slower growth rates than larvae raised in non-contaminated  ponds. Their studies did not address effects on eggs and early larval  stages, where the effects may be more pronounced. Hatch and Burton  (1998) and Monson et al. (1999) investigated the effects of one  component of petroleum products and urban runoff (fluoranthene, a  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) on spotted salamanders (A. maculatum),  northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), and African clawed frogs  (Xenopus laevis). In laboratory and outdoor experiments, using levels  of the contaminant comparable to those found in service station and  other urban runoff, the researchers found reduced survival and growth  abnormalities in all species and that the effects were worse when the  larvae were exposed to the contaminant under natural levels of  sunlight, rather than in the laboratory under artificial light. Agricultural Contaminants     Even though most of the crop lands in California have been in  agricultural production since 1900, the application and associated  effects of large amounts of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and  nitrogen fertilizers on the landscape have been addressed only recently  (Burow et al. 1998a,b). The concentrations of these chemicals and their  immediate effects on various species have been difficult to assess  mainly due to lack of water sample data and lack of samples close to  the sources of application where the effects on wildlife are most  severe. In 1986-87 and from 1993 to 1997, USGS and California  Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) personnel sampled well and  ground water at 156 locations throughout the range of the California  tiger salamander (CDPR 1998; Burow et al. 1998a,b). From these samples,  29 different chemicals potentially toxic to amphibians in general and  California tiger salamanders specifically were detected.     In Santa Barbara County, over 1 million kilograms (kg) (2.2 million  pounds (lb)) of agricultural chemicals were used in 1994 on  strawberries, grapes, lettuce, broccoli, and carrots, which were the  five major crop types grown on or near tiger salamander sites at that  time (California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Internet  Website). These chemicals included metam-sodium, methyl bromide, maneb,  fosetyl-aluminum, acephate, cryolite, chlorpyrifos, and malathion, some  of which are extremely toxic to aquatic organisms, including amphibians  and the organisms on which they prey.     Metam-sodium, a carbamate, was one of the main chemicals applied on  broccoli and lettuce grown in 1994, when over 114,000 kg (over 250,000  lb) were used in Santa Barbara County (CDFA). Metam-sodium is toxic to  fish (Meister 1997). However, no test data are available for  amphibians.     Chlorpyrifos is a highly toxic organophosphate insecticide applied  as granules, wettable powder, dustable powder, or emulsifiable  concentrate (EXTOXNET 1996). Chlorpyrifos was detected at a  concentration of 0.006 micrograms/liter (<greek-m>g/l) in domestic well  water close to vineyards at one location (Burow et al. 1998a); however,  animals migrating across recently treated fields may be exposed to much  higher concentrations. The compound is absorbed through the skin of  mammals (EXTOXNET 1999); amphibians, with their more permeable skins,  absorb the chemical even more readily. General agricultural use of  chlorpyrifos is considered to pose a serious threat to wildlife  (EXTOXNET 1999). Over 6,000 kg (13,000 lb) were used in Santa Barbara  County in 1994 (CDFA).     Malathion has caused effects such as mortality, delays in  metamorphosis, and decreased size at metamorphosis in several species  of frogs and toads at concentrations as low as 0.2 milligrams (mg/l)  (Devillers and Exbrayat 1992). Malathion was detected at concentrations  up to 0.1 <greek-m>g/l in test wells near fields on which it has been  used (Burow 1998a). Over 3,500 kg  [[Page 3105]]  (7,800 lb) of malathion were used in Santa Barbara County in 1994  (CDFA).     Although test data for amphibian species could not be found, methyl  bromide is extremely toxic and is used to kill weeds, insects,  nematodes, and rodents (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). Methyl bromide is  used primarily on strawberries in Santa Barbara County, which are grown  extensively in the eastern Santa Maria Valley (Bradley-Dominion  metapopulation). Over 225,000 kg (500,000 lb) were used in Santa  Barbara County in 1994 (CDFA).     About 50 percent (6) of the remaining 13 documented California  tiger salamander breeding sites in Santa Barbara County may be directly  or indirectly affected by toxic agricultural chemical contaminants  because there is intensive agriculture within their drainage basins.  Even if toxic or detectable amounts of pesticides are not found in the  breeding ponds or groundwater, salamanders may still be affected,  particularly when chemicals are applied during the migration and  dispersal seasons. Rodent Control     California tiger salamanders spend much of their lives in  underground retreats, typically in the burrows of ground squirrels and  gophers (Loredo et al. 1996; Trenham 1998a). Widespread ground squirrel  control programs were begun in California as early as 1910 and are  carried out on more than 4 million ha (9.9 million ac) in California  (Marsh 1987). It is unclear how effective such control programs were in  reducing ground squirrel populations. According to Marsh (1987), when a  ground squirrel population is at or near carrying capacity, it must be  reduced by at least 90 percent annually for several years to  significantly reduce the population. However, it may not be practical  to attain such high reduction rates over large areas typical of  rangelands, but it may be possible to reduce populations to low numbers  (Salmon and Schmidt 1984). In some primarily agricultural counties, the  ground squirrel population has been reduced and maintained at perhaps  10 to 20 percent of the carrying capacity. Rodent control programs are  conducted by individual land owners and managers on grazing, vineyard,  and crop production lands (R. Thompson, in litt. 1998).     Until about 1990, ground squirrel control programs using compound  1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) were carried out on lands in Santa Barbara  County (Rosemary Thompson, Senior Biologist, SAIC, in litt. 1998).  Compound 1080 is extremely toxic to nontarget fish, birds, and mammals  (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1990) and may have contributed to  reductions in salamander populations in the areas where it was used.     Poisoned grains are the most common method used to control ground  squirrels on rangelands, and there is little risk of ingestion by  California tiger salamanders. However, the use of these grains may  impact the California tiger salamanders indirectly if washed into  burrows or ponds used by the species. Two of the most commonly used  rodenticides, chlorophacinone and diphacinone, are anticoagulants that  cause animals to bleed to death. They can be absorbed through the skin  and are considered toxic to fish and wildlife (EPA 1985, EXTOXNET  1999). Both, along with strychnine, are used in Santa Barbara County to  control rodents (R. Thompson, in litt. 1998). Zinc phosphide, an acute  rodenticide and a restricted material, turns into a toxic gas once  ingested. Although the effects of these poisons on California tiger  salamanders have not been assessed, use along roadways or railways may  result in contamination of salamander breeding ponds, with undetermined  effects. Gases, including aluminum phosphide, carbon monoxide, and  methyl bromide, can be introduced into burrows either by using  cartridges or by pumping. When such fumigants are used, all animals  inhabiting the burrow are killed (Salmon and Schmidt 1984).     In addition to possible direct effects of rodent control chemicals,  control programs probably have an adverse indirect effect on California  tiger salamander populations. Control of ground squirrels could  significantly reduce the number of burrows available for use by the  species (Loredo-Prendeville et al. 1994). Because the burrow density  required to support California tiger salamanders in an area is not  known, the loss of burrows as a result of control programs cannot be  quantified at this time. However, Shaffer, et al. (1993) believe that  rodent control programs may be responsible for the lack of California  tiger salamanders in some areas. Active ground squirrel colonies  probably are needed to sustain tiger salamanders because inactive  burrow systems become progressively unsuitable over time. Loredo et al.  (1996) found that burrow systems collapsed within 18 months following  abandonment by or loss of the ground squirrels; although the  researchers found that California tiger salamanders used both occupied  and unoccupied burrows, they did not indicate that the salamanders used  collapsed burrows. Rodent control programs must be analyzed and  implemented carefully in California tiger salamander habitat so the  persistence of the salamanders is not threatened. Current risks to the  salamander in Santa Barbara County from rodent control programs are  unknown.  Mosquito Control      A commonly used method to control mosquitoes, including in Santa  Barbara County (Kenneth Leanard, Santa Barbara County Vector Control,  pers. comm. 1999) is the application of methoprene, which increases the  level of juvenile hormone in insect larvae and disrupts the molting  process. Lawrenz (1984-85) found that methoprene (Altosid<Register> SR- 10) retarded the development of selected crustacea that had the same  molting hormones (i.e., juvenile hormone) as insects and anticipated  that the same hormone may control metamorphosis in other arthropods.  Because the success of many aquatic vertebrates relies on an abundance  of invertebrates in temporary wetlands, any delay in insect growth  could reduce the numbers and density of prey available (Lawrenz 1984- 85). The use of methoprene thus could have an indirect adverse effect  on the California tiger salamander by reducing the availability of  prey. In more recent studies, although methoprene did not cause  increased mortality of gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles  (Sparling and Lowe 1998), it caused reduced survival rates and  increased malformations in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens)  (Ankley et al. 1998) and increased malformations in southern leopard  frogs (R. utricularia) (Sparling 1998). Blumberg et al. (1998) also  correlated exposure to methoprene with delayed metamorphosis and high  mortality rates in northern leopard and mink (R. septentrionalis)  frogs. Methoprene appears to have both direct and indirect effects on  the growth and survival of larval amphibians.     Other insecticides (e.g., temephos) have caused reductions in the  growth rates of gray treefrog tadpoles, increased mortality rates in  green frog (R. clamitans) tadpoles (Sparling and Lowe 1998), and  increased mortality rates in southern leopard frogs (Sparling 1998).  Few data are available on the effects of most insecticides on  salamanders. A bacterium, Bacillus thuringensis israeli (Bti), is also  used in Santa Barbara County for mosquito control (K. Leanard, pers.  comm. 1999). Its effects on the salamander prey base have not been  quantified. Because of a lack of information regarding which mosquito  control chemicals are used and where, and about the chemicals' effects  on salamanders, the degree to which the  [[Page 3106]]  practices directly affect the California tiger salamander in Santa  Barbara County cannot be determined at this time. Introduced Species     Introduced species can have negative effects on California tiger  salamander populations through competition and hybridization (Shaffer,  et al. 1993; H. B. Shaffer, in litt. 1999). Competition from fish that  prey on mosquito larvae and other invertebrates can reduce the survival  of salamanders. Both California tiger salamanders (Stebbins 1962; J. D.  Anderson 1968; Holomuzki 1986) and mosquitofish feed on micro and  macro-invertebrates; large numbers of mosquitofish may out-compete the  salamander larvae for food (Graf 1993). As urban areas continue to  expand, the introduction of mosquitofish into previously untreated  ponds may result in the elimination of California tiger salamanders  from additional breeding sites. The introduction of other fish either  inadvertently (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas) (P. Collins, pers.  comm. 1999) or for recreational fishing (e.g., bass (Micropterus  salmoides, M. dolomieui), sunfish (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1999) or other  purposes may also affect the prey base, reducing growth and survival  rates of salamanders. Fish such as bass, green sunfish (L. cyanellus),  carp (Cyprinus carpio), and bullhead (Ictalurus spp.) may also prey on  tiger salamander larvae, reducing or eliminating populations (Shaffer,  et al. 1993).     Various nonnative subspecies of the tiger salamander, Ambystoma  tigrinum, have been imported into much of California for use as fish  bait. The practice is still legal in California but is now restricted  to fewer counties and is regulated by the California Department of Fish  and Game (CCR Title 14, Division 1, Subdivision 1, Chapter 2, Article  3, Section 4 1999). Although importation into Santa Barbara County is  illegal, introduced tiger salamanders have been documented at one  locality west of the Santa Rita Valley (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998).  Although they have not been documented in California tiger salamander  habitat nonnative salamanders could potentially be introduced into  breeding sites or into nearby ponds. The introduced salamanders may  out-compete the California tiger salamander, or interbreed with the  natives to create hybrids that may be less adapted to the California  climate or are not reproductively viable past the first or second  generations (Bury and Lukenbach 1976; Shaffer, et al. 1993). More  recent evidence suggests that the hybrids are viable, and that they  breed with California tiger salamanders (H. B. Shaffer, in litt. 1999).  With so few remaining subpopulations of California tiger salamanders in  Santa Barbara County, the loss of any to hybridization with or  competition from introduced species is of serious concern. Grazing     Grazing in many cases has positive, or at least neutral, effects on  the California tiger salamander (H. B. Shaffer and Peter Trenham, UCD,  pers. comm. 1998; S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998; 1999). By keeping  vegetation shorter, grazing can make areas more suitable for ground  squirrels, whose burrows are used by California tiger salamanders. In  Santa Barbara County, the only remaining sites with large amounts of  suitable salamander habitat (eight ponds at five sites) currently are  being grazed. Although cattle drink large quantities of water,  sometimes causing temporary pools to dry faster than they otherwise  would (Sheri Melanson, Service, in litt. 1993) and possibly causing  breeding pools to dry too quickly for salamanders to be able to  metamorphose (Feaver 1971), these rangelands are the only undeveloped  habitat in the area and thus provide the only chance for salamanders to  breed successfully. Although Melanson (1993) noted that vernal pool  species continued to reproduce under a November-to-April grazing  regime, California tiger salamanders were either absent or found in low  numbers in portions of pools that were heavily trampled by cattle.  Continued trampling of a ponds' edge by cattle can increase the surface  area of a pond and may increase water temperature and speed up the rate  of evaporation and thus reduce the amount of time the pond contains  enough water (S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998). Cattle hoofprints could trap  salamanders as water levels in pools recede, and reduction in water  quality caused by cattle excrement may negatively affect the animals  mainly by increasing potentially detrimental nitrogen levels. High  nitrogen levels have been associated with blooms of deadly bacteria  (Worthylake and Hovingh 1989), and silt has been associated with fatal  fungal infections (Lefcort et al. 1997) (see Factor C of this section).  However, grazing generally is compatible with the continued use of  rangelands by the California tiger salamander as long as intensive  burrowing rodent control programs are not implemented on such areas and  grazing is not excessive (T. Jones, in litt. 1993; Shaffer, et al.  1993; S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1998, 1999).  Reason for Emergency Determination      Under section 4(b)(7) of the Act and regulations at 50 CFR 424.20,  we may emergency list a species if the threats to the species  constitute an emergency posing a significant risk to its well-being.  Such an emergency listing expires 240 days following publication in the  Federal Register unless, during this 240-day period, we list the  species following the normal listing procedures. Below, we discuss the  reasons why emergency listing the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders as endangered is necessary. In accordance  with the Act, if at any time after we publish this emergency rule, we  determine that substantial evidence does not exist to warrant such a  rule, we will withdraw it.     In making this determination, we have carefully assessed the best  scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,  present, and future threats faced by the Santa Barbara County  population of California tiger salamanders. This DPS is one of the two  most genetically differentiated populations of the species and is  restricted to very few breeding ponds, all of which are threatened by  agricultural conversion, fragmentation, and development. As discussed  under Factor A of this section, ponds and upland habitats are being  lost at a rapid rate in all four regions of the county in which the  species occurs, and no preserves have been established to protect the  species. As discussed in Factor E of this section, this salamander is a  DPS and still occurs in a significant part of its historic range, but  the remaining subpopulations are becoming increasingly fragmented and  thus vulnerable to threats associated with isolation and small  population size. From the discussion under Factor D of this section, it  is clear that Federal, State, and local regulations and ordinances,  individually and collectively, do not provide adequate protection for  California tiger salamanders or assure that California tiger  salamanders will continue to survive in Santa Barbara County.     The 14 known breeding sites (1 was destroyed in 1998 (G.  McLaughlin, in litt. 1999) and several others may no longer support  breeding) are all located on privately owned land, and no conservation  agreements or easements are in place. Given the extremely rapid rate of  recent and projected habitat loss and degradation, this DPS is in  imminent danger of extinction throughout its historic range. The  survival of the Santa Barbara County population of the California tiger  [[Page 3107]]  salamander now depends on protecting as many breeding sites and the  associated upland habitats from further degradation and destruction as  possible, and on the rapid rehabilitation of sites that have been  seriously degraded in the last few years. The remaining subpopulations  in Santa Barbara County are vulnerable to extinction from random  natural or human-caused events unless sufficient habitat can be  protected and the subpopulations increased in size.  Critical Habitat      In the last few years, a series of court decisions have overturned  Service determinations regarding a variety of species that designation  of critical habitat would not be prudent (e.g., Natural Resources  Defense Council v. U.S. Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d 1121 (9th  Cir. 1997); Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp. 2d  1280 (D. Hawaii 1998)). Based on the standards applied in those  judicial opinions, we have examined the question of whether critical  habitat for the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander would  be prudent.     Due to the small number of populations the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander is vulnerable to unrestricted collection,  vandalism, or other disturbance. We remain concerned that these threats  might be exacerbated by the publication of critical habitat maps and  further dissemination of locational information. However, we have  examined the evidence available for Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander and have not found specific evidence of taking,  vandalism, collection, or trade of this species. Consequently,  consistent with applicable regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)(i)) and  recent case law, we do not expect that the identification of critical  habitat will increase the degree of threat to this species of taking or  other human activity.     In the absence of a finding that critical habitat would increase  threats to a species, if there are any benefits to critical habitat  designation, then a prudent finding is warranted. In the case of this  species, there may be some benefits to designation of critical habitat.  The primary regulatory effect of critical habitat is the section 7  requirement that Federal agencies refrain from taking any action that  destroys or adversely modifies critical habitat. While a critical  habitat designation for habitat currently occupied by this species  would not be likely to change the section 7 consultation outcome  because an action that destroys or adversely modifies such critical  habitat would also be likely to result in jeopardy to the species,  there may be instances where section 7 consultation would be triggered  only if critical habitat is designated. Examples could include  unoccupied habitat or occupied habitat that may become unoccupied in  the future. There may also be some educational or informational  benefits to designating critical habitat. Therefore, we find that  critical habitat is prudent for the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander.     The Final Listing Priority Guidance for FY 2000 (64 FR 57114)  states, ``The processing of critical habitat determinations (prudency  and determinability decisions) and proposed or final designations of  critical habitat will be funded separately from other section 4 listing  actions and will no longer be subject to prioritization under the  Listing Priority Guidance. Critical habitat determinations, which were  previously included in final listing rules published in the Federal  Register, may now be processed separately, in which case stand-alone  critical habitat determinations will be published as notices in the  Federal Register. We will undertake critical habitat determinations and  designations during FY 2000 as allowed by our funding allocation for  that year.'' As explained in detail in the Listing Priority Guidance,  our listing budget is currently insufficient to allow us to immediately  complete all of the listing actions required by the Act. Deferral of  the critical habitat designation for the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander will allow us to concentrate our limited  resources on higher priority critical habitat and other listing  actions, while allowing us to put in place protections needed for the  conservation of the Santa Barbara County California tiger salamander  without further delay.     We plan to employ a priority system for deciding which outstanding  critical habitat designations should be addressed first. We will focus  our efforts on those designations that will provide the most  conservation benefit, taking into consideration the efficacy of  critical habitat designation in addressing the threats to the species,  and the magnitude and immediacy of those threats. We will develop a  proposal to designate critical habitat for the Santa Barbara County  California tiger salamander as soon as feasible, considering our  workload priorities.  Available Conservation Measures      Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  practices. Recognition through listing results in public awareness and  conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private  organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land  acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery  actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required  of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities  involving listed species are discussed, in part, below.     Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  listed as endangered or threatened, and with respect to its critical  habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR  part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to  confer with us on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued  existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse  modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed  subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that  activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal agency action may  affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible  Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with us. Federal  agency actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County population of  California tiger salamanders and may require conference and/or  consultation with us include, but are not limited to, those within the  jurisdiction of the Corps, Bureau of Reclamation, Natural Resources  Conservation Service, Federal Farm Bureau, and Federal Highway  Administration.     The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set  forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for  any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take  (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,  capture, or collect; or attempt any such conduct), import or export,  ship in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial  activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce  any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,  carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been  [[Page 3108]]  taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to our agents and those of  State conservation agencies.     Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities  involving endangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations  governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. For  endangered species, such permits are available for scientific purposes,  to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and for  incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.     As published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34272),  it is our policy to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the  time a species is listed those activities that would or would not  constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this  policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on  proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range.     We believe that, based on the best available information, the  following actions are not likely to result in a violation of section 9,  provided these actions are carried out in accordance with any existing  regulations and permit requirements:     (1) Possession of a Santa Barbara County California tiger  salamander legally acquired prior to the effective date of this rule  and consistent with 50 CFR 17.4;     (2) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are authorized, funded, or carried out by a  Federal agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with an  incidental take statement issued by us under section 7 of the Act;     (3) Actions that may affect the Santa Barbara County California  tiger salamander that are not authorized, funded, or carried out by a  Federal agency, when the action is conducted in accordance with an  incidental take statement issued by us under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the  Act. Applicants design a plan or a Habitat Conservation Plans and apply  for an incidental take permit.

GX238-65-16198560	"Lingua Botanica A Journal for FS Botanists & Plant Ecologists So there I was... Sitting in my car in the early evening darkness of October's new moon in front of the ornate and historic Candler Building (http://www.ci.atlanta.ga.us/DEPT/URBAN/candler.htm) in the heart of downtown Atlanta waiting for my honey to get off work when, in the periphery of my vision, I saw a brown blur which was immediately followed by a dull thud on the car window just behind my head. Whether you have a healthy paranoia of big cities or are acclimated to the urban landscape, the list of unappealing things that might explain the brown thud are probably similar. And yet in reflecting on that list, an American Woodcock (Scolopax minor) did not score in the top 50th percentile. Nevertheless, there sitting on the sidewalk to my immediate left was a dazed and confused ball of feathers with much too much bill. Woodcocks are nocturnal birds that typically inhabit hedgerows and thickets and it is probable that this poor creature was migrating at the time of its untimely run in with 17 floors of marble (of course, it may have also bounced off the 52-story Georgia Pacific building across the street...). I immediately got out of my car to help the pitiful thing and the story ends happily enough with the bird eventually finding its way into the night, away from tall buildings and blinding streetlights. It was a mirabile dictu experience (this was not, after all, a possum, rat, or pigeon) and it made me think about urban plant-life. ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" (which was probably an Ailanthus...) records our fascination with wild urban silva, but the truth is that hundreds of native and exotic vascular and nonvascular plants inhabit the cracks and imperfections of our cities. We see Panicums and Poas pushing through the pavement, kudzu clambering over concrete, and Grindelias in the gutter grates. But what would it take to impress/surprise you? Botrychiums at the bus-stop? Fritillarias against the fireplugs? Penstemons filling parking structures. As botanists, our heads turn to admire the anarchy symbolized by flowers escaping the concrete and asphalt. Rare or common, native or exotic, we know that a single flower presages a new generation of entropic roots and stems and that they will eventually win. Do a friend a favor, let them in on the secret. Rage against the machine, seed the cities. the editor.

However, the role of fire in lichen communities has not been studied. Cladonia perforata, an endangered terrestrial lichen, co-occurs with several other congenerics on bare sand of endemic-rich rosemary scrub. A prescribed fire at Archbold Biological Station on the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge impacted three separate populations of C. perforata in July 1993, leaving only remnant unburned patches scattered among completely burned areas. I investigated the rate and mode of post-fire recovery of C. perforata in comparison with co-occurring common species in order to inform management decisions consistent with maintenance of these lichen populations. Detailed GPS maps of individual patches of this lichen were made in January 1997 and compared with those made in August 1999. Abundance of all lichen species was monitored yearly during the winters of 1997-1999. Although all of the other terrestrial species in the same habitat recovered from juvenile stages, no juvenile forms of C. perforata were recorded. The area occupied by C. perforata increased by more than 200% on average, over the three sites. However, population growth (abundance measures for all species) is so far too slow to have documented and did not change markedly over this interval. Therefore, dispersal of unburned C. perforata into burned areas may be the primary method of short-term population recovery.  2   Save the Dietary Supplements! Marc Borbely, Washington Post, 14 November 2000  The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)--which claims the panda as its mascot and 4.7 million sentient mammals as its supporters--has launched a campaign to protect some embattled weeds. The group wants to protect wild goldenseal, American ginseng and other medicinal plants from over-harvesting, hoping that the herbal products' popularity will boost overall support for conservation of lands and plant species to which the public is otherwise indifferent. ""These are visible, well-recognized plants that we're trying to use to raise the awareness level of the conservation problems that face other native American plants,"" says WWF botanist Christopher Robbins. ""Ginseng is a household name, and we feel we can really get a lot of mileage out of [it] to raise general awareness among consumers."" There is widespread agreement among environmentalists that the plants require protection. The National Audubon Society has listed goldenseal and American ginseng-along with black cohosh, blue cohosh, echinacea and slippery elm--as the wild herbs conservationists deem most vulnerable to overpicking. The federal Fish and Wildlife Service last year restricted export of wild ginseng, citing a declining presence throughout much of North America, in part due to poaching. In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the largest of three major national parks where ginseng grows, 10,515 illegally harvested roots--worth about $53,200, or $5 per root--were seized between 1991 and 1999, according to the service. That represents only 1 percent of the actual amount poached, officials estimate. Some harvesters are unaware of the regulations and become poachers unwittingly, Robbins says. Others include ""the rural sort of old-timer who believes that his or her access to the woods should not be restricted,"" he says. There isn't a single mention of plants on WWF's endangered species Web site, which says the group works to ensure ""that the world our children inherit will be home to rhinos, tigers, giant pandas, whales, and other wildlife species, as well as people."" Plants, presumably, are ""other."" Robbins says environmentalists' focus on animals is starting to change. ""WWF is beginning to realize that some of these high profile plants are just as valuable and relevant in creating these campaigns,"" he says. ""Since plants don't have soft brown fur and cute little brown eyes, they don't get much attention compared with animals,"" says Steven Foster, a medicinal plant specialist who is joining forces with the WWF. Foster is a board member of United Plant Savers, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting native medicinal plants in the United States and Canada. Robbins thinks consumers might support a new tax to protect wild plant habitats, spending a penny or two more on every product containing wild American herbs. Wild American ginseng--25 to 50 times more expensive than its cultivated cousin because consumers in Asia consider it more therapeutically valuable--is picked on public or private lands by individuals who sell it to local dealers, who then pass it on to  3   manufacturers for processing. According to the Audubon Society, 95 percent of wild American ginseng is exported to Hong Kong. Proceeds from the herb tax would support federal anti-poaching activities, such as increasing the number of park rangers enforcing regulations. Most ginseng products sold in the United States would not be affected by the tax because they usually contain imported Asian ginseng. Other herbal products, however, are processed from American plants. The herbal industry isn't keen on the tax idea. ""I think it's a weak approach,"" says Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association, a trade group. There already is a permit system for harvesting herbs on federal lands, and there's no evidence that poaching is rampant, he says. ""I don't want my industry to bear the burden of a few illegal poachers."" Some consumer and health groups charge that the sales and marketing of herbal remedies is deceptive, since in most cases their safety and efficacy has not been proved. (Not so, replies the American Botanical Council. Wayne Silverman, the chief administrative officer of the group, which receives some of its support from the herbals industry, calls this criticism ""a myth."") Robbins says the question of the herbs' therapeutic value is immaterial to the protection campaign. ""We don't need to know whether or not ginseng is truly efficacious to know that the resource and the species is being truly exploited.""  Thieves Plunder ""Protected"" Forests in Russia Gary Strieker CNN.com 3 November 2000  Khabarovsk, Russia: Outlaws are plundering protected forests, cutting timber without licenses and targeting endangered tree species in the Far East of Russia. Federal authorities are unable, or unwilling, to stop it. But some Russians bear public witness to what's happening to their forests. One is Anatoly Lebedev, an environmental activist with his own TV show on a local network. He believes organized crime and corruption are behind the alarming increase in illegal logging. Authorities here have confiscated a truckload of a rare pine prized for furniture making, cut illegally from a protected reserve. But it's unlikely the lawbreakers will be punished, according to Lebedev. ""It means that just the people concerned with this timber, including officials and illegal loggers, will share the money which comes from the selling of the timber,"" he said. There is little control and much corruption. Even Chinese logging crews have been able to cross the border to steal timber from Russia's forests. Conservationists say this is like other crime waves in Russia, resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union. ""What has happened since the decline of the Soviet Union is the absence of state control and the breakup of large timber enterprises that were under state ownership,"" said Lebedev, an activist with the Bureau for Regional Public Campaigns.  4   Bankrupt state logging enterprises, including their processing mills, are now history, replaced by hundreds of small operators focused on exporting raw timber to hungry markets in Asia. Exporting raw logs is the sole source of revenue for most timber companies in Russia's Far East. Some 90 percent of timber production here is exported as unprocessed logs to Japan, China or South Korea. There is a new processing mill in the region, one of few, that provides jobs and tax revenues without exporting raw timber. Lebedev says expanding such timber processing operations is one way to curb illegal logging. ""We hope that as soon as logging companies will invest more money to processing they will create new jobs and turn people from illegal operations to the processing facilities,"" he said. Others say Russian authorities must attack corruption and re-assert control over timber resources. ""That's really the crisis. It's a crisis of control. It's a lack of control in the forest, and it's devastating the ecosystems here,"" said Josh Newell of Friends of the Earth, an international environmental activist group. He and other environmentalists say sustainable use of Russia's forests could eliminate widespread poverty and drive economic growth in this region. But the alternative -- what's happening now -- is a worsening environmental disaster.  Forest Values in Finland Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 1999  The forests harbour not only commercial and ecological values. They also offer a chance for recreation and nature observation. The social aspect of sustainability is thus well covered in Finland. Finns like moving about in nature; hiking or trekking in the woods, or skiing in wintertime along marked trails. Forests are a source of mental and physical well-being, adventure and sensations; a place to observe plants and animals in their natural surroundings. Everyman's right of access, based both on ancient traditions and partly even on law, gives everyone the right to move about freely outdoors on foot, on skis, by bicycle or on horseback. Motor vehicles are allowed only with permission from the land owner. Everyman's right of access applies to Finns and other nationalities alike. It is also allowed to pick wild berries and mushrooms on somebody else's land. Finns know how to make use of nature's offerings: millions of kilograms of berries and thousands of litres of mushrooms are picked every year. There are several edible berries growing wild in the Finnish forests: blueberry, lingonberry, cloudberry, cranberry, raspberry, wild strawberry, sea buckthorn, crowberry and bog bilberry. At best, one hectare may give several tens of kilos of lingonberry. There are even more edible mushrooms: bolete, chantarelle, milk cap, russula and horn of plenty. Some of this produce is sold retail, and sometimes picking berries and mushrooms is a locally important source of income.  5   In certain parts of northern Finland, gathering lichen for decorations is a commercially important activity. At best, the value of the lichen may exceed the value of the timber derived from the same area. Lichen is exported to a number of countries, especially Germany. Gathering lichen is not included in everyman's rights, it requires permission from the land owner. Reindeer in northern Finland are fed lichen in the winter. Usually the reindeer are allowed to forage freely. Reindeer husbandry in Lapland goes back more than one thousand years. There are about 7,000 reindeer farmers; the annual production of reindeer meat amounts to 2--3 million kilos, with a value of about 50 million Finnmarks (EUR 8.4 million). There are about 300,000 registered hunters in Finland. Hunting is not included in everyman's rights, but requires membership of a hunting association. The association then makes a deal with local land owners about using a certain area for hunting. There are different hunting seasons for various kinds of game. The most important game are elk, hare, duck and fowl. Forests are the Finn's spiritual home Forests are for the Finns a part of their national identity and for many artists their source of inspiration. In art, forests are often depicted as comforting arms offering shelter from danger and grief. The Finnish mentality is often likened to a forest or a tree. The pervading desire to get back to nature can be seen in the holiday period, when almost every Finn seeks rural harmony at his summer cottage. There are more than 400,000 summer cottages in Finland, most of them located in the middle of a forest or next to a lake. Forests play a central role in Finnish literature. The Finnish national epic, Kalevala, which is a compilation of ancient poems carried over generations as oral tradition, tells in its second poem about how different tree species were assigned to their sites when the earth was created: Hills he sowed for pines/ sowed mounds for spruces/ and heaths for heather/ and hollows for young saplings./ On lowlands he sowed birches/ alders in light soils/ sowed bird cherries in new soils/ and rowans on holy ground/ and willows on rising ground/ junipers on barren lands/ and oaks on the banks of streams. (translation: Keith Bosley) Finland's national writer Aleksis Kivi, who lived in the 19th century, describes in his most famous work, Seven Brothers, the life of seven orphaned young men who spend their days wandering and hunting in the woods. When they grow up, each of them builds a home and farms the land, but the forest always stays in his mind. The brothers are like the Finnish society of the time: moving towards agriculture but still in many ways depending on the forests. The landscape in Kivi's work is the one of his own childhood: deep woods, huge boulders, heaths, meadows and streams. A great many other Finnish writers and poems have depicted forests and trees in their work, often as a symbol of freedom and safety. The Year of the Hare, by the novelist Arto Paasilinna, deals with man's relationship with nature. The story ends with the main character fleeing from society into the woods. Veikko Huovinen's Tale of the wood-folk pays a tribute to the Finnish forest and its inhabitants, the trees.  6   The forests have also inspired many Finnish artists. Especially painters at the end of the 19th century chose to depict the wilderness. Akseli Gallen-Kallela's Kalevala motifs present pristine nature, along with the wild landscape and the tough inhabitants of the Finnish woods. The internationally well-known Finnish architect, Alvar Aalto, created a unique modernistic style the aesthetics of which are based on minute planning of the building in relation to its surroundings, humane proportions and feel for the material at hand. He wished to make his buildings echo the forms and shapes of the Finnish lake-sprinkled landscape and to bring out the inherent qualities of wood. Some of Aalto's designs for curved wooden furniture are still in production. Education gives forestry know-how The roots of forestry training and education in Finland reach back almost 150 years. Today, two universities offer training at the highest academic level. Eight Polytechnics turn out more practically trained Bachelors of Forestry. In different parts of the country, there are vocational schools and institutions training foresters and loggers. For instance, a harvester driver needs knowledge and skills in the area of ecology and environmental considerations in addition to a knowledge of forestry and modern technology. Finnish forest research was initiated in the early 20th century. This extensive work for increasing our knowledge of the forests has gained international recognition. Comprehensive forest research for practical needs One of the first acts after Finland had gained independence was to found a forest research institute. Its tasks included producing basic factual knowledge pertaining to the forests. Many of the scientists of the time have gone into history thanks to their prominent research. The Forest Research Institute was the first body to launch a systematic inventory of forest resources on a national scale. The first National Forest Inventory (NFI) was carried out during the period 1921--1924. Since then, Finland's forests have been surveyed eight times, and the ninth inventory currently underway started in 1996. The NFI gives information on the forest resources, stock volume and growth, health, land use, forest ownership and, the latest addition, biodiversity. The inventory results constitute a unique time series covering the development of the Finnish forests for almost 80 years. Over time, the methods have improved; today satellite imaging is used, and the results are applicable to more limited areas. They can even be used at municipal level. Forest research looks at all the links in the chain, from forest ecology to market surveys of the final products. Forestry research in Finland is carried out by the Forest Research Institute METLA, universities and polytechnics, and private research institutions.  7   Asa Gray 1810-1888 W.F. Gabel, 1979, Two Hundred Years of Botanical Nomenclature  Asa Gray, one of the foremost botanists of his time, was born in Paris Furnace, New York in 1810. Although not college trained, he had a remarkable literary style, noted for its lucidity and elegance. He studied medicine in a physician's office and obtained the degree of M.D. in 1831. In New York City he became acquainted with John Torrey, who secured for him the position of curator of the New York Lyceum of Natural History. This began his career as a professional botanist, and he soon joined Professor Torrey as junior author of the proposed Synoptical Flora of North America. In 1836 Gray published his Elements of Botany, the first of a long series of textbooks. He taught for a while at the University of Michigan, visited Europe, and in 1842 was appointed Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard, where he made is botanical mark on the world. In 1848 he published the first edition of his Manual which was in its 7th edition in 1914. He was a noted taxonomist, bringing some semblance of order out of the chaos which preceded him, and was also one of the first plant geographers. He was also a champion of Darwin and defended the theory of natural selection. Gray became friendly with Sir Charles Darwin in 1855, following a meeting with the scientist at Kew Gardens, Surrey, London, some years previously. In 1856, Darwin imparted to Gray some of his thoughts on evolution. Subsequent to the publication of the famous Origin of Species in 1860, Gray, ever the diplomat, wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker of the Linnaean Society that ""it is done in a masterly manner."" Later in correspondence with Darwin he wrote that ""I never learnt so much from a book as I have from yours."" The friendship flourished, although Gray's religious convictions prevented him from fully accepting the theory of evolution. Some years later Darwin dedicated his Forms of Flowers to his loyal American friend. For 10 years he was the president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1871 he was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He died in 1888, but his many works stand today as truly great contributions to American botany.  Last Chance for the Whitebark Mark Matthews, High Country News, 4 December 2000, www.hcn.org  Missoula, Montana: High atop Beaver Ridge on the Montana-Idaho border, a neglected tree species is making its last stand. Moss-adorned 60-foot-tall snags that were once thriving whitebark pine trees stand like ghosts in this forest now dominated by subalpine fir. Years ago, the pine with the cones that point skyward provided tons of big nutritious seeds that at least 110 different animal species, ranging from small birds and mice to grizzly bears, loved to eat. Now, the few solitary, centuries-old trees that still cling to life here and in the neighboring Bitterroot-Selway Wilderness are facing local extinction.  8   In Glacier National Park, the species is down to 5 percent of its historic range. In areas around Missoula, 60 percent to 80 percent of the trees have died. In the Bob Marshall Wilderness, trees are also dying at a fast clip. A tree is overlooked For decades, the stark gray snags crowding the ridgelines like moss-covered gravestones failed to ring an alarm. Ecologists first thought the massive die-offs were part of the tree's natural cycle. Timber scientists weren't very interested in the slow-maturing, low-value tree that grows at high elevations. The die-offs began in the 1930s, when mountain pine beetles swarmed through the forests, a natural cyclical phenomena. The tiny beetles dig egg chambers in the cambium of a tree. Under regular circumstances, whitebark pine would resist the beetles by clogging the egg chambers and entry holes with pitch. But the tree came under stress at the same time from an exotic disease from France called white pine blister rust. Fire ecologist Steve Arno first noted the massive decline in the 1960s. Arno eventually recruited Bob Keane, an ecologist with the Forest Service's Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Mont., to unravel the tree's ecological secrets. For four summers, Keane camped in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, observing an astounding relationship between the whitebark pine and its wildlife neighbors. Biologists had already recognized the tree as an important wildlife food source particularly for bears. Red squirrels cache the seeds, then bears pilfer those caches. Bears crave the oily seeds so much that, if offered the option, they will choose them over salmon. In Yellowstone National Park, whitebark pine seeds account for up to 48 percent of a grizzly bear's annual diet during a productive cone crop year. When the late summer seed crop is abundant, bears are rarely seen at low elevations. When the crop fails, there is always a dramatic increase in human-bear encounters in the valleys. Keane monitored an even more curious animal-tree relationship that was first brought to light by biologist Diana Tomback of the University of Colorado at Denver. Whitebark pine cones develop facing skyward and hold onto their seeds so that they never fall to the ground. There has never been a documented case of a seed germinating beneath a parent tree. Even if they could get free, the seeds do not have wings that would allow them to float to open areas. Instead, a feathered friend - the Clark's nutcracker - disperses the seeds. Come late summer, Clark's nutcracker will break open a cone, extract a mouthful of seeds and fly to an open area to bury them. Each bird picks up to 110,000 seeds every summer, hiding them in about 8,000 different spots. ""The bird is a caching machine,"" Keane says.  9   Either the bird can't remember all the locations of the caches, or it isn't hungry enough to eat all the seeds, because each bird ends up ingesting only about 85,000 seeds a year, giving the rest a chance to germinate. But the nutcracker doesn't hide its caches in any old clearing, Keane discovered. The seeds develop into trees only in disturbed soil, as in a recently burned area free from competition from other plants - which is the main reason why whitebark pine has not been able to rebound after its crises with disease and insects. ""Modern fire-suppression tactics over the last 80 years have stopped fires from reaching the high mountain tops where the tree lives,"" Keane says. Fire would not only prepare suitable caching areas, it would also keep the shadetolerant subalpine fir in check. ""When subalpine fir even see a fire, they just throw up their hands and lie down,"" Keane says. From his research in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, Keane estimates that subalpine fir now dominates 22 percent of the traditional whitebark pine habitat. Historically, the fir only grew in about 8 percent. ""Without fire, fir will overtake an area in three to four decades,"" he says. A complex prescription On Beaver Ridge, saw crews were busy last summer thinning firs from some areas to stimulate growth and cone production in whitebark pine, as well as clear-cutting 1- to 2-acre plots to create nutcracker caching sites. After setting prescribed burns, workers will replant some areas, and leave others to the nutcracker. But thinning and reseeding will prove fruitless in the future unless wildfire is allowed to return to the ecosystem, says Keane: ""The only way to perpetuate the species is to open up areas for caching. That means fire, because innovative methods like thinning and clear-cutting won't always work. First of all about 49 percent of the whitebark range is located in wilderness areas where you can't even use a chainsaw."" But there are major problems with prescribed, or controlled, burning. The time frame for prescribed burns at high altitudes is short because of heavy snows. Many sites can't even be reached by vehicle until mid-June. On Beaver Ridge, snow often tops the 22-foot-high weather tower long after spring arrives in the valleys. ""Usually, when the whitebark pine area comes into prescription, the lower forests are at a tinderbox dry condition,"" Keane says. ""The best treatment is to let wildfires in wilderness go at high elevations and drift upslope and burn themselves out at the tree line. And only control them if they come near people or property."" Keane will never live to see whether his efforts to save the whitebark pine are successful. It often takes 10 years before a burn site becomes conducive to whitebark seedling survival. Grasses and forbs must first create enough ground cover to hold soil moisture. Then it takes another 20 to 40 years before seedlings become functional trees. And then another 20 years before they start producing cones. But once they get established, trees that escape the rust, beetles and crown fires can ""live for a very long time,"" Keane says, often for centuries.

The tree, which grows to above 130 feet tall, has been christened unofficially the Nightcap Oak after its discovery in the Nightcap Range rainforest near Byron Bay, 400 miles north of Sydney. The tree's history spans more than 90 million years, back to when Australia was part of the Gondwanaland super-continent linked to what is now Antarctica, New Zealand and South America, said Dr Peter Weston of Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens. ``It's a very, very old lineage indeed,'' Weston told Reuters. Weston identified the new tree after a stand of about 20 mature trees was discovered by botanist Robert Kooyman in August. Weston said it was remarkable that such a unique tree could have gone unnoticed in a rainforest which has been well researched and documented by botanists. ``I was really amazed...this rainforest has been scoured to within an inch of its life by some very good botanists,'' he said. He said the tree belonged to the Proteaceae family, of which native Australian banksias, waratahs, macadamias and grevilleas and South Africa's proteas are members. Weston said the tree was a ``relatively non-descript'' rainforest tree with dark green leaves, nuts about the same size as macadamias -- a delicacy in Australia -- and small white flowers in dense clumps. Kooyman said the flowers smelled faintly of sweet aniseed. One of the larger trees in the Nightcap Range had a circumference of more than 29 inches. The exact location of the Nightcap trees is being kept a closely guarded secret so the trees can be protected. The New South Wales state government said it was considering a request to grant the tree emergency protection under the state's legislation covering threatened species. Cuttings from the trees have been taken and are being cultivated at Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens. Botanists were excited in 1994 by the discovery of Australian flora's first ``living fossil,'' the Wollemi Pine which dates back 150 million years. Weston said it was likely Australia, known for its unique wildlife which includes kangaroos and koala bears, probably still contained many species of undiscovered fauna. ``That something that big can escape detection until now...what small, interesting plants are there now that we know nothing about?,'' he said. FACTOID: The US Forest Service reports that it used 27 different herbicide formulations totaling 35,992.75 pounds for the control of noxious weeds in Fiscal Year 1997.  11   Reintroducing Hawaii's Silverswords Robert Robichaux, Steven Bergfield, Marie Bruegmann, Joan Canfield, Patrice Moriyasu, Tanya Rubenstein, Timothy Tunison, and Frederick Warshauer. Endangered Species Bulletin, May/June 2000  Of the many endangered plant species in the Hawaiian Islands, silverswords have the highest profile due to their radiant beauty and the severity of the threats confronting them. The large-scale reintroduction of greenhouse-grown seedlings is raising hopes for the recovery of these spectacular endemic species, although serious challenges remain. The Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense ssp. sandwicense) had an historic range that encircled Mauna Kea volcano at 8,500-12,500 feet (2,600-3,800 meters) elevation on the Island of Hawai'i. Based on records of early naturalists, this silversword grew in abundance and was a dominant plant of the subalpine ecosystems. In the late 1700s, European voyagers introduced sheep and other alien (nonnative) ungulates to the island. The alien animals spread rapidly, with the sheep population on Mauna Kea eventually exceeded 40,000. As alien ungulate populations increased, silverswords declined severely in distribution and abundance, presumably due to heavy browsing. The small natural population of silverswords that persists on Mauna Kea now contains only 42 plants, all of them confined to cliffs and rock faces that are inaccessible to ungulates. Mauna Loa silversword (Argyroxiphium kauense) suffered a similar fate. Historically, this species was common in moist to wet ecosystems between 5,000 and 8,900 feet (1,500 and 2,700 meters) on Mauna Loa and Hualalai volcanoes. Following the introduction and spread of pigs, mouflon sheep, and other alien ungulates, however, the Mauna Loa silversword suffered a severe decline. The surviving individuals, numbering fewer than 1,000 plants, are confined to three small natural populations widely scattered across Mauna Loa. In addition to direct threats from alien ungulates, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa silverswords may face serious indirect threats from alien insects, especially ants and wasps. These alien predators have the potential to decimate populations of native bees and moths that serve as pollinators, thereby greatly limiting seed set in silverswords. Partnership for Recovery Though the threats are daunting, the outlook for recovery of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa silverswords has brightened considerably in recent years. Key to this reversal of fortune has been a public/private partnership between the Volcano Rare Plants Facility , Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Hawaiian Silversword Foundation. The Rare Plant Facility has grown the large number of silversword seedlings destined for reintroduction, closely tracking the pedigree (or parentage) of each one. Different agencies in the partnership have then overseen the outplanting effort in different parts of the historical ranges. The non-profit Silversword Foundation has worked closely with all of the partners to facilitate the collaborative initiative. By sharing expertise, resources and enthusiasm, and by emphasizing on-theground actions, the partnership has made major strides recently with silversword reintroduction. In 1999, we outplanted more than 2,500 silverswords on Mauna Kea, bringing the total reintroduced population to about 4,000. (About 1,500 Mauna Kea silverswords were successfully outplanted by the Division of Forestry and Wildlife between 1973 and 12   1998.) We planted the seedlings at multiple sites in the State Forest Reserve. Survivorship has varied among the sites and with the time of planting, but has been exceptionally high in some cases. Of the 1,200 seedlings planted in late fall on the east slopes of Mauna Kea, for example, more than 99 percent have survived their critical first 9 months on the volcano. We also outplanted more than 1,000 silversword seedlings on Mauan loa and Hualalai in 1999. They went to protected sites in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Kulani Correctional facility, and State Forest Reserves. Again, survivorship has varied among the sites, but has exceeded 90 percent at some locations. To ensure high genetic diversity in the reintroduced silversword populations, we have implemented a controlled crossing program in which we hand-pollinate flowering silverswords in both the field and greenhouse to produce seeds. Although handpollinating the plants can be challenging at times, especially on Mauna Kea, where we must perch precariously on steep cliffs and rock faces, the program has enabled us to significantly increase the number of founders (or parents) for the reintroduction effort, and to balance their genetic representation among the seedlings that are outplanted. Over the next year, we plan to outplant another 2,000 silverswords on Mauna Kea and Hualalai. This, we will soon be about 40-60 percent of the way towards achieving our long-term goal of reintroducing more than 15,000 Mauna Kea and Muana Loa silverswords throughout their historical ranges. The major threat to the recovery of silverswords (and many other endangered plant species in Hawaii) continues to be alien ungulates. Even at low numbers, these animals can have severe impacts. On the upper slopes of Mauna Kea, for example, where alien ungulate populations have been greatly reduced by a court-ordered removal program, browsing still causes significant seedling mortality, and serious damage to adult silverswords, at some of the outplanting sites in 1999. Because alien ungulates are still abundant on Mauna Loa and Hualalai, all of our outplanting sites for Mauna Loa silverswords must be protected by fencing, which ultimately constrains the scope of the reintroduction effort. Alien insects may also continue to pose a significant threat to the health of native pollinator populations. The large-scale reintroduction strategy for silverswords, implemented through public/private partnership, highlights both the opportunities and challenges for recovery of other endangered plant species in Hawaii.  Progress Summary of Great Smoky Mountains National Park Spider Inventory Fred Coyle, Western Carolina University  Fred Coyle at Western Carolina University has been devoting nearly all of his research efforts since 1995 to an inventory of the spiders of great Smoky Mountains National Park. Most of the funding for the project has come from the National Science Foundation, but seed grants were also provided by Western Carolina University and the National Park Service. Although Coyle began this project before the Great Smokies All Taxa Biodiveristy Inventory (ATBI) plan was developed, the products of his inventory  13   project should contribute nicely to the ATBI goals. Here is a thumbnail sketch of the project (which will probably take three more years to complete) and results to date: The key objectives are to deermine whatspider species live in GSMNP and how they are distributed among the Park's habitats. The result will be distributed via the Internet vin the form of an electronic database (Biota), and a spider identification guide useful for testing ecological hypotheses and species richness estimators, facilitating further research on spiders, managing resources, and educating Park visitors. Coyle and his students have collected about 2380 samples (about 1930 1-hour ground, aerial, beat, and sweep samples and 450 1 meter square litter samples) containing an estimated 45,000 adult spiders from 17 intensively sample focal sites representative of 16 of the Park's major biotic community types and from numerous accessory sites representing additional habitats. The number of sample units per focal site ranges from 48 (spruce-fir) to 1112 (cove hardwood). Coyle's sampling protocol, a modified Coddington protocol, has been field tested in tropical and temperate forests and involves a team of collectors using four standardized methods that sample spidersin all microhabitats and vegetation strata except the forest canopy. The protocol yields large and statistically tractable replicate data sets which reflect the relative abundance of species in the sites and habitats studied and hopefully will provide comparable views of species richness, taxonomic composition, and guild structure across diverse communities and regions. To date, about 85% of the adult spiders have been sorted into morphospecies, about 40% of the adults have been identified, and 15% have been entered into the Biota database. The adults identified to date comprise 474 species, 38 of which (8%) appear to be undescribed). Four papers based on this inventory are in press and five others are in preparation. These papers include analysis of the habitat distribution patterns, life cycles, and behavior of some of the common and speciose spider genera in the park, descriptions of the spider assemblage structure of selected sites, and evaluations of the effectiveness of species richness estimators.

BARNEBY (1911-2000) From BEN 261, ex Barbara Thiers [bthiers@nybg.org], Taxacom@usobi.org  Dr. Rupert Charles Barneby, Curator Emeritus in The New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Systematic Botany and one of the Garden's most senior and distinguished scientists, died Tuesday, December 5. He was 89 years old. Barneby's association with The New York Botanical Garden spanned nearly a half century. He arrived as a visiting scholar in the 1950s and shortly thereafter accepted a staff position as Honorary Curator of Western Botany. He went on to become a Research Associate and an Editorial Consultant for Brittonia, the Garden's esteemed scientific journal covering systematic botany. A self-taught botanist, Barneby rose to become a world expert in Leguminosae (the bean family) and Menispermaceae (the moonseed family). He spent his career at the Garden curating and studying the world's best collection of New World Leguminosae.  14   Gregory Long, President of The New York Botanical Garden, said, ""Rupert Barneby was one of the most productive botanists of the twentieth century, a giant in the field of botanical research. Over the last half century, he has been an inspiring mentor, a meticulous scholar, and a creative editor who has made an enormous contribution to the botanical world. We at The New York Botanical Garden are indeed fortunate that his kind, generous, gentle manner graced our lives."" In 1999, the International Botanical Congress presented Barneby with its prestigious Millennium Botany Award for a lifetime of contribution to science. In 1980, he was the winner of the Henry Allan Gleason Award, an annual award from The New York Botanical Garden for an outstanding recent publication in the field of plant taxonomy, plant ecology, or plant geography. In 1989, the American Society of Plant Taxonomists awarded Barneby with the Asa Gray Award for his contributions to systematic botany. In 1991, The Garden honored Barneby by institutionalizing his legacy through the establishment of the Rupert C. Barneby Fund for Research in Legume Systematics. The Engler Silver Medal, botanical science's highest honor for publications, was awarded to Barneby in 1992 for his monographic work Sensitivae Censitae: A Revision of the Genus Mimosa Linnaeus (Mimosaceae) in the New World. Since the publication of his first botanical paper in 1941, Barneby published more than 6,500 pages of papers, monographs, and journals. Among his most influential works are Atlas of North American Astragalus; Daleae Imagines; Intermountain Flora, Volume 3, Part B; and Silk Tree, Guanacaste, Monkey's Earring: A Generic System for the Synandrous Mimosaceae of the Americas (3 Volumes). ""Rupert Barneby was an incredible scholar and one of the nicest people I have known. He was one of the most productive and erudite students of botany and horticulture on the staff of The New York Botanical Garden in its 109-year history. He will be remembered by thousands of colleagues for his uncommon generosity in sharing his inexhaustible knowledge and precise editorial skills. He has left an authoritative legacy of publications and will be sorely missed by botanists around the world,"" said Professor Sir Ghillean Prance FRS, VMH, the former Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Barneby was known for his talent for discovering or rediscovering rare and local species. In the course of his five decades of research, Barneby described and named over 1,100 different plant species new to science. A botanist is fortunate to have a new species of plant named in his honor. Barneby had not only 25 different species named after him, but also, three genera (groups of species sharing common characteristics, such as roses or oaks) of plants: Barnebya, Barnebyella, and Barnebydendron. Barneby was a member of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, the International Association for Plant Taxonomy, and the New England Botanical Club, and a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. ""Rupert Barneby was a great student of plants in the style of George Bentham and the other encyclopedic workers of the nineteenth century, who would tirelessly analyze all we knew about enormous groups of plants and reduce that knowledge to lucid prose, working day after day, month after month, and year after year. He always had time to encourage and help students and colleagues, giving them the benefit of his extraordinary classical education, friendly personality, and love for plants. He will be  15   greatly missed,"" said Dr. Peter Raven, Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and close friend and colleague. He lived among literati as easily as he did among scientists. Considered his close friends were W.H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Julian Huxley, and others. Rupert Barneby was born October 6, 1911, in Monmouthshire, England. He attended Cambridge University where he received his B.A. in History and Modern Languages in 1932. He came to the United States in 1937 and established permanent residency in 1941. In 1978, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science degree from The City University of New York. In accordance with his wishes, there will be no funeral. The Garden will hold a memorial celebration in January.  Banner Plant: Botrychium lunaria Each month, a different plant graces the banner of Lingua Botanica. This edition's Banner Plant image was submitted by Mary Stensvold, R10 Regional Botanist  This photo was taken in an upper beach meadow in the northern part of the Tongass National Forest. Common moonwort ferns are charismatic little plants that are often overlooked because of their small size and because they blend well with the texture and color of surrounding vegetation. Botrychium lunaria is one of about 30 species of Botrychium known in North America. They are distributed throughout the world, however they seem to be most common in the northern part of the northern hemisphere. The aboveground portion of the fern is comprised of two fronds, a fertile frond and a sterile frond. The sterile frond has fan-shaped to half-moon shaped paired pinnae. The name moonwort is derived from this characteristic half-moon shape. The fertile frond supports clusters of spherical sporangia. The stems of the two fronds are joined to form a common stalk. Plants range in size from 3 to 25 cm tall, and are often variable morphologically. This variability is most often seen in pinna size, shape, orientation, and margin shape. The plants pictured here are typical in size, pinnae number and morphology. Common moonworts grow in an array of habitats including sandy seashore meadows, fjellfields, well-drained meadows, abandoned fields, and roadsides. Common moonworts play magical roles in European folklore. It is said that they can open locks when used as a key, pull the shoes from horses that step on them, and cause people to become invisible.  16   Afterword: Homemade Holiday Gift Suggestion for Botanists (especially Idaho botanists...)  A Potato Bazooka Bob Simon's Backyard Ballistics website is http://www2.csn.net/~bsimon/backyard.html  You may want a couple of buddies to go in buying the material with you, or make 3 at the same time, as the pipe comes in 10 foot chunks. I bought all material at a local ""Home Depot"" for about $15. Note on choice of material: I have seen and heard of plans for spud guns using PVC pipe. In fact, an article in the February issue of ""Modern Gun"" uses PVC. I chose to use schedule 40 ABS plastic. The black pipe usually used for sewerage. If you want to know why I chose ABS, take a chunk of PVC pipe. Hit it with a 25 lb sledge hammer. It fragments into many *sharp* pieces. Try this with ABS. The sledge hammer bounces off the pipe and smashes into your foot. But it didn't break! (The pipe, that is, I don't know about your foot). PVC also gets brittle with exposure to sunlight. ABS just gets hot. Only ever use schedule 40! That's the thick stuff. It costs a little more, but not that much more. The bill of material says 10 foot lengths, only because that's as small a piece as is normally sold. Web master's note: There does seem to be some confusion about what pipe is safest to use. Finding pressure rated ABS pipe is nearly impossible in many areas. Most spud shooters are therefore constructed of PVC pipe. If you stick to conventional propellants and do not use oxidizers, PVC should perform with adequate safety.  Bill of material 1 10 foot piece of 2 inch diameter schedule 40 ABS pipe 1 10 foot piece of 3 inch diameter schedule 40 ABS pipe 1 3 inch to 2 inch reducing bushing 1 3 inch coupling 1 3 inch threaded (one side) coupling 1 3 inch threaded end-cap 1 can ABS solvent-weld pipe glue. NEVER USE PVC GLUE on ABS!!! 1 Coleman sparker - these are easily found in any sporting goods store that has a decent camping section. They are normally made for putting inside a Coleman lantern or stove so you don't need matches. Construction Step 1 - Cut the combustion chamber to size. Cut off a 14 inch section of the 3 inch diameter pipe. You don't need the rest of the 10 foot length, so save it for future bazookas, or make one with a couple of buddies splitting the cost. Step 2 - glue the 3inch to 2 inch bushing into one side of the 3 inch coupling, glue the other side of the coupling to one end of the 14 inch combustion chamber. Make sure the joints are clean first and be liberal with the glue. Step 3 - glue the threaded coupling to the other end of the combustion chamber (using the slip-joint side, obviously) make sure the glue doesn't run into the threads. Step 4 - Cut the ""barrel"" to size. Cut off a 36 inch (3 foot) length of the 2 inch pipe. Glue this into the other end of the bushing you've glued to the combustion chamber. You should now have the complete gun, but it's not ready for firing just yet.  17   Step 5 - Using a file, taper the ""muzzle"" for the last half an inch on the outside. This will serve to cut the potato as it's rammed in. Step 6 - You'll need to mount the sparker inside the end cap. If you got the Coleman one, it is threaded and has two nuts with it. There is also an angled piece of metal meant to hold the ignitor inside a lantern. Take the knurled knob off the end of the shaft. Be careful - there's an extra flint inside the knob. Unscrew the nut and discard the angled bit of metal. Drill a hole dead center in the ABS end cap of a diameter to take the shaft of the ignitor. Mount the ignitor inside the end cap, put the nut on the outside of the shaft and tighten until the ignitor is held in place. The shaft will slide back and forth, but won't come out. Put the end knob back on and tighten the lock screw. Step 7 - Make sure the glue has ""cured"". I left mine overnight before firing. Step 8 - make a ram rod. I used surplus 1/2 inch PVC pipe, 4 feet in length. A broom handle, etc. will do. Measure and make a mark about 2 feet 8 inches down the ram rod. To fire: remove end cap. Ram a potato from the muzzle end. The tapered end will cut the potato to size. Make sure it has a good seal as you ram it down with the ramrod. Ram to the mark you made. I've found most misfires happen when there are gaps between the potato and the barrel where gasses can escape. Spray 2 - 5 seconds worth of cheap hair spray (white rain, aqua net) I'd use an ""unscented"" one if you can, or the gun stinks after a few shots! Start at 2 seconds and build up! After the hair spray, quickly screw in the end cap. One twist of the ignitor knob sends the spud skyward! Saftey Once you shoot this, you'll see the potato comes out with enough force, you wouldn't want to be on the wrong side! Usual safety about pointing the muzzle etc. still apply. This is for fun only. I don't make any guarantee you won't blow your arse off. (You may laugh it off, however). Personally, I'd never use acetylene, starting fluid (ether), black powder, lighter fluid, gasoline etc. as a propellant, but you may not value your body parts as much . You can get 3 shots off a big spud. Partially baked ones are fun - they seal in better and shoot farther, but they do break up and the barrel is a mess to clean up afterwards. Clean up Soap and water. Push a small towel through (here's a case where it's OK to clean from the muzzle). I've been shooting mine since 12/94 and have been having a barrel of laughs. The spuds will go nearly 200 yards! I plan to make the ""220 swift"" variety by coupling a one inch barrel to the three inch combustion chamber. I wonder if you put the barrels on threaded couplings you could have interchangeable barrels. Sort of an ""Idaho Contender"".

Introduction         Balancing human needs with the health of the natural environment may          be the most pressing global concern of the twenty-first century. Yet the          environment has been a mainstream political issue for less than 40 years.          New York State’s history underscores the youth and rapid growth of          environmental affairs. This paper outlines some of the major events, leaders,          laws, and groups that brought the environment from obscurity to prominence          in New York. The paper is part of an effort to support those who identify          and collect relevant documents concerning environmental affairs in the          state. Its two goals are to organize the subject in the minds of its readers,          and to provide clues and inspiration for environmental document-hunters.         The history of environmental affairs in New York is the story of how          New Yorkers decided to use their natural resources, and how they still          struggle to use soil, timber, water, air, and wildlife in ways that do          not decrease their value. New York is a huge place for human settlement          -- it is larger than Greece and more than half the size of the United          Kingdom -- but European immigrants began spreading across the state only          about 200 years ago. In that relatively brief time, New Yorkers have developed          the state’s 976 miles of ocean coastline and dug 524 miles of State-maintained          canals. New Yorkers largely deforested their land within 100 years of          establishing the state; today, forests once again cover the majority of          the land, and the amount of forested land in New York is increasing. New          York farms were mostly subsistence operations in 1800, but today they          send $2.9 billion a year in products to market and spread over 7.3 million          acres.[2]          Slightly less than half of New York’s land is taken by metropolitan          areas. But large rural tracts are still appropriated for urban needs as          reservoirs, power plants, or dumps, often in the wake of bitter controversy.          And perhaps the most valuable open spaces in New York are also reserved          for city-dwellers: New York’s 261,000 acres of state parks and recreation          areas attract more than 64 million visitors and their spending money every          year.[3] As the old saying goes, 100 tourists equal the income from one          acre of potatoes, and the tourists are much easier picking.          Before 1870, most New Yorkers lived in rural areas. In that place and          time, ""nature"" was not seen as a park. It was an overwhelming          force sometimes viewed with awe, but most often with loathing. Early farm          and village residents may have appreciated wild forests, clean air, and          pure water, but their lives and property were regularly threatened by          wild animals, extreme temperatures, drought, and floods. Absorbed in a          daily struggle to make water, land, and timber yield essential food, shelter,          and fuel, the majority of early New Yorkers could not have understood          that nature would soon be viewed as a precious thing that needed protection.[4]         Appreciation of wilderness began in the cities, when men and women who          were separated from the struggle with nature began to see it as something          beautiful or sublime. New York City has been America’s largest urban          center since the 1790s, and its sophisticated residents led the nation’s          shift toward nature appreciation. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825          made New York the economic capital of North America, and it also eased          the journey of New Yorkers to western wonders like Niagara Falls. A few          decades later, railroads made it a simple matter to visit Lake George          or climb the peaks of the Adirondacks. But early nature fans did little          about the loggers, hunters, and farmers who were rapidly consuming the          state’s wild areas. Indeed, they often belonged to those groups themselves.          George Bird Grinnell, a founder of the National Audubon Society, was the          wealthy publisher of a hunting magazine based in New York City.[5]         Scientists were the first to argue that people should protect natural          resources out of self-interest. In 1864, George Perkins Marsh’s  Man          and Nature  introduced the idea that human activity can inflict permanent          damage on a landscape. Five years earlier, Darwin’s  On The Origin          of Species  argued that nature is a constantly-changing system with          an uncountable number of interacting parts, and that changing one part          of nature might change it all. Marsh, Darwin, and other early ecological          thinkers provided some of the intellectual fuel for political efforts          to control timber-cutting, regulate game hunting, and protect watersheds          . Political support also came from the growing ranks of wealthy camp owners,          middle-class tourists, physicians, and others who valued the therapeutic          aspects of wild nature. But the most powerful force for protection was          the New York Chamber of Commerce, whose members feared the long-term economic          consequences of rampant logging.          The campaign for forest protection bore fruit in the mid-1880s when the          state legislature created the Forest Preserve and hired game wardens.          It triumphed in 1894, when voters ratified the ""forever wild""          clause in the State Constitution. Over the next two decades, the Forest          Preserve’s defenders fought off repeated attempts to re-institute          logging and building. Yet much of the land they fought to protect had          already been cut over. Enormous fires caused by continued cut-and-run          logging on private land ravaged the new park. Game wardens struggled to          enforce the laws and were often frustrated. It took decades for deer,          beaver, and other game animals to recover from near-extermination.          The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by the ""conservation""          movement, which favored the scientific control of natural resources to          maximize sustained yields. The movement was lead by Theodore Roosevelt,          who published an article on the birds of Franklin County at the age of          19[6], and forester Gifford Pinchot, the son of a wealthy New York financier.          Conservation sciences made rapid progress in the young State University          of New York system, lead by the College of Agriculture at Cornell University.          The Roosevelt-Pinchot era also produced the first laws for the regulation          of New York’s water, timber, and wildlife. But conservation leaders          did not halt the widespread destruction of forests by poor logging practices          and fires, and they did not prevent the dumping of raw sewage into urban          waterways. While conservationists opposed the rampant mining of natural          resources, their main purpose was to promote the harvesting of nature.         In the 1920s, the drive to protect nature gained momentum when a huge          wave of New Yorkers began touring the countryside in their automobiles.          Outdoor recreation and the preservation of natural areas were always linked          in the minds of people like Roger Tory Peterson, the world-famous birder          who moved from Jamestown to New York City in his teens and became a new          member of the Bronx County Bird Club in the late 1920s.[7] In 1928, the          five-year-old Adirondack Mountain Club endorsed a policy that combined          advocacy in three areas: conservation, recreation, and education.[8] During          the Great Depression, state and federal assistance programs accelerated          the growth of state forests and parks, especially in central and western          New York. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Adirondack Mountain Club and others          scored several victories in the courts. Environmental activism grew slowly,          however, and it was largely restricted to one branch of small, mostly          male sporting clubs -- until the 1960s. Then, suddenly, everything changed.                 America’s mass acceptance of environmental ethics has been traced          to three social shifts. First, the rapid development of nuclear weapons          in the 1950s made it apparent that humans could destroy the planet; at          the same time, contamination from radioactive fallout was detected around          the globe. Second, advances in the natural sciences provided proof that          a relatively new concept -- pollution -- could inflict long-term damage          on natural systems. In 1962, the publication of Rachel Carson’s  Silent          Spring  in  The New Yorker  brought this message to the mainstream.          Third, the Apollo space program yielded images of the planet that made          Earth appear fragile, lovely, and small. After the first moon landing,          novelist and physicist C.P. Snow wrote: ""As a result of supreme technological          skill and heroism, we are faced not with the infinite but with the immovable          limits.""[9]         Between 1968 and 1978, memberships on file at the Manhattan headquarters          of The National Audubon Society increased from 88,000 to 388,000.[10]          Membership in the Adirondack Mountain Club tripled between 1965 and 1972.[11]          And on Earth Day 1970, Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed legislation          establishing the Department of Environmental Conservation, a powerful          bureaucratic machine charged with coordinating and strengthening all aspect          of natural resource protection and pollution control.         The ideas first advanced by Marsh and Darwin in the 1860s gained a sense          of urgency in the 1960s, super-charging the environmental movement. According          to historian Alfred W. Crosby, ""the new environmentalists wanted          to preserve as much of primordial nature as still existed because of its          intrinsic value, an almost religious yearning, and to defend an allegedly          damaged biosphere so that they human species might survive, a yearning          thrumming with anxiety.""[12]         Between 1970 and 2000, this new eco-centric philosophy made rapid inroads          among the public and elected officials. A majority of Americans now say          they worry ""a great deal"" about water, air, ocean, and soil          pollution, according to the Gallup Organization. But most Americans also          say they are ""somewhat satisfied"" with environmental protection          measures,[13] a reflection of the government’s progress in this area.          Meanwhile, science is accumulating more and more evidence that human activities          are permanently changing nature on a global scale. The cycle is clear:          scientists and naturalists sound alarms, activists take up causes, the          public demands change, politicians reform laws, and the furor abates until          a new alarm sounds.          Today, the focus of environmental affairs in New York is increasingly          global and relentlessly local. As the home of more than 100 non-governmental          organizations dedicated to environmental protection, including the United          Nations, New York remains at the forefront of environmental thinking and          action[14] on global issues. Leading-edge New York activists are exploring          the links between environmental damage and consumer spending, population          growth, climate change, and poverty. As environmental thinking spreads          throughout society, new areas of concern are emerging. A growing number          of executives support sustainable or ""green"" business practices,          for example. The sprawling growth of suburban communities is a major concern          in Rochester, Long Island, and other areas. ""Environmental justice""          activists fight against the disproportionate effect of pollution on the          poor. Those who are alarmed at the pervasive spread of environmental affairs          have even formed groups to fight the pollution fighters.          But to the vast majority of New Yorkers, environmental issues are not          global -- they are intensely local. Environmental affairs means the successful          campaign to prevent construction of a nuclear power plant on Cayuga Lake;          the clean-up of Love Canal and other toxic waste sites in Erie and Niagara          Counties; and the struggle to prevent a regional dump from opening near          the tiny Lewis County hamlet of Harrisville.

As in 1900, environmental affairs in New York is mostly the story of          well-educated city dwellers insisting on changes that have the greatest          impact on rural residents. Like a century ago, the political support for          environmental reform is based on popular interpretations of scientific          research, interpretations that are sometimes incomplete or wrong. But          unlike 1900, environmental organizations are now found in every corner          of New York, and officials in the most rural townships are now required          to consider the environmental impacts of their actions.          Every year, hundreds of New York organizations, from the World Environment          Center (in Manhattan) to the Chautauqua County Environmental Management          Council (in Jamestown) create boxes upon boxes of records. Every year,          hundreds of state and local laws are passed on behalf of New York’s          environment, and each new law is preceded by a trail of documents. The          following essay is intended to be a guide to the ideas that underlie New          York’s vast infrastructure for environmental protection . Think of          it as a map for those who want to find their way through the wilderness          of environmental records.          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         2. Before 1895: Discovering Nature                                 ""In Europe people talk a great deal of the wilds of America,              but the Americans themselves never think about them; they are insensible              to the wonders of inanimate nature and they may be said not to perceive              the mighty forests that surround them till they fall beneath the hatchet.              Their eyes are fixed upon another sight, the . . . march across these              wilds, draining swamps, turning the course of rivers, peopling solitudes,              and subduing nature.""             --Alexis DeTocqueville,  Democracy in America , from a trip              in 1831             ""The lands of the State [of New York], now owned or hereafter              acquired, constituting the Forest Preserve as now fixed by law, shall              be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold,              or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor              shall the timber thereon be sold, removed, or destroyed."" --              New York State Constitution Article VII, Section 7, ratified in 1894                           The earliest American settlers often spoke in fearful tones of the wild          lands that surrounded them. William Bradford reported that he stepped          off the Mayflower in 1627 to a ""hideous and desolate wilderness.""          For more than two centuries, his co-travelers in America regarded wild          nature with revulsion, while they saw Western civilization as the world          God intended. William Cooper, a settler in northern New York in the late          1700s, wrote that his ""great primary object"" was ""to cause          the Wilderness to bloom and fructify."" When nature was written about          in favorable tones, the praise was almost always couched in terms of rural          husbandry, not wilderness. Early landscape painters commonly showed farm          scenes with forest edges in the background, as if nature had been pushed          into submission by the righteous farmer.[15]         By the end of the Nineteenth Century, this attitude has been turned on          its head. Loggers, hunters, and farmers began the century being portrayed          as heroes in the battle against the dark wilderness; they ended it as          ""pirates of the forest""[16] who plundered a defenseless Mother          Nature. New York voters came to believe in protection so strongly that          in 1894, they approved a new clause in the state Constitution designating          hundreds of thousands of state-owned land ""forever wild.""          Two movements were at the root of this reversal. The first was a broad          shift in public attitudes. Early in the century, a few artists and writers          in Europe and New York City began portraying wilderness as a treasure          unique to America. Near mid-century, urban design experts and physicians          in New York and Boston began prescribing fresh air, sunshine, and the          solitude of wide-open spaces for illnesses that ranged from consumption          to insanity. Sanitariums were built in pastoral settings, including a          vast mental hospital on Seneca Lake and a tuberculosis treatment center          in Saranac Lake. Belief in the positive benefits of wild landscapes had          become mainstream by 1883, when Niagara Falls became America’s second          state park, and was confirmed in 1885, when the state created its Forest          Preserve. During the latter part of the century, naturalists and moral          philosophers even began arguing that mankind had an obligation to treat          wild birds and animals in a humane manner -- and that nature had a right          to exist that was separate from mankind.         The second movement was based in science and economics. New York’s          virgin forests were cut down rapidly and brutally, with severe side effects.          In the 1860s, so much of the state had been poorly logged that erosion          was pouring silt into the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers, threatening a transportation          network that was vital to New York City. In 1864, George Perkins Marsh          gave voice to the growing concern. In his book  Man and Nature ,          Marsh argued that many ancient civilizations had failed because they stripped          the earth bare with little regard for the future[17]. The book became          a central rallying point for those who believed that uncontrolled logging          would ruin the state. Severe fires in the logged-over land, many caused          by cinders from passing trains, deepened the sense of alarm. In the end,          the successful campaign for the Forest Preserve depended on a rare alliance          between nature-lovers, physicians, and the Chamber of Commerce.          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         From Hell to Heaven         European intellectuals who visited the new United States sometimes echoed          the early American settlers’ disdain for wild lands. But other visitors          who followed the Romantic tradition were entranced by the vast empty spaces          of the New World. Rene de Chateaubriand, who spent part of the winter          of 1791-2 in northern New York, wrote that the absence of roads, towns,          laws, and kings filled him with ""a sort of delirium . . . in this          deserted region the soul delights to bury and lose itself amidst boundless          forests.""[18]         Upper-class New Yorkers were the first to see Chateaubriand’s point          of view. In 1830, Manhattan and Brooklyn had a combined population nearing          300,000. During that decade, the area around New York Harbor surpassed          Mexico City to become the largest and wealthiest urban center in the New          World.[19] Sheltered from the wild in their offices and drawing rooms,          the city’s elite began seeking enlightenment in the Romantic manner.          Charles Fenno Hoffman, editor of  American Monthly Magazine , found          a ""singular joyousness in a wilderness"" and added, ""I have          felt among some scenes a kind of selfish pleasure, a wild delight, that          the spot so lovely and so lonely. . . bloomed alone for me."" In 1836,          Hoffman published ""Wild Scenes Near Home: or Hints for a Summer Tourist,""          essentially the first travel article about the Adirondacks.[20]          Many reporters followed Hoffman into regions of the state that were still          beyond the reach of all but the most determined traveler, and the reading          public developed an appetite for tales of wilderness adventure. In 1849,          New York  Tribune  reporter Joel T. Headley announced that the great          woods were ""better for me than the thronged city, aye, better for          soul and body both."" He promised that anyone with ""a love for          the wild, and free"" could enjoy an Adirondack vacation ""and          come back to civilized life a healthier and better man.""[21]         As the city’s population exploded in the 1830s, the quality of its          air and water deteriorated. A wave of immigrants from Ireland and Germany          quickly overwhelmed low-income neighborhoods near the mills and wharves.          In 1842, a landmark public health report by a local physician, John H.          Griscom, cited tenements where 50 people shared a single privy, and basement          apartments that were ""living graves for human beings.""[22] Conditions          in upper-class neighborhoods were not as bad, however, and decision-makers          ignored the problem until a cholera epidemic seized the city in the summer          of 1849. Over 5,000 died in Manhattan. Many of the wealthy fled for the          fresh air and clean water of surrounding countryside. It is likely that          many of them waited out the plague while reading a wilderness novel by          James Fenimore Cooper.          Between 1823 and 1841, starting with  The Pioneers  and continuing          with the series  Leatherstocking Tales , Cooper wrote searchingly          about the wilds of New York and the men who lived in them. Cooper’s          hero, Natty Bumpo, was a mouthpiece for the Romantic belief in the sanctity          of the wild. But Bumpo went further, also saying that the woods bred honest          men while city-dwellers were prone to decadence. Bumpo’s speeches          made Cooper into a national literary hero. But later interpreters have          pointed out the author’s personal belief that civilization was inevitable          and the loss of wilderness a tragic necessity. Cooper saw the transition          from wilderness to civilization as the conflict of two moral goods, with          civilization prevailing.[23]         Painters, like popular writers, had a great influence on popular attitudes          early in the Nineteenth century. Before photography was widely available,          the most prominent American artists put their newly-completed canvases          on public display in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, often stimulating          intense debate. A particularly influential movement in landscape painting          began in 1825, when an unsuccessful Ohio portrait painter named Thomas          Cole began hiking into the Catskills with sketchbook in hand. Cole continued          producing increasingly popular wilderness scenes, and the Hudson River          School he founded grew in importance after his death in 1848.         Cole’s canvases represented a basic change in attitude. He portrayed          wild land that was under assault from settlers, and in the writing that          accompanied his work he bemoaned the vanishing wilderness. One of his          students, Frederick Church, eventually produced canvases that showed no          trace of human activity whatsoever. Another student, Ashur B. Durand,          wrote to his colleagues in 1855 that they should not go abroad, but paint          America first: the ""untrodden wilds, yet spared from the pollutions          of civilization, afford a guarantee for a reputation of originality that          you may elsewhere long seek and find not.""[24]          The belief that pastoral settings were needed for health and well-being          became public policy in 1858, when 840 acres of pig pens and sheep pastures          were converted into a park for New York City. After years of delay and          political log-rolling, the design contract for Central Park was awarded          to Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Central Park was a departure          from most urban parks of the day, which were organized around marching          grounds, playing fields, or race tracks. In contrast, Olmsted and Vaux          wanted to give rich and poor a respite from the frantic, filthy city.          They produced a natural-seeming landscape of curving drives and meandering          paths. Visitors were presented with a series of artfully arranged pastoral          landscapes that encouraged them to contemplate nature.         Olmsted was also among the first Americans to call for the preservation          of wild land for its aesthetic qualities. In 1863, he wrote a report for          the California legislature on the uses of Yosemite Valley, which would          become the nation’s first state park a year later. Once again, he          argued for the therapeutic benefits of wilderness: ""The enjoyment          of scenery employs the mind without fatigue and yet exercises it; tranquilizes          it and yet enlivens it; and thus, through the influence of the mind over          the body, gives the effect of refreshing rest and reinvigoration of the          whole system.""[25]          Olmsted’s recommendation to leave Yosemite alone was well ahead          of its time. He was ignored by the legislators, who soon allowed sheep          to gnaw the Valley’s pristine grasses. Yet his words had a lasting          effect on those who heard them, and the influential designer continued          to advance his point of view. He was a leader in the campaign to protect          the Adirondacks. He was also instrumental in the creation of New York’s          first state reservation at Niagara Falls, a public purchase made to save          the falls from private developers.[26]         Other prominent Americans also spoke in praise of untouched nature. In          1858, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s poem ""The Adirondacks"" memorialized          his trip to the Philosophers’ Camp, a getaway for wealthy and prominent          men established by William J. Stillman at Follensbee Pond. In 1857, Paul          Smith settled in the area that now bears his name and began building the          hotel empire that brought thousands more into the northern woods. Throughout          the 1860s and 1870s, rail lines extended further into previously inaccessible          areas. In 1869, a tourism craze was triggered by the publication of the          Rev. William H. H. Murray’s  Adventures in the Wilderness .          And in 1871, a Catskill farmer named John Burroughs published his first          essay. Over the next 50 years, Burroughs and his Western counterpart,          John Muir, would become celebrity spokesmen for the sanctity of nature[27]            .         Burroughs became well-known for his artfully written descriptions of          the birds, insects and flora near his Delaware County farm, and from a          nearby cabin he named Slabsides. He entertained hundreds of prominent          visitors at the farm, traveled the country, and even took camping trips          with industrialists like Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and Henry Ford.          Yet his writing also contained pleas for nature-worship that became more          radical as his popularity increased. In 1920, a year before his death,          he wrote: ""When we call the power back of all ‘God,’ it          smells of creeds and systems of superstition, intolerance, persecution;          but when we call it Nature, it smells of spring and summer, of green fields          and blooming groves, of birds and flowers and sky and stars.""[28]         New Yorkers were also in the forefront of the movement to extend some          legal protection to animals. In 1866, Henry Bergh organized the American          Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and drafted a          ""Declaration of the Rights of Animals"" to support the cause.          Bergh, a wealthy former diplomat, wrote and pushed a law through the New          York legislature that forbade all cruelty to animals, domestic and wild.          He also enlisted Henry Ward Beecher, the most prominent clergyman of the          day, to endorse his mission, which Beecher defined as advancement of ""the          rights of animals.""[29]          While the Humane movement did not have any explicit connection to environmental          affairs, it was still an important development. As historian Roderick          Nash notes, humane activists like Bergh ""deserve credit for making          the first stumbling steps away from a definition of moral community that          began and ended with human beings.""[30]          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         From Cholera To Clean Water         Industrial capitalism presented New Yorkers with a paradox: while it          brought economic prosperity that improved their lives, it pushed them          farther away from silent forests, clear streams, and other pleasures of          the natural world. Also, the explosive growth of factories meant equally          rapid growth in low-wage housing nearby. This concentrated age-old problems          of waste and disease into urban areas, where weak local governments were          reluctant to confront them. In the mid 1850s, for example, Manhattan’s          Common Council passed a law requiring that all residences be connected          to sewer lines. Several years later, only about one-quarter of the city’s          paved streets had sewers. Two-thirds of New Yorkers still used privies          in 1857, and most of the poor still relied on public wells that were frequently          contaminated. Cholera and typhus epidemics struck again in 1852 and threatened          the city regularly. Between 1850 and 1860, the survival rate for children          under the age of five in the city was less than 50 percent, a figure equal          to the worst slums of England.[31]         Physicians could do little about urban epidemics until a dramatic victory          in New York demonstrated the connection between health and sanitation.          In 1892, another outbreak of cholera that had already devastated Europe          faced the city. Reacting quickly, Common Council established a Division          of Pathology, Bacteriology, and Disinfection. The new department was directed          by Dr. Hermann Biggs, a native New Yorker raised in Ithaca and educated          Cornell. Biggs promoted the view of German bacteriologist Robert Koch          that communicable diseases could be prevented by eliminating germs. He          dispatched teams that scrubbed the homes of cholera patients and treated          or burned their clothes and bedding. His staff also flushed and disinfected          39,000 tenements. When the epidemic eased, only nine had died in Manhattan.          The triumph began an era of municipal leadership in preventative medicine,          including the first real efforts to protect the quality of urban air and          water.[32]          Outbreaks of cholera and other diseases also drove the development of          municipal water and sewer systems in rapidly-growing upstate cities. These          were typically expensive and difficult undertakings. In Rochester, for          example, a 16-mile aqueduct from Hemlock Lake was authorized in 1852,          in the wake of a severe epidemic. The system did not begin operating until          1876, however, and health concerns continued even after the cleaner water          came on line. Eventually the city bought and condemned the entire shorelines          of Hemlock and neighboring Canadice, the two westernmost Finger Lakes,          to reduce contaminants in the water. Hotels, cottages, and farmsteads          were purchased and razed beginning in 1895, and the lakes have been off-limits          to all but a few recreational uses since then.[33]          In New York, Hermann Biggs moved on to more successes against diphtheria          and typhoid. He also made dramatic improvements in deaths from tuberculosis,          ""the great white plague"" that had steadily killed more than          6,000 Manhattan residents a year.[34] Because tuberculosis was a steady          killer, it did not get as much attention as epidemic diseases. Yet its          high toll meant that thousands of families, rich and poor, were caring          for loved ones with consumption.          Desperate for anything that would help, some TB patients responded to          the call originally issued in Reverend Murray’s 1869 best-seller          on the Adirondacks: ""I predict that the wilderness will be more and          more frequented by invalids, as accommodations are provided for their          reception and comfort, and that the region will become the resort for          thousands each year seeking restoration to health.""[35]         One of these invalid travelers was Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau, a young          Manhattan doctor who was near death from tuberculosis. In the summer of          1873, Trudeau was carried into Paul Smith’s hotel, and the man who          carried him remarked that he weighed ""no more than a dried lambskin.""          Three months later, he returned to New York much improved. The following          year, he moved his family to the Adirondacks permanently and settled in          Saranac Lake, a cluster of 50 crude log and wood homes at an elevation          of 1,500 feet.         Like Biggs, Trudeau was intrigued by the ideas of Robert Koch, He also          followed the work of Hermann Brehmer, the first physician to treat tuberculosis          in a sanitarium that emphasized rest, fresh air, and the regulation of          the patient’s life and habits. Trudeau duplicated Koch’s experiments          in a crude laboratory, and in 1894 he established a one-room sanitarium          in Saranac Lake. Trudeau’s results were much better than those achieved          by doctors in the city. Patients began to pour in, and wealthy summer          residents organized fairs to support them. Within a decade, the village          of Saranac Lake had been reborn as a sanitarium for consumptives who came          to be cured in the cold, dry air of the mountains.          Saranac Lake was a late example of a statewide trend to treat serious          chronic illness by placing the afflicted in pastoral settings. In 1842,          the New York State Lunatic Asylum in Utica opened with landscaped grounds          in a rural area west of Utica. In 1853, the nation’s first asylum          for the cure of alcoholism opened on a bluff overlooking the Chenango          and Susquehanna Rivers, near Binghamton. And beginning in 1865, the Willard          State Hospital operated as a planned rural community on the east shore          of Seneca Lake. It eventually became home to about 3000 people, 2000 of          whom were incurably insane.          Patients at Willard were soothed by the beautiful Finger Lakes farm country          that surrounded them. ""The proximity of the lake, with its bright          sparkling water...exercises a beneficial and tranquilizing influence upon          the disturbed and excited people whose home is, and for their lives shall          be, this Willard asylum, on the banks of the sylvan lake,"" wrote          superintendent John Chapin in 1871.[36]          The opinions of physicians like Trudeau and Chapin helped solidify the          public’s belief that human health was enhanced by clean water and          fresh air, and that mental health was aided by access to rural tranquillity.          This belief, which was especially strong in urban areas, fueled the drive          to protect open lands across the state. It was first expressed as public          policy in the Adirondacks.[37]         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Fate of the Forests         The first real victory for the environmental movement in New York was          hard-fought, and the environmentalists won mainly because of support from          business leaders. It was a legislative victory that protected large areas          from logging and development, but a partial one: nine more years passed          before the law was placed above politics and enforced, and many of the          protected lands had already been logged. Yet the creation of the State          Forest Preserve was significant in several ways. It was the first time          several diverse groups came together to pass environmental legislation          at the state level. It was one of the first times that state law-makers          were persuaded by the opinions of naturalists and scientists. Most significant,          it established the precedent that protecting water, soil, and timber resources          were public goals that could override private property rights.          In the 1870s, old-growth timber lands owned by New York State were being          sold to loggers for 70 cents an acre, and the state paid a bounty to hunters          who brought in the skulls of wolves and panthers. Yet there were signs          that these policies had gone on too long. Commercial-grade white pine,          the most prized of lumber woods, was nearly gone by 1870. Spruce was being          cut rapidly, and the bark of old-growth hemlock trees was being stripped          for use in tanning factories, causing the deaths of the trees. In the          eastern Adirondacks, the voracious need of iron smelters for fuel led          to ruinous clear-cutting. As the paper industry gradually shifted its          raw material from rags to wood pulp, more land was clear-cut. The state          led the nation in the production of lumber in 1850, but over-cutting and          fires caused it to drop to fourth place in 1880 and seventeenth place          by 1900.[38]          The first call to preserve the north woods came from Samuel Hammond,          an Albany lawyer whose annual camping trips into the Adirondacks began          in the 1840s. In 1857, decrying the ""greed for progress"" that          measured all things in terms of economic value, Hammond said that he would          ""mark out a circle of a hundred miles in diameter, and throw around          it the protecting aegis of the constitution."" The land, he said,          would be best kept as ""a forest forever.""[39]          Hammond’s view was typical of urban visitors to the north woods          who expected pristine wilderness but found something very different. Seven          years later, the call for some kind of regulation of Adirondack lands          came from the heart of the Manhattan establishment. An editorial in the          August 9, 1864  New York Times  commented on the planned rail link          from Saratoga to North Creek by saying, ""the Adirondack region will          become a suburb of New York. The furnaces of our capitalists will line          its valleys and create new fortunes to swell the aggregate of our wealth,          while the hunting lodges of our citizens will adorn its more remote mountain          sides and the wooded islands of its delightful lakes. It will become,          to our whole community, on an ample scale, what Central Park is on a limited          one..."" The  Times  continued by exhorting New Yorkers to ""form          combinations, and seizing upon the choicest of the Adirondack Mountains,          before they are despoiled of their forests, make of them grand parks,          owned in common...""[40]          The  Times  editorial had a significant effect, and the public started          to talk about a park. Yet the  Times  had endorsed the development          of the Adirondacks as a multi-use region, not as a preserve marked ""forever          wild"" in the state constitution. The journey to ""forever wild""          took thirty years, with many twists and strange turns along the way.          When the editorial ran, the only state agency dealing with natural resources          was the New York State Land Commission, which had been established in          1779 to sell off excess property. The state’s first purchase of land          did not happen until 1866, when it bought 700 acres of timber in Clinton          County to ensure a supply of wood for the prison system. Land was added          to the state’s holdings regularly, however, when it was reclaimed          because of unpaid taxes. Most of the tax-delinquent land had been abandoned          after logging for choice species such as white pine and spruce. Often          the ""cut-over"" state lands retained a lot of timber, and hunters          and trappers roamed freely between public and private land. As the years          went by and logging accelerated, more lands were left to the state.         Tourism to the north woods increased sharply in the 1860s and 1870s,          as the editorial had predicted, and sections of the mountains became pleasure          grounds for the gentry. Typical of these visitors were the Roosevelts,          who first made the trip from their Long Island mansion to Paul Smith’s          Hotel in 1871. In his journal of that summer, 12-year-old Theodore Roosevelt          wrote that he fell asleep while his father read aloud from  The Last          of the Mohicans  by the light of a campfire.[41]          In the spirit of excess that was the Gilded Age, wealthy summer visitors          demanded more and more from their Adirondack properties. They were served          by William West Durant, son of a wealthy Adirondack landowner and railroad          builder, who created a new architectural style. In 1876, Durant built          the first ""great camp"" at Pine Knot, beginning a style of grand          residences made of rustic materials like whole logs and native stone.          Year-round residents were often employed as laborers and guides, thereby          fueling the mythology of Adirondack craft-makers and woodsmen. The locals          also worked in great inns like the 1882 Prospect House at Blue Mountain          Lake, the first hotel in the world to provide electric lights in every          room.[42]          The north woods of New York were being used more extensively by many          different groups, and concerns grew that ordinary citizens were losing          a birthright. These concerns sharpened when consortiums of wealthy men          began buying huge tracts of scenic land. In 1876, the Adirondack Club          purchased several mountains, lakes, and valleys in the vicinity of Mount          Marcy. Over the next two decades, other large purchases by groups like          the Adirondack Mountain Reserve and the Adirondack League Club raised          the prospect that wilderness recreation might soon become a pastime only          for the rich.          Also in the 1870s, mainstream New Yorkers noticed that unregulated private          land uses could create significant public nuisances. In 1872 and other          years, cinders from passing railroads ignited the accumulated brush from          recently logged lands, causing huge fires. White-tailed deer, bear, and          beaver were being exterminated in all but the most remote areas. Also,          a drought cycle that peaked in 1883 created the popular impression that          fires, erosion, and logging were drying up the land, just as George Perkins          Marsh had warned in  Man And Nature.  Marsh made a crucial connection          when he argued that a society’s economic growth depended on the protection          of its wild land, and his book became a staple for preservationists.[43]         One of the most persuasive voices for protection was Verplanck Colvin,          a flamboyant surveyor who produced the first maps and detailed descriptions          of various Adirondack peaks. Borrowing from Marsh, Colvin liked to refer          to the north woods as a ""hanging sponge."" In an 1872 speech          to the Albany Institute, Colvin said, ""It has been proposed that          the state reserve this region as a Wilderness Park for sportsmen, but          that it a slight matter in comparison with the reservation of it as a          timber preserve, and as the grand reservoir region of the cities of the          valley of the Hudson.""          The water argument was to prove decisive to the parks’ creation.          In the mid-Nineteenth Century, freight traffic through the Erie Canal          may have been the most important reason for New York State’s dominance          of the North American economy. Without enough fresh water to float barges          through the canal and Hudson, New York City would falter -- as it did,          briefly, when water levels dropped dangerously in 1883. Even more important          was ensuring clean drinking water for the expanding metropolis. Manhattan          had drawn water from the Croton River through aqueducts since 1866 and          had long-range plans to look even further upstate. Yet neighboring cities          had to depend on increasingly uncertain sources. By the end of the century,          Brooklyn was running out of fresh water. Access to Manhattan’s aqueduct          was one of the factors that lead the five boroughs to merge, creating          the present boundaries of New York City in 1896.[44]         Thanks to the water issue, the chorus of nature tourists, naturalists,          and physicians who supported the Adirondack Park was joined by a powerful          fourth presence: the state Chamber of Commerce. In 1883, the Chamber’s          President was Morris Jesup, an ardent naturalist and social reformer who          was also the President of the American Museum of Natural History. At a          meeting late in the year, Jesup proposed that the state use its power          of eminent domain to set aside ""perhaps 4,000,000 acres . . . for          all time as a great forest preserve.""[45] Money talks. A law establishing          the State Forest Preserve was passed within 18 months.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         The Forest Preserved         As supplies of wood, wildlife, and water ran low, the state began investigating          what it would take to sustain them. In 1862, the Morrill Act enabled states          to sell public lands to finance land-grant universities, which were to          teach agriculture and the mechanical arts. Cornell University was established          as New York’s land-grant college in 1865, and it quickly became a          national center for the study of forestry and the natural sciences. In          1868, the state established a Fisheries Commission to study the impact          of logging on fish and water supplies. And in 1872, the state created          a Commission of State Parks and asked its members to evaluate the idea          of a large public park in the north woods.         One of the Commissioners was Verplanck Colvin. Another was Franklin B.          Hough of Lowville, the first native-born American forester. Hough was          a renaissance man -- a country doctor, historian, and naturalist who also          directed the state census in 1865 and the federal census in 1870. Hough’s          study of lumber statistics convinced him that the state faced disaster,          and he became interested in the scientific work of foresters in Europe.          In 1873, the Commission’s report combined Colvin’s prose with          the ideas of Marsh and Hough. They recommended a park that would be managed          not as wilderness but as a working forest, with controlled logging and          replanting. Although the report was initially ignored by the legislature,          Colvin took its conclusions to various groups and relentlessly lobbied          the public for support.          Meanwhile, Hough patiently worked from the inside. He sought state protection          of forests at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement          of Science in 1873, and the AAAS responded by appointing him chair of          a committee for forest protection. Three years later, Hough was appointed          the first Forestry Agent of the US Department of Agriculture. He completed          an influential  Report Upon Forestry  in 1877 and published the first          guide for American landowners,  The Elements of Forestry , in 1885.[46]         Slowly the tide began to turn toward protection. After a decade of debate          and continued logging, the State Legislature prohibited the further sale          of state lands in ten Adirondack counties in 1883. Also in that year,          Governor Grover Cleveland and the Legislature established the Niagara          Reservation. The land around Niagara Falls was purchased by the state          and reserved from private development in 1885, creating New York’s          first state park.          Early in 1884, after a vigorous campaign by Morris Jesup and the Chamber          of Commerce, the State Legislature established a commission to ""investigate          and report on a system of forest preservation."" The head of the commission          was Charles Sargent, a Harvard professor and early advocate of scientific          forestry. Sargent was doubtful that the state could manage the north woods          well, and favored a policy of preservation while the forests recovered.          His Commission proposed a law creating a forest preserve in 1885.          By this time, the press was regularly publishing accounts of a landscape          being utterly destroyed by relentless logging. Two engravings published          in  Harper’s Weekly  on December 6, 1884 were typical: one showed          a rushing mountain stream protected by towering trees and captioned, ""A          Feeder of the Hudson -- As it Was."" Next to it was a dry streambed          straddling slopes of charred stumps and captioned, ""A Feeder of the          Hudson - As It Is."" Accompanying the illustrations was an article          by Sargent warning that continued logging would reduce the Adirondacks          ""to the condition of a desert.""[47] Opposition to the park was          strong among upstate loggers and farmers. Grover Cleveland also opposed          the law, claiming that the land would revert to the state anyway after          it was logged. But scientific, social welfare, and business interests          were allied, and New York City was solidly in favor of the bill.         On May 15, 1885, the Adirondack And Catskill Forest Preserves were signed          into law by Governor David B. Hill. The legislation provided for a three-member          Forest Commission, hired wardens, required railroads to take actions to          prevent fires, and stipulated that the state would pay the taxes on Forest          Preserve lands that were due to local governments. Following Sargent’s          recommendation, the law also said that ""All the lands now owned or          which may hereafter be acquired by the State of New York . . . shall be          forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be sold, nor shall they          be leased or taken by any person or corporation, public or private.""                 But the law proved hollow. Logging continued, wardens were routinely          ignored, and private clubs continued to buy land at inflated prices. Forest          Commissioner Theodore Basselin, a Lewis County lumber baron, even used          his position to exclude lands he owned from the park, creating a series          of scandals that seemingly confirmed Sargent’s fears.          Even an important environmental advance sometimes happens for mercenary          reasons, and this was the case in the Catskill Forest. The Sargent Commission’s          57-page report dismissed the entire region in a single paragraph and recommended          against adding it to the Preserve. But Cornelius Hardenburgh, an assemblyman          from Ulster County, deftly put about 34,000 county-owned acres in his          district into the package just before Governor Hill signed the bill. Hardenburgh          was not a conservationist, but he was an ardent opponent of taxes, and          Ulster County had owed $40,000 in taxes to the state for those acres.          His move wiped out the debt, created a perpetual revenue source for Ulster          County, and -- as an afterthought -- began a park that now encompasses          more than 1,100 square miles.[48]         The decree said that the new Forest Preserve was ""wild land,""          but it took a decade for cultural and political changes to catch up to          the law. The new Adirondack Preserve was 681,374 acres widely scattered          over eleven counties, and many of those acres had already been logged.          Private lands in the region were unaffected by the law, and logging there          reached a peak between 1890 and 1910. The new frenzy for logging was due          to a technological innovation: the substitution of wood pulp for rags          in paper-making. Almost any kind of tree could make pulp, so lands that          had recently been harvested for hardwood were logged again for spruce          and other species, often leaving little behind. Timber corporations and          wealthy sportsmen continued to consolidate their holdings, so that more          and more land was owned by fewer and fewer people. And the railroads were          pushing further and further into the forest, opening the most remote areas          to development. It became clear that the Forest Preserve law had not saved          the Adirondacks.[49]         In Washington, important moves were being made toward large-scale public          ownership. Congress empowered the President to establish forest preserves          in public lands in 1891, and Benjamin Harrison immediately set aside 13          million acres of public land in the West. Slowly, New York began putting          teeth into the Preserve law. The legislature appropriated $25,000 for          land acquisition in 1890, and Governor Hill directed the Forest Commission          to recommend the boundaries of an Adirondack wilderness park. Two years          later, Gov. Roswell P. Flower signed the Adirondack Park Enabling Act,          placing 2.8 million acres within an imaginary ""blue line,"" of          which 551,000 acres were owned by the state and ""forever reserved          . . . for the free use of all the people.""[50]         In the next legislative session, a law was passed that allowed the state          to sell lumber from its land, and legislators were excited by this long-term          revenue source. In 1894, the state sold timber rights to 17,500 acres          of spruce on public land, netting about $53,000. But loggers on state          land were often sloppy and destructive, and the ""cutting law""          was unpopular with the influential members of private hunting clubs. In          1893, the first commissioner of the USDA Forestry Division, Bernard Fernow,          charged the Forest Commission with incompetence in managing its land.          That summer, smoke from forest fires in the Adirondacks hung in a haze          over the Hudson Valley.         In May 1894, when a convention was called in Albany to revise the state          constitution, the New York Board of Trade and Transportation took action.          They arranged for a delegate, David McClure of New York City, to introduce          an amendment on July 31 that would prohibit logging on state lands. After          holding hearings in August where strong support emerged for the amendment,          McClure moved it on September 8 and the Convention approved it unanimously.          In November, voters ratified the new constitution with a 56 percent majority.         Article VII, Section 7 read, ""The lands of the State, now owned          or hereafter acquired, constituting the Forest Preserve as now fixed by          law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased,          sold, or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private,          nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed, or destroyed.""[51]          The strict final clause prohibited not only logging, but also the removal          of dead timber or the creation of dams that flooded Preserve land. But          it did not say anything about the use of privately-owned lands within          the Blue Line. The state would not tackle that piece of unfinished business          until 1973.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Conclusion         As the nineteenth century ended, most New Yorkers still saw nature as          raw material from which money could be made. The connection between sanitation          and public health was a relatively new idea: it would be more than 30          years before New York City built its first sewage treatment plant. Yet          two influential schools of thought were moving toward an ethic of land          protection. The first was a philosophy that described nature in therapeutic          or moral terms. In the Adirondacks, the Vanderbilts and Whitneys escaped          the stress and grime of cities in their great camps. They were joined          by naturalists like John Burroughs and doctors like Edward Livingston          Trudeau, who often assisted the wealthy in their efforts to protect wild          land by fencing it off.         Other elite hideaways linked nature-worship with other progressive ideas          like feminism, natural health, and free thinking. At Putnam Camp in Keene          Valley, founded by the philosopher William James, eminent guests like          Sigmund Freud were required to chop wood or carry water as well as participate          in salon discussions.[52] On the shores of Seneca Lake in Central New          York, seven prominent women from Geneva and Seneca Falls established a          camp called Fossenvue in 1875 and maintained it until 1901. Women came          to Fossenvue to celebrate nature, but also to wear loose-fitting clothes,          swim, play tennis, and discuss philosophy, all in the company of men.          These were radical notions.[53]          The second view of nature was rooted in the scientific method. Medical          researchers recognized that pure air and water could slow or halt the          spread of infectious diseases, and their successes began the urban sanitation          movement. Scientific foresters did not object to the extraction of resources          from land, but sought to develop methods that would allow logging, mining,          and hunting to continue at sustained levels indefinitely. Within the scientific          umbrella was the emerging field of ecology, which attempted to understand          nature as a system and sought ways to keep the system healthy.          For most of the Twentieth Century, the moral and ecological views of          nature would be overshadowed by the sanitation movement and the sustained          yield philosophy of ""conservation."" And for the next several          decades, the conservation view would be strongly identified with one man:          Gifford Pinchot, another wealthy person with New York connections, who          liked to describe forests as ""factories of wood.""          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         3. 1895 to 1970: The Conservation Era         Gifford Pinchot was groomed to rule the Adirondacks. The son of a wealthy          New York merchant, he made it his life’s work to bring the ideas          of science and business management to public land. As Theodore Roosevelt’s          Secretary of the Interior, and later as governor of Pennsylvania, Pinchot          managed public land as if it were a factory that produced essential goods          like lumber, forage, game animals, and drinking water. Like any business          manager, he was obsessed with efficiency, profit margins, and long-term          yield. But when he tried to apply these ideas to the Adirondacks, New          York would not let him.         Pinchot’s life course was set when he read Marsh’s  Man and          Nature  while a student at Yale, and he continued his education in          the professionally managed forests of Germany and France in 1889-1890.          He returned convinced that Americans could manage their dwindling natural          resources as Europeans did; instead of cutting trees once and then abandoning          the land, they could cut carefully to yield a steady supply of goods.          One of Pinchot’s first jobs in America was writing a forest management          plan for Ne-ha-sa-ne, the Hamilton County estate of William Seward Webb.          In 1897 he published his first book, a small manual called  The Adirondack          Spruce  that became a back-pocket bible for loggers.[54]         The state’s constitutional clause that prohibited logging in the          State Forest Preserve was a major irritation to this Ivy League forester.          Pinchot called the Forever Wild clause a ""sentimental horror""          enacted by people with good intentions but little knowledge. It was, he          said, like ""the case of a farmer who should refuse to cultivate his          farm on the ground that he distrusted his own fitness and integrity.""[55]          Although he supported several attempts to repeal the clause, public sentiment          for the logging ban grew stronger and it survived each attempt. A conclusive          defeat for the pro-logging forces in 1915 settled the issue.         Public forests in the Adirondacks were spared because three powerful          groups wanted them uncut. The first and most important group was wealthy          hunters, anglers, and vacationers from New York, Albany, and Boston. Adirondack          visitors were appalled by the fires and devastation caused by cut-and-run          logging. Since 1917, public lands in the state have been managed with          their needs in mind. White-tailed deer, beaver, and other game animals          have been re-introduced. Boat launching sites have been been maintained          and channels dredged for fishermen; trails have been cut to mountain summits          and pristine lakes. Timber cutting can co-exist with hunting, fishing,          hiking, and trapping, but only if it is done in moderation. Persistent          reports of abuse and corruption in the State Forest Preserve soured relations          between urban sportsmen and rural loggers between 1895 and 1915, leading          to the lockout.          The second group was much less numerous than sportsmen, but they became          more and more influential as the century wore on. Ecologists practiced          a new form of biological science that studied wild land in terms of inputs          and outputs, as if nature was a physics problem or an economic system.          New York produced several men who used early ecological ideas as a springboard          for activism. In the 1920s, C.C. Adams of the New York State Museum advanced          the view that the best way to protect wild mammals was to leave their          habitats undisturbed. In 1917, the activist wing of the Ecological Society          of America formed a Committee for the Preservation of Natural Conditions          and elected Victor Ernest Shelford, a native of Chemung County, as its          chair. The group became independent in 1946 and was re-named The Nature          Conservancy in 1951. The Conservancy’s first land acquisition, in          1955, was in Westchester County.         Scientists and sportsmen began the century united in defense of the wild,          but the relationship grew more strained as the scientific wing turned          to activism. The question of whether or not to support hunting on wildlife          preserves caused a major rift in the National Audubon Society in the 1930s.          The debate continues to this day, with some New York environmental groups          flatly opposed to hunting, others seeking compromise, and the State attempting          to mollify both hunters and wildlife-watchers.          Other early 20 th  Century defenders of natural New York were          middle-class Americans who went into the wild in a new way. Automobile          touring exploded in popularity after the First World War. ""Tin can          tourists,"" so named because they cooked dinner on campfires next          to their cars, moved quickly from a fad to an important source of jobs          and consumer spending. The tourists went to see natural wonders all over          the state, from Ausable Chasm and Whiteface Mountain to Watkins Glen,          the Genesee River Gorge, and Niagara Falls. When they got home, they voted          to protect the land for public use while making it more accessible to          cars.          Before Robert Moses became the great builder of New York City, he lead          a state government initiative to upgrade state parks for the new generation          of recreationists. Automobile touring continued to grow during the Great          Depression because it was a relatively inexpensive way to take a holiday.          The parks themselves were strengthened by an infusion of New Deal laborers.          By 1940, many New Yorkers were driving long distances to spend time in          ""natural"" settings that were, in truth, intensively managed          for swimming, picnicking, camping, and boating.          Many of New York’s environmental stories are about urban and middle-class          people advancing their interests in rural areas. The one urban interest          that has consistently spurred quick action is clean water. In 1905, New          York City needed more drinking water than its Croton reservoirs in Westchester          County could hold. It spent massive sums to create a huge system of reservoirs          and tunnels beginning in the Catskills, and in the process forced hundreds          of residents off of their land. When the tunnels were filled in 1927,          the City had a permanent reason to further restrict growth in the huge          region that gave it pure water.          Another compelling reason for environmental action is a threat to public          health. Concern over foul smells and dead fish in New York Harbor and          Long Island Sound peaked in the 1930s, leading the federal government          to establish an interstate sanitation commission for New York, New Jersey,          and Connecticut. When the first waste treatment plant opened on Coney          Island in 1935, New York State permanently entered the business of controlling          water pollution.          World War II introduced several new factors to environmental affairs          in New York. For example, the first widespread use of a pesticide –          DDT –occurred when the US military needed to control disease-carrying          insects near troops in tropical jungles. The chemical worked miracles,          so it was soon applied in marshes and wetlands across America. In 1948,          a scientist named Dennis Puleston began studying damage to reproductive          systems of birds in eastern Long Island.[56] In 1962, Rachel Carson wrote          about the connection between DDT and bird deaths in  Silent Spring ,          drawing heavily on Puleston’s research.          The war’s environmental legacy included atomic weapons, and with          the Bomb came knowledge that humans could destroy their planet. The legacy          also included nuclear power, and with it came the knowledge that industrial          wastes could contaminate an area for centuries. The war’s legacy          also included the Baby Boom, a huge generation of 77 million Americans          born between 1946 and 1964. The baby boom lead to a boom in suburban housing          in the 1950s, and once-compact urban areas began sprawling into the countryside.          Another war – the cold war – lead Congress to create the National          Defense Highway System. Now known as the Interstate Highway System, these          roads greatly reduced the travel time between a city job, a suburban home,          and a rural campsite.         Gifford Pinchot saw the environment as a factory that produced resources          for public benefit. His idea became the consensus view in the United States          by 1920, but views changed further as the 20 th  century evolved.          In the 1940s and 1950s, business and government leaders began using technology          to push the nature factory harder and harder. Farms were drenched with          fertilizers and pesticides to make more food. Automobiles and industrial          plants produced millions of tons of toxins and released them into the          air and water, trusting nature to absorb them. Park managers cut more          trails into the woods and built more campsites on lakeshores, trusting          nature to clean up after the visitors once they went home.         Early challenges to this worldview came in 1926 and 1930 when two New          Yorkers – Victor Shelford and Bob Marshall – separately released          inventories of the last remaining wild places on the continent, and argued          for their preservation. The challenges reached the courts and legislatures          in 1945, when activists in the Adirondacks began a ten-year grassroots          campaign to stop a dam on the Moose River. In1948, the president of the          New York Zoological Garden voiced a growing skepticism for technology          and growth: ""The grand and ultimate illusion,"" wrote Fairfield          Osborn, ""would be that man could provide a substitute for the elemental          workings of nature.""[57] In the 1950s, researchers found traces of          stronium-90 from atomic tests in baby teeth and mother’s milk. In          the early 1960s, photographs taken from space gave the mass media a powerful          image of earth as a finite, self-contained ecosystem.          Much more than their parents, baby boomers realized the immediacy of          environmental problems. When the oldest members of this generation turned          18, in 1964, they became powerful and blunt advocates for change. Earth          Day was a coming-out party for the new generation of environmental activists.          It also served notice that the older, growth-and-production philosophy          was evolving into a view of nature that emphasized cautious development,          the measurement and control of environmental impact, and setting limits.                 Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Conservation Vs. Preservation         Theodore Roosevelt was born in 1858 and raised among the privileged classes          of New York City and Long Island. As a child, he was taught to venerate          wild nature -- his father was a founder of the American Museum of Natural          History, and the family regularly took camping trips in the Adirondacks          and the West. Roosevelt was a lifelong adherent to the tradition of drawing          spiritual strength from nature: as his biographer writes, ""walking          on silent, moccasin feet down a luminous nave of pines, listening to invisible          choirs of birds, he came close to religious rapture.""[58]         Roosevelt began his political career at age 24 in the New York State          Legislature and gained popularity during a term as the City’s Police          Commissioner. He was elected Governor of New York in 1898 and immediately          called on Gifford Pinchot, a family friend, to be his chief advisor on          conversation issues. But Governor Roosevelt resigned less than two years          after taking office to become Vice-President. When William McKinley was          assassinated in 1901, Roosevelt became the youngest President in US history.          He learned the news while camping in the high peaks of the Adirondacks.                 Setting up his cabinet in a hurry, Roosevelt named Pinchot Secretary          of Agriculture; Pinchot later became head of the newly created US Forest          Service. Promoting conservation on a national scale became the centerpiece          of Roosevelt’s domestic policy agenda, with Pinchot serving as his          chief advisor and closest friend in Washington. The conservation idea          was highly popular with voters, but strongly opposed by Congress and businessmen.          Roosevelt left the Presidency after two terms in 1908 with an unfinished          agenda, but he and Pinchot had succeeded in making scientific land management          the official US government policy. They also tripled the number of acres          under federal control, from about 46 million to more than 150 million.[59]         New York’s conservation agenda proceeded in fits and starts, and          eventually the state chose strict preservation over Pinchot’s conservation.          In 1895, the legislature consolidated different agencies into one Fisheries,          Game, and Forest Commission in an attempt to better enforce hunting and          fishing laws. The Commission’s major role was to supervise a crew          of fish and game ""protectors,"" and one member of its board was          even dubbed the State Oyster Protector. In 1987, a three-member Forest          Preserve Board was created to supervise the Adirondacks and Catskills.          But enforcing game laws was difficult in the early years, especially for          wardens that occasionally had to arrest their neighbors. Deer hunting          season in the early 20 th  century took place in the summer,          for the convenience of wealthy visitors, but was closed in the winter,          when rural residents had the greatest need for food.[60]         Despite the tighter laws, great fires raged in the north woods in 1899.          That same year,  The New York Times  revealed that widespread logging          continued in the Preserve, in clear violation of the law. The fires and          bad publicity were setbacks to those who promoted scientific management,          and they advanced the cause of hands-off forest preservation. Another          setback to the management side came when the new State College of Forestry          at Cornell University, under the direction of Bernard Fernow, made a brief          attempt to demonstrate scientific management principles on 30,000 acres          east of Tupper Lake. Fernow was forced to over-harvest the land to meet          his budget, leaving unsightly fields of stumps. A fire he set to clear          the land got out of control and burned part of a neighbor’s estate.          In 1903, as half a million more acres of Adirondack forest burned, Fernow’s          college was cancelled.          Scientific management became the rule in New York’s privately-owned          forests, but it would never again be tried in the Forest Preserve. In          1914, a coalition of loggers and land owners made another attempt to modify          the state constitution to allow controlled timber cutting in the Preserve.          Louis Marshall, a prominent New York City lawyer and member of the influential          Association for the Preservation of the Adirondacks, argued eloquently          against the proposal. He characterized Fernow’s scientific forestry          experiment as 30,000 acres ""cut down flat from one end to the other.""          He said that a post-logging Preserve would be a ""a howling wilderness          . . . of stumps, enough to make one’s heart sick to behold them.""          While the logging proposal was defeated, voters were sent a new version          of the constitution that would allow fire trails, dead tree removal, and          a new highway through the Preserve. The voters rejected that, too.[61]         Marshall, a native of Syracuse, was not against forestry. In fact, he          lobbied successfully to have a new State College of Forestry established          at Syracuse University. When the college was established in 1911, he served          as the first president of its Board of Directors. Yet Marshall also represented          a faction that wanted some land set aside as wilderness aside from any          economic consideration. The argument that wilderness should exist for          its own sake ran like a philosophical thread from Henry David Thoreau          to John Muir, but Louis Marshall may have been the first to successfully          make the argument before a state legislature. And Marshall’s son,          Bob, took the argument to the people.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         The Wilderness Lobby         Like Theodore Roosevelt, Bob Marshall was raised in a wealthy New York          City family that spent its summers in the Adirondacks. He also shared          Roosevelt’s manic quest for physical activity, and his flair for          dramatic language. Bob Marshall chose a path Roosevelt might have chosen,          had he been born in 1900. His impact might have rivaled Roosevelt’s          if he had reached the age of 40.         Between 1916 and 1925, Bob and his brother George (guided by Herbert          Clark) climbed all 46 Adirondack peaks above 4,000 feet. This feat made          them heroes in the emerging culture of recreational hikers who lived to          tramp through the wild. State officials made the first steps to accommodate          hikers in 1917, when the first trailheads were identified and trails marked          to fire towers on summits. Tellingly, the trails extended to roadside          parking lots. Locals may not have welcomed the automobile traffic, but          they needed it: the logging industry on private land in the Adirondacks          collapsed in the years just before World War I, and tourism provided much-needed          cash in struggling northern towns.         In 1919, the state agency responsible for the Adirondacks reported that          tourism promotion would become a major new emphasis of its work. Instead          of huge tracts of unused lumber, the state now recognized its forests          as ""the most important public vacation grounds in the United States.""[62]          The agency began marking trails and building campsites in the Preserve          to match its new role.         New York wilderness enthusiasts soon got organized. Bob Marshall was          one of their leaders. Another was Meade Dobson, a real estate developer          who was also secretary of the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, which          built and maintained the New York section of the Appalachian Trail in          the 1920s. Another was George Pratt, a former Standard Oil executive who          was on New York’s Conservation Commission. In December 1921, Meade          presided at the first meeting of the Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK), held          at the Abercrombie & Fitch sporting goods store in New York City.          Gifford Pinchot, Louis and Bob Marshall, and Franklin D. Roosevelt were          early club members, along with many prominent lumber executives. The club          was closely allied with other sporting organizations that had emerged          around the state, including the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the Camp          Fire Club, and the Utica Tramp & Trail Club.         In 1928, the ADK announced that it was opposed to cutting timber on the          Forest Preserve, and many members that favored timbering resigned. After          that, the ADK evolved along the same lines as the Sierra Club. It became          an effective watchdog for the Forest Preserve, opposing legislation that          would weaken the Forever Wild clause. It was a recreation group that organized          hikes and trips across the state. And it emphasized education, beginning          with a ""school of the woods"" in the 1930s at its Johns Brook          Lodge. The school was lead by Dr. Orra Phelps, who directed the Club’s          educational efforts for many years.[63]          Bob Marshall went on to earn a Ph.D in plant physiology and a career          in the US Forest Service. In 1930, in an article called ""The Problem          of the Wilderness,"" he re-stated the pro-wilderness argument in the          voice of his generation: ""There is just one hope of repulsing the          tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole          earth. That hope is the organization of spirited people who will fight          for the freedom of the wilderness.""[64]         In 1934, Bob Marshall suggested that the Secretary of the Interior name          a ""Wilderness Planning Board"" to choose areas that ought to          be set aside by Congress. In 1935, he organized The Wilderness Society          to lobby for the idea. In 1939, he died of a heart attack. Twenty-five          years later, Congress passed the Wilderness Act and accepted many of the          recommendations Marshall had made in the 1930s. In 2000, the Wilderness          Society had 200,000 members and was active around the world.[65]          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Showdown At Moose River         By the time Marshall died, a militant group of wilderness defenders was          watching out for the Adirondacks. Many leaders of the wilderness lobby          lived in Schenectady. The most respected member was John Apperson, a General          Electric engineer and lifelong bachelor who once said, ""Lake George          is my wife and its islands are my children.""[66] In 1932, these forces          defeated a proposal that would have allowed highways and state-owned lodges          to be built in the Preserve. In 1939, the ADK’s Conservation Committee          stated positions on 152 bills before the state legislature. In 1950, the          lobby fought off a proposal to allow salvage logging in the Preserve after          a major storm leveled thousands of acres.         The wilderness lobby’s greatest victory was also the first example          of a now-familiar story. In the eleventh hour, environmental advocates          learned of a damaging proposal and fought a public relations crusade to          stop it. The story began in 1919, when the Black River Regulating District          was formed to build hydroelectric power for the industrial development          of Watertown. Dams along the Black, Moose, and Beaver Rivers were planned,          including two that would flood large areas of the Forest Preserve at Panther          Mountain and Higley Mountain. After decades on the drawing board, the          State Conservation Department approved the Higley dam in 1945. The Panther          dam was next in line.          Paul Schaefer and Edmund Richard, two proteges of Apperson’s, began          organizing opposition to the dams in October 1945. Many conservation leaders          initially refused to help them, believing that it was a lost cause. But          Schaefer wrote eloquently about the lands that would be destroyed by the          dam, attended meetings all over the state, and built the opposition steadily.          In March 1947, Governor Dewey put the dams on hold and directed a state          agency to study the problem. Several months later, the Governor arranged          to kill the Higley proposal, but announced his support for the much larger          reservoir at Panther Mountain – with Richard’s support. Schaefer          fought to bring Richard back into the anti-dam fold, and persuaded him          to become President of the Adirondack Moose River Committee. Eventually          the Committee persuaded nearly 1,000 clubs and organizations to oppose          the Panther dam, along with most of the East’s major newspapers.          When the state Supreme Court rejected their case against Panther, Schaefer          persuaded legislators to hold public hearings around the state and packed          the hearings with anti-dam forces.          In 1950, Governor Dewey bowed to intense public pressure and signed a          law that prohibited Panther Dam. The Black River District fought the law          to the US Supreme Court, where it finally lost. In 1953, an amendment          was added to the state constitution prohibiting future dams in the Forest          Preserve, and was ratified by voters with a 59 percent majority. In 1955,          a constitutional amendment proposed by the Black River District that would          have specifically allowed the dam was defeated by a margin of 72 percent,          and the issue was settled. In 1945, there were plans for 38 reservoirs          in the Adirondacks. In 1955, thanks to an extraordinary mobilization of          citizen opposition, all the plans were scrapped, and none had been built.[67]         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Audubon’s Pioneer Activists         In the Nineteenth Century, the scientific study of life on earth was          mostly an avocation for the wealthy. John James Audubon retired to his          country home in upper Manhattan in the 1840s, after a life of producing          bird portraits that married science and art. Theodore Roosevelt’s          original career goal was to become a naturalist, and his first publication          was a guide to the birds of Franklin County. In the Twentieth Century,          however, the life sciences emerged and matured in the nation’s universities.          The professional scientists and philosophers who were concerned with plants,          mammals, birds, insects, and ecosystems became heroes and leaders for          the enthusiastic amateurs who were sworn to protect nature. At the turn          of the century, this alliance produced the Audubon Society. In mid-century,          it produced the Nature Conservancy. Both groups were born and raised in          New York.         In the 1880s, some members of the American Ornithological Union (AOU)          became increasingly concerned about the wholesale slaughter of wild birds          for commercial use. Egrets and other wading birds were being massacred          for their plumage. Commercial expeditions killed hundreds of ducks and          other migrating birds for restaurant use or even just for sport, leaving          their bodies to rot. Species such as the passenger pigeon were wiped out,          while others like the Eskimo curlew were facing extinction. No laws existed          to stop the shooting. In 1886, George Bird Grinnell, a big-game hunter,          Manhattan resident, and editor of the magazine  Forest and Stream ,          was motivated to act. He established the Audubon Society for the protection          of wild birds, and in three months 38,000 people had joined. Most of the          first members were activists associated with scientists at the AOU or          the American Museum of Natural History.          Grinnell could not afford to support the new group and he disbanded it          in 1888. But it began again in Boston in 1896, at the urging of a wealthy          matron named Harriet Hemenway. A New York Chapter was formed in 1897,          along with independent chapters in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and other          states, and the activist coalition worked to pass a ""model law,""          drafted by the AOU, banning the use of plumes in women’s hats. Not          all members of the AOU endorsed the group’s actions, however. The          more conservative scientists found the Audubon leaders brash and confrontational.          Some Audubons were even opposed to any killing of animals, and in 1900          the study of animals usually involved killing them.         Because the hat-making and garment industries were based in New York          City, much of the plumage trade came in and out of that port, and Audubon’s          early activities were centered there. In 1904, a wealthy New York insurance          executive named Albert Willcox contacted William Dutcher, chair of the          AOU’s Bird Protection Committee. Willcox offered to pay for a staff          and an office, and to leave at least $100,000 in his will, if Audubon          would incorporate and expand its activities to the protection of wild          animals. In 1905, the existing 35 state clubs incorporated as the National          Association of Audubon Societies for the Protection of Wild Birds and          Animals, with headquarters in Manhattan. Dutcher was named the first Audubon          President. By 1913, the society had a staff of six in a building at 66 th           street and Broadway.          Under the direction of President Gilbert Pearson, the Audubon Society          pioneered three central activities of the modern environmental protection          movement. [68] First, Audubon hired private game wardens to keep hunters          away from important wildlife habitat. Their first wardens were hired in          1900 to protect Arctic terns and other seabirds along the Maine Coast.          The idea quickly gained Theodore Roosevelt’s attention, and in March          1903 he set aside the first federal wildlife refuge (on Florida’s          Indian River). Later, Audubon itself began owning preserves. Its second          preserve, established in 1924, was 12 acres of songbird habitat adjacent          to Theodore Roosevelt’s family mansion in Oyster Bay, Long Island.                 In the 1920s, the science of wildlife management was still evolving and          preserve wardens were often left to follow their instincts. Eugene Swope,          the first warden of the Roosevelt Sanctuary, patrolled the grounds with          a .22 rifle and tended to kill anything that was not a songbird. Cowbirds,          blue jays, and crows were tolerated in small numbers, but starlings, owls,          and hawks were shot on sight. Swope was proud of the fact that during          his 14 years at the preserve, he killed 147 cats and 360 snakes. The phrase          ""balance of nature"" was unknown to him, as it was to many managers          of his era. Swope planted fruit trees, berry bushes, and other food crops          for birds, with no regard to whether the plant was native to the area.          After he left in 1938, volunteers worked for decades to restore the area          to a semblance of what it had once been before he arrived.[69]          Audubon’s second trail-blazing activity was establishing a permanent          environmental lobby. New York State’s Audubon Plumage law passed          in 1910, and the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act passed in 1918. The          anti-plumage campaign established Audubon as a full-time supporter and          watchdog for federal environmental agencies such as the Fish and Wildlife          Service, the Soil Conversation Service, and the Forest Service. The public          and private wildlife refuge systems grew in tandem, their relationship          shifting from admiration to antagonism depending on the issue at hand.                 The third pioneering Audubon activity was environmental education. In          1899, the magazine  Bird-Lore  began under the editorial direction          of Frank Chapman, an ornithologist with the American Museum of Natural          History. The Audubon Society worked closely with the magazine, which became          the unofficial journal of the birding movement. The Society bought the          magazine in 1935 and re-named it  Audubon  in 1940. In 1910, the          Junior Audubon Clubs began when the Society provided free classroom materials          and field trips to public schools. Arthur Allen, a professor of ornithology          at Cornell, created many of the early educational materials. By 1934,          more than four million children across the country had passed through          the club’s ranks.         One of Audubon’s most powerful allies came to the Society through          the nine-member Bronx County Bird Club. Roger Tory Peterson was a small-town          boy who got his passion for birds from the Junior Audubon Club of Jamestown,          in Chatauqua County. As a young man, he virtually created the modern role          of the birder. He and his cronies in the Bronx Club wielded binoculars          instead of guns, chased bird sightings anywhere they could go (the Hunt’s          Point Dump was a favorite site), and passionately pursued their ""life          list"" of species sighted. Peterson, a gifted artist, joined the Audubon          Society in November 1934, six months after the first edition of his book,           A Field Guide to the Birds,  was published. The book has sold millions          of copies and is still in print. During his seven years at Audubon, Peterson          also re-designed and updated the Junior Club materials. Between 1934 and          1941, another five million children passed through the Club.         The Audubon Society was also one of the first organizations to recognize          the value of color photographs in promoting environmental causes.  Audubon           magazine moved early to publish beautiful bird pictures in its pages,          and the images symbolized wild nature to thousands of urban readers who          rarely saw the real thing. In the 1930s and 1940s, Cornell ornithologist          Olin Pettingill, along with Roger Peterson and others, toured the country          with movie projectors to host the Audubon Screen Tours. The movies they          showed to local bird clubs and civic organizations were among the first          ""wildlife films"" ever made. The screen tours crew shot as well          as hosted the movies; their lectures built the movement, but also established          a new kind documentary filmmaking and proved its popularity.         The Audubon Society faced constant internal tension over how far it should          push its agenda. The more cautious members, such as President Gilbert          Pearson, argued that compromise with hunters and developers was sometimes          necessary to stay at the bargaining table. More radical members, such          as Rosalie Edge, fought bitterly against this view. In 1929, Edge headed          up a faction that eventually pushed Pearson out. The Pearson-Edge battle          continues throughout the environmental movement to this day, with different          actors voicing the same opinions.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         From Theory to Practice         The 1920 U.S. Census showed that for the first time, more Americans lived          in urban areas than in small towns or farms. As it became the new norm,          urban life encouraged new kinds of thinking about the environment. Scientists          and philosophers began to consider the ethical and environmental aspects          of large urban areas, an industrial economy, and growing consumer spending.          When the century began, only a few voices questioned the need to cut trees          for newspaper, strip hillsides for coal, and foul harbors with sewage.          By mid-century, these voices had become a loud chorus, and in the 1960s          they coalesced into a political movement.          An early proponent of everyday environmentalism was Albert Schweitzer,          a physician and missionary who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian          work in Africa. Schweitzer’s ethnical system was organized around          the German word Ehrfurcht, which connotes awed humility in the face of          a vast and mysterious power. Right conduct for a human being, he wrote          in 1915, means showing equal reverence for all forms of life, and giving          ""to every will-to-live the same reverence for life that he gives          his own.""[70] When Schweitzer encountered a worm washed onto the          pavement by a rainstorm, he would carefully place it back in the grass.          He would not eat meat or kill any living thing unless it was absolutely          necessary, and then only with compassion for the life that had to be sacrificed.          He saw humans as a component of a great web, and argued that each part          of the web of life demanded equal respect.          Schweitzer was also one of the first writers to place environmental ethics          within Christian doctrine. His writings inspired Christians in the US          as they joined battles against nuclear weapons and pollution in the 1940s          and 1950s. In the 1960s, Christians in the ""eco-justice"" movement          were the intellectual grandchildren of writers like Schweitzer and John          Burroughs. They argued that wild nature had a right to exist that was          independent of man’s interests, and that pollution was both unjust          and disrespectful of God’s creation.          Natural scientists also advanced these views, although their motivation          may have been professional. Some of the leading scientist-activists came          from New York. One was C.C. Adams, an ecologist from the New York State          Museum who spoke out for the rights of predators.         The federal Bureau of Biological Survey (BBS) had adopted a policy of          exterminating predators early in the century. Professional hunters from          the BBS spread across the West, setting thousands of poison traps for          coyotes and shooting wolves, cougars, and eagles on sight, to reduce the          loss of livestock. This was in keeping with the Gifford Pinchot ideal          of maximum production from public land, and it also matched Pinchot’s          conservationist disregard for aesthetics and other non-economic concerns.          The policy was challenged in 1923 by the American Society of Mammologists,          and for the next 25 years the Society waged a running battle with the          government to spare the predators. C.C. Adams, a prominent animal ecologist,          led the effort.          ""We are probably the richest nation on earth,"" Adams wrote          in 1924. ""What would be the cost of maintaining one hundred mountain          lions in North America? Would it stagger American civilization? We have          millions of acres in National Forests, in the Public Domain, and in National          Parks. Some of these could be managed in such a fashion that some of the          animals could be preserved and eat deer meat!""[71] The killing of          predators in National Parks was halted in 1936, although extermination          efforts on some federal lands continued into the 1970s.         The steady intrusion of human influence into natural areas was a major          challenge to ecologists, whose research was often ruined by pollution          or development. The Ecological Society of America, founded in 1911, split          over this problem. Some early members were not willing to involve a scientific          organization in political fights over land. Others were willing, and the          leader of the activist wing was a former farm boy from Chemung County.                 In 1917, Victor Shelford became chair of the ESA’s Committee for          the Preservation of Natural Conditions. In 1926, the committee published           The Naturalist’s Guide to the Americas,  an attempt to catalog          all the known patches of wilderness left in the New World. In 1946, after          the ESA dissolved the committee, Shelford founded the Ecologists Union,          whose 158 charter members vowed to take ""direct action"" to save          threatened areas. In 1951, the group incorporated and re-named itself          The Nature Conservancy. Shelford remained active in the group until his          death in 1968.[72]         Other New Yorkers pioneered techniques the Conservancy has used to protect          millions of acres. In the early 1940s, a University of Rochester ecologist          named Dick Goodwin and friends became concerned about Bergen Swamp, a          threatened wetland about 20 miles east of town. Goodwin had no funds to          survey the property, so he did it himself. Then he talked to the landowners          until he persuaded a farmer to sell the first five acres for $125. Bergen          Swamp is now a 2,000-acre preserve. Goodwin became President of the Nature          Conservancy in 1956. In 2000, the group honored him as ""father of          the land deal.""[73]         The Conservancy’s first land deal happened in New York. In 1955,          members and friends purchased 60 acres of the Mianus River Gorge in Westchester          County with a $7,500 loan from the group. This was the first use of the          Conservancy’s revolving Land Preservation Fund, which proved crucial          to the organization's success. New York foundations were also instrumental          in the early years. In 1966, the Ford Foundation made it possible for          the Conservancy to hire its first full-time President. In 1968, Ford guaranteed          a $6 million line of credit to the Land Fund, which allowed the Conservancy          to purchase and hold land for later sale to the US Government – an          important technique that came to be known as the ""government co-op.""[74]                 As ecologists looked for new ways to preserve the environment, universities          themselves also began playing a direct role in environmental affairs.          In 1914, the federal Smith-Lever Act created the Cooperative Extension          system. University-sponsored agents were soon spreading across the country          to share the findings of agricultural research with farmers. In New York,          Cornell Cooperative Extension agents taught farmers how to control erosion,          protect drinking water supplies, and improve sanitation. The father of          the national system was Cornell professor Liberty Hyde Bailey, who lead          the ""Country Life Movement"" to improve rural living conditions.[75]         Bailey was a prominent horticulturalist whose influence went far beyond          his field. Another part of the Country Life Movement encouraged farm children          to study the natural world around them, just as John Burroughs and Victor          Shelford had done. Bailey brought John W. Spencer, a Chautauqua County          fruit-grower and writer, to Cornell to organize Junior Naturalist Clubs.          Pamphlets with titles like ""How a Squash Plant Gets Out of Its Seed""          and ""A Children’s Garden"" were soon being mailed from Cornell          to schools all over the country. Ever since, Ithaca has been a national          center for the nature education movement.[76]         In 1914, Bailey wrote a small book called  The Holy Earth  that          placed him squarely in the ""biocentric"" tradition. Bailey argued          against abusing God’s creation and for a sense of ""earth righteousness""          in society, so that people would ""put our dominion in the realm of          morals. It is now in the realm of trade."" The long-term success of          this book persuaded millions of readers of the moral rights of nature.          Forester Aldo Leopold acknowledged Bailey’s influence on his enormously          influential moral argument for nature,  A Sand County Almanac , which          was released in 1948.  The Holy Earth  was also re-released in an          inexpensive paperback edition in 1943 by the Christian Rural Fellowship,          and was distributed worldwide.[77]         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Robert Moses and Franklin Roosevelt         Before 1925, public land in New York meant the Adirondacks and the Catskills.          The state owned 19 small parks outside the Forest Preserve, and one 1,000-acre          tract in the gorge of the Genesee River. The parks offered few public          services, all of them were west of the Hudson River, and most had been          donated. Buffalo financier William Letchworth had purchased and donated          the Genesee property, for example. The Treman family of Ithaca bankers          purchased and donated Enfield Glen.          Independent boards ran the parks on small budgets, without support from          the state, but parks had few needs before the age of automobile tourism.          Most of them were really undeveloped preserves, such as the open land          around the American side of Niagara Falls, or historic sites, like the          Revolutionary War battlefield near Saratoga. It couldn’t be more          different today: in 2000, the New York State Park system served 65 million          visitors to 152 parks and more than 100 historic sites, beaches, swimming          pools, golf courses, and nature centers.          The changes began in 1923, when Robert Moses wrote and released a comprehensive          plan for state park development. They were set in motion in 1924, when          Robert Moses led a successful campaign to pass a $15 million bond act.          Then a strong State Parks Commissioner – Robert Moses – shoved          the philanthropists aside and built the system he had imagined.         Robert Moses probably did more than any other single person to change          the landscape of New York. Between 1924 and 1968, he headed dozens of          appointed commissions and authorities that built dams, bridges, highways,          and parks. He changed the courses of the St. Lawrence and Niagara Rivers.          He filled in thousands of acres of marshland around New York City and          filled the new lands with houses and roads. He created 27,000 acres of          parks in New York City and Long Island alone, starting with Jones Beach,          the largest public beach in the world, in 1926.          Governor Al Smith appointed Moses the executive director of the State          Council of Parks in January 1927, giving him broad authority over the          once- independent park organizations.[78] Moses’ state park building          program proved enormously popular with voters because Moses understood          the aspirations of the new middle class. He built parkways from New York          and other urban centers to Jones Beach and other playgrounds, and he took          pains to see that they were pleasant places for a weekend drive. The parks          offered amusements that went far beyond hiking or sightseeing. Jones Beach          had an amphitheater for concerts, and many rebuilt state parks included          swimming places, tennis courts, golf courses, and cabins.          Robert Moses was secure enough and successful enough that in 1928, newly          elected governor Franklin D. Roosevelt quickly re-appointed him. When          the Great Depression engulfed the state, inexpensive state park vacations          became more popular than ever. Moses kept his position as State Parks          Commissioner, but he also directed programs in New York City that used          unemployed men to build more parks and playgrounds.         Franklin Roosevelt was born in 1882 and raised on an estate in Hyde Park          overlooking the Hudson River. Like his distant cousin Theodore, Franklin          was an outdoor explorer with signifiacnt physical weaknesses and a strong          spiritual attachment to nature; even as President, he spent time designing          and ordering new plantings at Hyde Park.[79]          Park-building was popular with the wealthy, who favored preservation;          with the middle class, who sought outdoor recreation; and with the poor,          who needed affordable ways to escape form the city. This lesson was not          lost on Roosevelt when he was elected President. One of the earliest and          most popular New Deal programs was the Civilian Conservation Corps, which          hired 3 million young men to complete roads, trails, and buildings in          parks all over the country. In Ithaca, unemployed masons built artful          stone walkways through Enfield Glen and Watkins Glen, making them at once          easier to visit and more beautiful. By the time the Depression ended,          a vast system of public recreational facilities had become an institution          in New York and many other states.         The Depression also caused thousands of acres of privately owned land          in New York to revert to state and federal government. Agriculture in          New York had been in a slow decline since 1890, as exhausted soils and          better transportation favored farming in the Midwest and South. The number          of acres in farms peaked in 1900 at 22.6 million and then declined steadily.          Farming in New York collapsed between 1920 and 1930, with the number of          cultivated acres declining 13 percent. As the agricultural crisis deepened          in the 1930s, Roosevelt moved quickly to provide relief. Federal laws          established a Resettlement Administration that would buy marginal farmland          and move its former owners to better land or other jobs. Between 1938          and 1941, about 16,000 acres of failing farmland was purchased along the          high rocky ridge that separates Cayuga and Seneca Lakes. In 1985 this          land was re-named the Finger Lakes National Forest, and it is the only          unit of the US Forest Service in the state.[80]         Other Federal Laws in 1929 and 1934 enabled Washington to buy migratory          bird habitat and regulate hunting on those lands. The expansion of the          National Wildlife Refuge system was also a conservation measure, as wetlands          not suitable for farming were being filled and plowed by desperate farmers.          The government acquired almost 7,900 acres at the north end of Cayuga          Lake to create the Montezuma refuge, and more than 10,800 acres of muckland          near Batavia became the Iroquois refuge. In 2000, the Fish and Wildlife          Service manages 13 refuges in New York that cover more than 28,000 acres.[81]                 New York State began acquiring land outside of the Adirondack and Catskill          Preserves in the early 1900s, taking up more of the slack left by the          long-term contraction of New York agricultural land. The number of acres          in cultivation in New York in 1970 was 10.1 million, less than half the          acreage of 1900. In 1990, the acreage total had declined even further,          to 8.4 million.[82] Agriculture remains important to the state’s          economy because the land remaining in cultivation is highly fertile. But          millions of acres of former farms have reverted to forests, and nearly          700,000 of those acres were purchased and converted to forest by the state.          State Forests, like National Forests, are managed as ""multiple use""          facilities; unlike the Preserves, they allow logging and grazing with          hunting and hiking.[83]          Since the middle of the century, New York’s public lands have been          managed according to three different philosophies. Gifford Pinchot’s          conservation ideal of maximum sustained production is the rule in the          state forests. The recreational vision of Robert Moses still governs the          state park system. And in the Adirondacks and Catskills, great public          reserves of untouchable open land reflect the Roosevelt cousins’          patrician love of the wild.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Pollution Control: Water, Air, and Land         In 1950, New York had 14.8 million residents, and more than eight in          ten lived in urban areas. The volume of wastes produced by cities was          becoming impossible to ignore. Safe supplies of drinking water and fish          were increasingly threatened by inadequate ways of disposing of sewage          and garbage. Automobile exhaust was making the air unsafe to breathe,          especially in summer months. In the nineteenth century, waste and filth          were accepted by New York City residents as facts of life. In the 1950s          and 1960s, new standards of science and sanitation made them intolerable          – and outside of major cities, media images of rat-infested garbage          and smoke-darkened skies fueled a sense of crisis.         New York State government had been in the business of regulating municipal          drinking water since 1904, when the state Water Supply Commission was          created. All cities except New York were required to submit their plans          for new water supplies to the Commission, and the Commission began reporting          on water sources, water quality, and methods of sewage disposal. When          the State Department of Health was created in 1901, one of its duties          was to investigate diseases caused by ""overflow of the canals.""          But the first serious effort to control water pollution did not begin          until 1935, when a federal Interstate Sanitation Commission was established          to regulate sewage in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.         Basic sanitation laws had a dramatic impact on health in America. Expectancy          of life at birth increased from 47 in 1900 to 54 in 1920, 63 in 1940,          and 70 in 1960, mostly because of sharp declines in viral and bacterial          diseases.[84] Sewage treatment was a major contributor to these declines.          By 1960, 80 percent of New York City’s sewage during dry weather          was cleaned before it was discharged. But a lot of filth was not being          treated. Sanitary engineeers in 1895 had combined the city’s storm          sewers with its waste sewers. Each heavy rain overwhelmed the system and          dumped millions of gallons of raw waste into the Hudson and the harbor.          In 1965, voters passed the Pure Waters Bond Act and released $300 million          for sewage treatment statewide.         Air pollution was largely unregulated in New York until 1957, when state          law created an Air Pollution Control Board and empowered it ""to enter          and inspect any property or motor vehicle for the purpose of identifying          pollutants.""[85] The Board may have had the power, but its small          staff could only enforce the law against the most egregious polluters.          Air pollution was added to the jurisdiction of the federal Interstate          Sanitation Commission in 1962, and the first federal Clean Air Act was          passed in 1963. But the number one source of air pollution – the          private automobile – was not regulated until 1970, when amendments          to the Clean Air Act forced automobile manufacturers to install pollution          control devices.         Garbage disposal laws also lagged behind the need. Before the federal          Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 was passed, state and local health departments          regulated landfills, and they had widely varying standards. Some cities          burned their garbage in open pits; others buried it in unlined trenches          that allowed toxic liquids to ooze into the water table.          President Lyndon Johnson formed a Commission on Natural Beauty in 1965.          The state followed with its own Natural Beauty Commission in 1966. Both          were attempts to address the sense that America’s land, water, and          air were fouled by the wastes of manufacturing and consumer culture. But          like the early anti-pollution laws, these efforts had little or no effect          on the public’s mood. Books, films, and television reflected the          concern with increasingly shrill warnings. In a memorable 1971 television          commercial, the actor Iron Eyes Cody, clad in buckskin and wearing a feather          headdress, shed a single tear as he gazed upon a mountain of garbage.[86]                 By the end of the 1960s, the Conservation Era had run its course. It          was no longer enough to manage nature for human needs. Nature had become          the environment, and most Americans agreed that the environment was in          grave danger because of human activity. Instead of serving a modern society,          nature now had to be protected from it. --         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents                 4. 1970 to 2000: The Environmental Machine         Earth Day came early to Port Washington, Long Island. On April 22, 1969,          a small group of students from Paul Schreiber High School put on rubber          boots, picked up garbage bags, and waded into a dirty creek that ran through          the village. Picking through the muck, they cleaned out several hundred          pounds of beer cans, food wrappers, and old tires. ""We were eager          to get the lead out of gasoline, expunge all pollutants, and leave the          world a better place than we found it,"" says Robin Weston, a member          of the school’s 1969 Earth Day Committee. In small ways, they did.         Looking beyond their neighborhoods, New Yorkers saw a United States that          seemed to be coming apart. The invasion of Cambodia by American troops          sparked violent protests across the country in the spring of 1970. At          Kent State University, one demonstration horrified the nation when National          Guard soldiers fired into the crowd, killing four students. After the          shootings, some anti-war activists began calling for a violent revolution.          And then, on April 22 of that year -- a crisp, sunny day that also happened          to be Lenin’s birthday – 20 million Americans gathered peacefully          across the country. People picked up litter, planted trees, danced to          rock bands, and held street theater. The purpose of this huge, happy party          was to show public support for a cleaner environment.         Earth Day started small in Port Washington and a few other places, but          the time was right for it. Just one year later, it became the largest          planned demonstration in US history. The size of the 1970 turnout shocked          even the organizers. Politicians noted that Earth Day participants seemed          willing to work within the system instead of tearing it down. In White          Plains, junior high school students painted and cleaned up the local railroad          station. In New York City, crowded Fifth Avenue sidewalks parted when          demonstrators held up dead fish from the contaminated Hudson River and          shouted, ""You’re next, people!""[87] In one extraordinary          day, the environmental movement entered the mainstream.          Some observers were troubled by the change. ""Just as the Caesars          once used bread and circuses, so ours were at last learning to use rock-and-roll,          idealism and non-inflammatory social issues to turn the youth off from          more urgent concerns which might really threaten the power structure,""          wrote journalist I.F. Stone. If the war was not ended and nuclear weapons          controlled, said Stone, ""we may wake up one morning and find there          is nothing left on Earth to pollute.""[88]          But something really had happened. Earth Day embodied the fear that human          activities were destroying the planet, and it showed that millions of          Americans were determined to clean up the mess. It also uncorked a steady          stream of major environmental legislation that did not slow down for ten          years. The most astute politicians were first on the bandwagon. On January          1, 1970, President Nixon signed the landmark National Environmental Policy          Act, which required the federal government to analyze the environmental          impact of its activities. On Earth Day 1970, New York Governor Nelson          Rockefeller signed the law that created a new ""super-agency,""          the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). By the end of the          year, the US Environmental Protection Agency was on the books. During          the 1970s, court decisions and federal laws placed hundreds of new requirements          on state and local governments. By 1980, environmental affairs had become          a major focus of government at the local, state, and national level.

Source: Shabecoff, Philip,  A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental            Movement                 The new laws and regulations did get results. Many measures of water          quality stabilized or improved during the 1970s, for example, and control          of pesticides such as DDT had a positive effect on wildlife. But the new          rules also frustrated farmers, business people, and others whose normal          activities had suddenly become illegal. In 1980, the anti-environmental          movement helped elect a President who said that the new laws had gone          too far. But when Ronald Reagan tried to dismantle the environmental bureaucracy,          the effort backfired. Massive public opposition caused most of his proposals          to fail, and environmental organizations saw their biggest membership          increases ever. Environmental affairs went through a federal trial in          the 1980s, and they emerged stronger than before.         The backlash never really took root in the Empire State. Despite revenue          shortages and intense budget fights in the 1980s, grassroots support for          environmental causes in New York was consistently too strong for politicians          to ignore. Responding to the pressure, Democratic governors Hugh Carey          and Mario Cuomo preserved and expanded the DEC and its regulatory structure          during the 1970s and 1980s. Among the state’s major advances were          the first regulations on private land in the Adirondacks, in 1973; a state          Superfund to clean up toxic waste sites, in 1982; and the first of several          bond acts in 1986. In 1994, Republican George Pataki was elected after          promising continued leadership on clean air, clean water, and open space.          In 1996, he campaigned successfully for another bond act devoted to these          causes.         As the state strengthened its commitments, environmentalism began mingling          with other issues. During the 1990s, the number of land trusts operating          in New York increased from a handful to more than 80, and hundreds of          privately-owned nature preserves and conservation easements were established.          City planners and transportation experts often turned to these groups          when looking for ways to manage ""urban sprawl"" without resorting          to government action. From skyscrapers in Manhattan to dairy farms in          Delaware County, executives found that ""green business"" practices          could deliver dramatic reductions in waste and energy use while increasing          profits. African-American and Latino neighborhoods became centers for          the ""environmental justice"" movement, which challenged plans          to locate toxic waste dumps and other high-impact sites near low-income          neighborhoods.          In the 1990s, the vast majority of New Yorkers said they were ""environmentalists""[89],          and New York’s delegation to the US Congress received consistently          high rankings from the League of Conservation Voters. Yet environmental          issues continued to be difficult and contentious. Beginning in the 1970s,          opposition to environmental objectives became ""persistent, profound,          and effective,"" according to historian Samuel P. Hays.[90] Businesses          moved aggressively to control the terms of the environmental debate by          controlling information about environmental problems. The pattern was          clear: as soon as a new law was passed, pro- and anti-environmental forces          shifted their focus to regulatory agencies and courts, where they fought          through the same controversies at least once more. In this arena, decisions          were often based on the conflicting testimonies of scientists hired by          the opposing sides.          Although environmental causes were consistently popular, government efforts          to improve environmental quality were not usually met with public acclaim.          More often, the changes were slow in coming and difficult to achieve.                 Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Courts, Citizens, and Cash          The environmental laws of the 1970s were pushed into existence by determined          groups of citizens. Some were lawyers who seized new opportunities to          sue on behalf of nature. Others harnessed the public’s concern and          created powerful lobbies in Washington and the state capitols, beginning          with Albany. Others worked behind the scenes to secure large donations          from foundations and the wealthy, getting the money that made the machine          run. And for all three groups -- the lawyers, the activists, and the fund-raisers          -- the center of the action was in New York City.         The lawyers got their first break on December 29, 1965, when the Second          Circuit Court Of Appeals ruled that a group of citizens calling themselves          the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference had the legal standing to sue          an electric utility to stop its building plans at Storm King Mountain.          The Court also ruled that the Federal Power Commission had to consider          the project’s impact on the ""unique beauty and historic significance""          of the area before it could grant Con Edison a building permit.[91] The          field of environmental law was born on that day, and it grew up fast.          In 1970, environmental statutes filled fewer than 30 pages of the  Environmental          Law Reporter.  By 1989, they filled more than 800 pages.[92] Many of          the statutes were written to answer questions raised by court decisions.         Two New York groups led the legal efforts that widened the reach of environmental          law. After leading Scenic Hudson’s legal campaign, David Sive and          several colleagues went on to start the National Resources Defense Council          (NRDC), which still maintains its headquarters in New York City. In 1971,          the NRDC led the campaign for passage of the Clean Water Act, which allows          citizens to sue directly for environmental harm. In 1973, the group began          actions that lead to the phase-out of lead in gasoline. In 1978, it succeeded          in removing ozone-depleting chemicals from aerosol cans. In 2000, the          group has over 400,000 members and is active around the world.[93]         In 1966, a Patchogue lawyer named Victor Yaccone sued the Suffolk County          Mosquito Control Commission to prevent it from further use of DDT. The          plaintiff in the suit was Yaccone’s wife, Carol, and the energy behind          it came from the Brookhaven Town Natural Resources Committee. The suit          drew on research that showed the destructive effects of DDT on fish and          birds in the area -- the same research cited by Rachel Carson in her book           Silent Spring . After winning a local injunction, the group re-organized          in 1967 as the Environmental Defense Fund and pushed for a permanent ban.                 Early support from the National Audubon Society and the Ford Foundation          allowed the Environmental Defense Fund to expand its focus beyond DDT,          and also beyond New York’s borders. In 1970, it brought whales onto          the US Endangered Species List. In 1972, it won a permanent nationwide          ban on DDT. In 1978, it helped save a 114-mile stretch of the Delaware          River from a dam planned for Tocks Island. In 1992, its computer models          helped convince New York State legislators that energy from a huge hydroelectric          project in James Bay, Quebec might not be needed; New York canceled its          contract for the power, killing the project. In 1997, Environmental Defense          celebrated its 30th anniversary as an international organization devoted          as much to education as to litigation, with more than 300,000 dues-paying          members.[94]         Non-profit environmental organizations in New York gained members steadily          through the 1970s. In 1976, they also gained clout in Washington when          Elvis Stahr, President of the Manhattan-based National Audubon Society,          persuaded Barber Conable, a Congressman from upstate New York, to lead          an effort to reform the tax laws. The ""Conable Act"" allowed          smaller non-profit organizations to spend up to 20 percent of their budgets          on lobbying activities without endangering their tax-exempt status. Larger          organization could spend up to $1 million a year. The Act created a new          and powerful force -- the environmental lobby.[95]         The Conable Act became necessary in 1966, when the IRS revoked the Sierra          Club’s tax exemption for excessive lobbying. The Club survived that          blow, grew steadily, and developed a reputation for organizing dramatic          grassroots campaigns. In the 1980s, Club members in New York State organized          as the Atlantic Chapter. In 2000 that chapter had 32,500 members, including          nearly 12,000 in New York City. Unfortunately, the Club’s reputation          for waging epic battles also extended to its internal politics. In the          late 1990s, a dispute between members of the New York City group escalated          into lawsuits that cost the national organization hundreds of thousands          of dollars.[96]         The National Audubon Society is an international organization with 550,000          members, 500 chapters, and more than 250,000 acres of wildlife sanctuaries,          but its roots are in the better neighborhoods of Manhattan (see chapter          3). In 2000, Audubon had 30 formally organized chapters and almost 42,000          members in the Empire State. It also had informal ties to at least 29          more bird clubs in New York, and its nature education programs served          dozens of nature education centers around the state.[97]         The Nature Conservancy is another international group with New York roots          (see chapter 4). It protects millions of acres of land around the world          through the ownership of nature preserves and conservation easements,          including more than 277,000 acres in New York State. The Conservancy has          900,000 members, making it the world’s largest private conservation          group. Eight percent of its membership (70,000 people) lives in New York          State. Independent from the group, but using the same tools, are smaller          private organizations that protect even more of New York’s sensitive          and sacred lands. In 2000, at least 86 land trusts were active in New          York. Like the Nature Conservancy, the land trusts own nature preserves          and easements that permanently restrict the development of private property.[98]                 The public’s interest in outdoor adventure exploded in the 1970s,          and groups devoted to hiking and recreation grew to meet the new demand.          Between 1964 and 1974, the Adirondack Mountain Club started 12 new chapters          that stretched from Niagara Falls to northern New Jersey.[99] Trout Unlimited,          a national organization that protects wild rivers, has 37 chapters in          New York. In 2000, Ducks Unlimited signed an agreement with federal, state,          and local governments to restore up to 10,000 acres of wetlands on Long          Island.[100]          In addition to the national organizations, dozens of statewide and local          groups emerged during the 1970s and 1980s. Many were ad hoc organizations          organized in response to a crisis, such as the Citizens Committee to Save          Cayuga Lake, which was formed in the late 1960s to monitor plans for a          nuclear power plant. But even the most rural areas of New York now have          permanent citizen’s groups. Each county has a Conservation Commission          or an Environmental Management Council (EMC), usually staffed by volunteers,          to coordinate public and private action on behalf of the land. The St.          Lawrence County Board of Legislators created its EMC in 1971 to promote          ""the preservation and improvement of the quality of the natural and          man-made environment"" by ""fostering unified action on environmental          problems among local governments and among public and private agencies          and organizations."" The group’s 15 members include five educators,          two law enforcement officers, a wildlife biologist, and a heavy-equipment          operator.[101]          Most of the money that runs the environmental movement comes from membership          dues and small contributions. But foundation and corporate giving has          been central to the success of many groups, particularly in the early          years. In 1971, for example, a $285,000 grant from the Ford Foundation          was critical to the survival of Environmental Defense. New York City,          the undisputed center of the grant-making world, is home to many foundations          that loyally assist the movement. The biggest donor in 1990 was the Ford          Foundation, in midtown Manhattan, which gave $13 million to environmental          causes. The Rockefeller Foundation, a few blocks away, gave $11 million.          Many other New York foundations also have environmental leanings. The          Beinecke Foundation of Rye gave more than $250,000 to the NRDC and $200,000          to the Open Space Institute in 1990. That same year, the Mary Flagler          Cary Trust of New York City gave $295,000 to the Sierra Club Legal Defense          Fund.[102]         One of the most influential forces in the world of environmental funding          operates from a small office at 437 Madison Avenue. Since 1987, the Environmental          Grantmakers Association has held annual retreats where activists and funders          court each other and discuss long-range strategies. Over 160 foundations          belonged to the Association in 1993. In 2000, the Association also maintained          working groups on such topics as sustainable agriculture, the economy,          transportation, minorities, toxic waste, and growth management. [103]                 Law groups, activist groups, foundations, and smaller donors have developed          well-organized systems that can act rapidly to protect land and pass environmental          legislation around the globe. To a great extent, the headquarters of this          cartel is in New York City.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Energy and Economics          The battle over the Storm King plant was important not only to legal          history. It also came at the beginning of a debate over energy and how          to provide enough of it to New York City and the rest of the country.          As the debate continued, more New Yorkers began considering alternatives          to the ""official solution"" of increasing the number of plants          fired by oil, coal, and nuclear fuel. Rather than accepting the idea that          the state’s supply of electrical energy had to increase forever,          activists began exploring the potential for conservation and renewable          sources.         Consolidated Edison built several large power plants in the 1950s and          1960s in an attempt to keep up with the rising demand for electricity          in New York City. These included the first privately owned nuclear power          plants in the US, at the Hudson River town of Buchannan. When these reactors          (known to most people as Indian Point) opened in 1962, they proved far          less successful than promised. A large supply of river water was needed          for cooling the plant, and the intake pipes occasionally crushed large          numbers of fish. The water returned to the Hudson was 18 degrees warmer          than the natural river water had been, and the difference produced a temperature          shock that killed more fish. Then a pipe leading to the reactor cracked,          and the plant was closed for repairs for most of 1970.         Public opposition to the Storm King pumped water storage project centered          around the negative impact the project would have on scenery, but there          was also a larger issue. In 1969, Con Edison announced that it needed          to add 6,000 megawatts of generating capacity over the next decade. It          proposed that 5,000 of those megawatts come from new plants located along          the Hudson River, most of them nuclear. The prospect of a dozen new power          plants warming the river, combined with similar expansion plans elsewhere          in the state, helped galvanize the emerging opposition to nuclear power.          A group of citizens began collecting information and challenging official          statements about Indian Point (in 2000, this group was still active as          The Indian Point Project). On Long Island, the SHAD Alliance waged a protracted          and successful battle against the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)          to stop a proposed nuclear plant at Shoreham. In Ithaca, the Citizens          Committee to Save Cayuga Lake successfully lobbied New York State Electric          and Gas (NYSEG) to switch from nuclear to coal fuel for its plant at Milliken          Station.          Local groups in New York were linked to other anti-nuclear groups through          Ralph Nader’s Critical Mass Project and the Nuclear Information and          Research Service, both in Washington DC.[104] But in September 1979, the          global anti-nuclear movement briefly focused on New York City, where a          group called Musicians for Safe Energy (MUSE) held five days of ""concerts          for a non-nuclear future"" at Madison Square Garden. The bill included          major stars such as Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, and Bonnie Raitt.          It later became a successful record album and film, generating $750,000          and enormous publicity for the cause. One of the chief MUSE organizers          was John Hall, a songwriter and rock musician from Saugerties. He later          became a founder of a local environmental group called the Winston Farm          Alliance, a member of the Ulster County Legislature, and president of          the local school board.[105]         The ""No Nukes"" concerts were a high-water mark in the anti-nuclear          movement. During the 1980s, utilities canceled one nuclear construction          project after another, and in the 1990s they turned to smaller plants          fired by clean-burning natural gas. Negative publicity and protests played          an important role in slowing down the nuclear construction boom, but the          mortal blow was dealt by a combination of science and economics. As scientists          learned more about the potential for accidents and the difficulty of waste          disposal, it became more expensive to build a nuclear plant that would          pass federal licensing requirements. In practice, nuclear fission turned          out to be a tremendously inefficient way to boil water and heat homes.          The energy analyst Amory Lovins famously noted that making electricity          from fission is ""like cutting butter with a chainsaw.""[106]                 When disputes over energy moved into the courtroom, they often turned          on highly technical matters such as whether planned safety equipment was          adequate or whether the projected demand for power was in fact needed.          To match the experts employed by utilities and licensing agencies, the          earliest citizens’ groups turned to academic and amateur physicists,          biologists, and statisticians. In these early salvos of the war of experts,          two New Yorkers were particularly important to the environmentalists.          The first expert is Joanna Underwood. A former New York University professor,          she founded a research organization called INFORM in 1974 and was still          its executive director in 2000. INFORM distributes information on strategies          for pollution control and waste reduction. Their first publication described          the cutting-edge technology of the day for controlling air pollution,          and showed communities how to investigate local problems. Later projects          have addressed subjects ranging from chemical hazards to water use, transportation,          and clean sources of energy.[107]         The other expert was one of the first American scientists to warn the          public about pollution. Barry Commoner is a Brooklyn-born and Columbia-educated          son of Russian immigrants. In the 1950s, as a member of the St. Louis          Committee for Nuclear Information, Commoner collected baby teeth around          the country, analyzed them, and found radioactive isotopes from the fallout          of atomic tests. A brilliant biologist, Commoner also became a scientific          celebrity with popular books on the environmental crisis like  Science          and Survival  (1966) and  The Closing Circle  (1971). In 1980,          he helped organize the Citizen’s Party and ran for President as its          candidate. And in 1981, he returned home to Queens College to direct the          Center for the Biology of Natural Systems. In the 1980s and 1990s, Commoner          oversaw the development of groundbreaking environmental research, including          computer models that could find the sources of dioxin and other airborne          pollutants that end up in the Great Lakes. Models like these proved essential          when citizens challenged plans for incinerators that burned toxic waste          and garbage. In 1987, the Center organized a pilot projects in East Hampton          that recycled and re-sold 85 percent of residential trash. Their success          helped bring large-scale trash recycling to greater New York.          One of Barry Commoner’s simplest and most persuasive points is that          the most successful form of pollution control is to change the ways goods          and services are produced. The most dramatic environmental successes since          1970, such as removing lead from gasoline and banning DDT, involved eliminating          pollutants instead of trying to control them. ""We now know that environmental          pollution is an incurable disease,"" he wrote. ""It can only be          prevented.""         In the 1970s and 1980s, environmental impact statements often listed          the costs and benefits of a proposed action, such as a new power plant.          The ideology behind cost-benefit analysis was that of the free market.          According to economist Milton Friedman, ""the real problem is not          ‘eliminating pollution,’ but trying to establish arrangements          that will yield the ‘right’ amount of pollution: an amount such          that the gain from reducing pollution a bit more just balances the sacrifice          of the other good things . . . that would have to be given up in order          to reduce the pollution.""[108] Commoner refused to accept the idea          of a ‘right’ amount of pollution, and in time he also came to          reject the free market. ""Sustainable development --that is, economic          development that conforms to the principles of ecology -- calls for social          governance of the means of production,"" he wrote.[109]         Commoner courted controversy by linking environmentalism with democratic          socialism, especially when he ran for president against Ronald Reagan.          But his vision of a society that produces no pollution and consumes fewer          goods endures as a challenge to consumerism.         The prevention philosophy took hold in the 1990s, as the reality of global          warming became clear. In May 2000, the state began a four-year ""Green          Building Tax Credit Program"" that reduces the property tax on buildings          that meet strict standards for energy efficiency, indoor air quality,          and the use of construction materials. The National Audubon Society’s          new headquarters building, which opened in Manhattan in the late 1990s,          drew national attention for a design that dramatically cut energy use          during construction and operation. With the tax credit, more builders          will follow suit.          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         The DEC Empire         Since its birthday on Earth Day 1970, the New York State Department of          Environmental Conservation (DEC) has struggled to keep up with an ever-expanding          list of duties. The DEC grew out of the Conservation Department, which          managed natural resource areas such as water supply, hydropower, fish          and game, parks, and forests. The new agency also assumed responsibility          for the quality of the state’s air, water, and land. As the environmental          movement expanded, the DEC expanded with it. In 1970 the agency employed          2,140 people. In 2000 it had 4,000 employees working in eighteen divisions          in Albany, as well as in nine regional offices that divided up the state          by counties.[110]         The DEC has three main functions: natural resource management, environmental          quality protection, and the promotion of public health, safety and recreation.          Its divisions of Fish and Wildlife and Marine Resources are part of the          historic ""core"" of the agency, with a broad mandate. They protect          and manage fish, wildlife and marine species; issue hunting and fishing          licenses; stock ponds and fields with fish and birds; conduct public education          programs and hunter safety courses; protect and restore habitats; provide          public boat launches; and provide access for fishing, hunting and trapping.         The other division with a long pedigree is Lands and Forests, which acquires          and maintains land for public use; manages state forests and the Adirondack          and Catskill forest preserves; promotes use of public and private forest          resources; and educates people about forests. The relatively small Mineral          Resources division regulates and monitors the drilling and production          of oil, natural gas and solution salt; the underground storage of natural          gas and liquefied petroleum gas; and the extraction of rocks and minerals,          including reclamation of affected land.         Five DEC Divisions focus on maintaining and enhancing environmental quality.          The Air Resources division regulates, permits and monitors sources of          air pollution; forecasts ozone and stagnation events; educates the public          about reducing air pollution; and researches atmospheric dynamics, pollution          and emission sources.         The Environmental Remediation division cleans up inactive hazardous waste          sites and abandoned industrial sites, also known as ""brownfields.""          This division also builds wastewater treatment facilities; manages a Spill          Prevention and Response Program; and regulates petroleum and chemical          bulk storage facilities, underground storage tanks, and major oil storage          facilities.         The Pollution Prevention division promotes environmental management strategies          that avoid creating pollution at its source; provides technical assistance          and outreach through conferences, workshops, clearinghouses and publications;          coordinates DEC's integrated facility management program; and coordinates          the State Agency Environmental Audit Program.         The Solid and Hazardous Materials division carries out regulatory programs          for landfills and incinerators. It also manages the state’s policy          toward pesticides and radioactive wastes. It encourages waste reduction,          reuse and recycling, and it provides cancer researchers with a database          on pesticide application and sales.         The Water division protects water quality in lakes, rivers, aquifers          and coastal areas by regulating wastewater discharges, monitoring water          bodies and controlling surface runoff; providing technical assistance          and education; managing freshwater resources; and helping prevent flood          damage and beach erosion.         The DEC also builds and manages a vast network of campgrounds, trails,          and recreational facilities, including the Belleayre Mountain Ski Center          in the Catskills. It operates environmental education centers and summer          environmental camps, produces audiovisual programs, and publishes the           New York State Conservationist  magazine. Because the DEC issues          permits to the industrial users of New York’s water and air, it maintains          its own court system and legal team, and is empowered to collect fines.          It has its own police force, known as Environmental Conservation Officers          (ECOs), who enforce environmental laws, as well as forest rangers, who          fight fires; promote the safe use of the outdoors; license outdoor guides;          and conduct search and rescue missions.         The DEC is the environmental emperor of the Empire State, and the dominant          force in environmental affairs. But it has not always been at the forefront          of change. Much of the DEC’s work was handed to it by laws passed          in Washington DC. Many state laws administered by the DEC are made unnecessary          by stricter local laws. Some DEC programs were created in response to          short-term political pressure from citizens or business groups, not because          of any long-term strategy.          New York’s environmental affairs since 1970 are a complicated story.          Elected officials, civil servants, citizen activists, and business associations          fight to define problems and determine responses. Landowners, business          owners, recreational users, and consumers accept or reject the results.          It is an endless, complex process that unfolds simultaneously on three          levels -- federal, state, and local. What follows are examples of how          this process has worked in several of the most important environmental          areas: solid waste, pesticides, toxic waste, clean water, clean air, wildlife,          open space protection, and the Adirondack Park.          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Solid Waste          In 1970, New Yorkers disposed of their garbage in two ways: burying it          in landfills, or burning it in incinerators. Most of the landfills were          small, leaky dumps, and most of the incinerators were backyard barrels          or apartment smokestacks.          Changes in solid waste management since 1970 are among the state’s          biggest environmental success stories. Today, some New York communities          recycle or re-use half of their garbage. The last landfill in New York          City will close in December 2001, and the number of active landfills elsewhere          in the state is declining. Trash incinerators and burn barrels are increasingly          regulated. The solid waste story shows how small changes in design and          policy can produce big benefits.         In 1973, the state authorized the DEC to develop rules governing landfill          operations. In 1976, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act          required all states to draw up plans for the disposal of their solid waste,          to make inventories of their dumps, and to meet safety standards for disposal.          In 1977, the first state regulations were put on the books to ensure landfill          security, monitor nearby water pollution, and properly seal the contents.          Each landfill’s permit spelled out details specific to the site.          As these regulations increased the cost of operating landfills, the number          of landfills decreased. A growing share of the state’s garbage was          trucked to large regional dumps that served many counties or even many          states.         Environmental groups kept pushing the solid waste issue forward in the          1980s, looking for ways to reduce the waste stream. The DEC began adopting          annual plans for solid waste management in 1980. In 1982, after a statewide          lobbying campaign by the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG),          a ""bottle bill"" was passed requiring a five-cent deposit on          all beer and soda cans sold in the state. But issuing mandates and writing          annual plans are not the same as causing change. New York State was shamed          in 1987, when the garbage barge Mobro from Islip, Long Island spent 156          days at sea and three months at harbor, fully loaded, with no one willing          to accept its rotting cargo.          In 1989, New York City passed a law requiring residents to separate recyclable          materials from their household trash. The city’s trash-collecting          systems have been slow to catch up with the law, so the city’s citizen          groups have been leading the way. For example, in the early 1990s a nonprofit          group called WE CAN collected recyclable materials from Manhattan apartment          buildings, offices, and schools, with the proceeds supporting the homeless.         In 1992, the state DEC required all municipalities in the state to have          source separation programs in place. New York City’s trash system          is still lagging, but its performance is improving. In 1998, the City          recycled 14 percent of its garbage, compared with a state average of 32          percent.[111]         Nationally, the amount of material diverted from landfills and incinerators          by recycling increased 67 percent between 1990 and 1996, from 34 million          to 57 million tons.[112] And as the decade wore on, the emphasis shifted          toward reducing waste instead of recycling it. Often this meant changing          individual behavior. New York City’s Bureau of Waste Prevention,          Reuse, and Recycling produced posters in 1997 to encourage two-sided photocopying,          for example.[113] In Tompkins County, the waste stream was cut dramatically          by combining recycling and public education with a ""pay as you throw""          tax that required households to buy adhesive tags that go on garbage cans.         One result of the shift in behavior was fewer landfills. Tompkins County          was able to cancel a planned new landfill because of its new policy, and          switch to a regional dump instead. New York had planned to build a large          garbage incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard that would burn more than          3,000 tons of garbage a day, plus four more in other city boroughs. None          of these were built. The City still produced12 million tons of garbage          a year in the late 1990s, but most of it went to a huge incinerator in          Bridgeport, Connecticut or a regional landfill in West Virginia.          As more and more urban garbage was shipped to industrial incinerators          and rural landfills, new problems emerged. One issue was transfer stations,          which are factory-like buildings where the refuse in city garbage trucks          and barges is moved to rail cars and tractor-trailers. Low-income neighborhoods          are the most common sites for these stations and other urban facilities          that have negative environmental impacts. At one time, the Red Hook neighborhood          of Brooklyn had 12 waste transfer stations, 10 petroleum distributors,          a trash incinerator, the Brooklyn Battery tunnel, and warehouses full          of toxic waste.[114]         In 1993, an EPA research paper confirmed what community activists had          long been saying: that minority communities were exposed to pollution          at much higher rates than white communities. Some working-class neighborhoods          had already been resisting this trend for decades. Between 1967 and 1977,          for example, residents of Hoboken, New Jersey turned back a half-dozen          attempts to build new oil refineries and chemical plants near the town.                 On most environmental issues, the activists are middle-class or wealthy          white people. But toxic waste made an exception. In Hoboken, working-class          black and white leaders from a variety of ethnic backgrounds united in          defense of the community. Many activists who got their start in the Civil          Rights movement switched to organizing for environmental action in working          class areas, and the movement soon gained a name: eco-justice.         In the mid-1990s, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest (NYLPI) began          organizing low-income neighborhoods that were affected by transfer stations          and other hazardous sites. New York City had 85 private waste transfer          stations in 1998 that exported 24,000 tons of garbage a day. Sixty of          these stations were located in neighborhoods where blacks, Latinos, and          other minorities are a majority of the population. The stations brought          with them unhealthy concentrations of diesel fumes, water pollution, rodents,          and foul odors. Neighborhood activists argued that there was a connection          between these sites and local residents’ high rates of asthma.          In 1997, NYLPI helped start the Organization of Waterfront Neighborhoods,          a coalition of 26 community groups from affected neighborhoods. The group          quickly succeeded in blocking a proposed transfer station and holding          public hearings in their neighborhoods. In 2000, it had become a player          in New York’s ongoing legal battle over solid waste management. ""A          community does not plan to fail,"" wrote NYLPI organizer Eddie Bautista.          ""It fails to plan.""[115]         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Pesticides         ""A spray like DDT makes people think of a continent arranged like          a manicured garden, but you can’t kick nature around that way,""          said John Baker, president of the National Audubon Society, in an interview          published in  The New Yorker  in 1945. Over the next 20 years, the          liberal use of DDT and other pesticides wreaked havoc on frogs, birds,          fish, and snakes. It also poisoned the mammals that ate them, slowly and          silently.          New York was the center of the movement to control pesticide use. It          was  The New Yorker  that alerted the country to the pesticide crisis          in 1962, when Rachel Carson published a series of articles that became          the book  Silent Spring . The Manhattan-based National Audubon Society          took on the cause after Rachel Carson died in 1964, going on the record          against DDT at its annual meeting in 1967. The Long Island-based Environmental          Defense Fund, aided by Audubon, started the legal action that culminated          in a nationwide ban on DDT. Audubon immediately began working to restore          the damage. In the 1980s, the group supported a successful Cornell University          program to breed and release endangered Peregrine Falcons.          State controls on pesticides were established in July 1970, and DDT was          banned in the state in 1971. In 1972, the federal Insecticide, Fungicide,          and Rodenticide act authorized national regulations on pesticide use,          throwing the industry and activists into the arena of battling experts.          In this arena, being right was not enough. You also had to be in the room,          and public advocates were not guaranteed admission. In 1979, the DEC assumed          authority for the 1972 federal act and began certifying some 32,000 farmers,          landscapers, and other applicators. This was a win for environmental advocates,          because in most states pesticides were still regulated by agriculture          departments. But in 1980, at proceedings aimed at revising pesticide regulations,          the DEC included representatives from pesticide manufacturers, farmers,          and state agencies on its committee. But delegates from citizens’          groups were not allowed, on grounds that the DEC already represented them          effectively.[116]         Further regulations were placed on pesticides in 1983, and in 1987 the          state banned the use of chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor. In          1993, the DEC also agreed to enforce the EPA’s new standards for          farm worker protection.          Meanwhile, New York scientists began finding ways of controlling pests          with fewer or no synthetic chemicals. Cornell University’s Integrated          Pest Management Support Group, based in Geneva, teaches New York farmers          how to use inter-planting, targeted applications, and new plant varieties          to dramatically reduce their chemical use. The technique offers farmers          a way to save money while maintaining their yield and using less pesticide.          No pesticide is the goal of the Northeast Organic Farmers Association,          which has a New York chapter and nine local groups across the state.[117]          NOFA was founded in the 1980s to certify organic farms and serve strong          consumer demand for pesticide-free food. The story is another example          of how state leaders have shifted their strategy from controlling pollution          control to preventing it entirely.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Toxic Waste         New York’s struggle to remove toxic chemicals from its soil, air,          and water goes far beyond pesticides. Some toxic chemicals proved impossible          to eliminate from industry. Others were dumped indiscriminately before          their dangers were known. As New York’s industrial jobs left in the          1970s and 1980s, the industries left the state with a multi-billion dollar          cleanup project.         In a few instances, the state was able to register dramatic and rapid          improvements as soon as it recognized a toxic waste problem. In 1971,          for example, the DEC reported a 97 percent reduction in discharges of          mercury into water because of simple controls. But victories like these          were the exception. From the Niagara River to the Gowanus Canal, New Yorkers          have engaged in epic battles over how to clean up their messes.         Among the state’s many horror stories of toxic waste, Love Canal          is the one that stands out. On August 10, 1977,  Niagara Falls Gazette           reporter Michael Brown published the first front-page story about this          working-class neighborhood. Brown, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his efforts,          drew the world’s attention to the slimy black ooze from an abandoned          dump that was coming back to the surface. A playground, basements, and          back yards were sinking into potholes full of benzene and other chemicals          from an abandoned Hooker Chemical plant. Miscarriages, leukemia, and childhood          diseases were rampant in the neighborhood. Love Canal became a symbol          of upstate New York’s decline, and a warning to the world about toxic          wastes.          Four pieces of federal legislation set the rules for New York’s          contentious cleanup. In 1976, The Toxic Substances Control Act required          manufacturers to report to the EPA on the hazardous effect of their chemicals          and mixtures, and authorized the EPA to restrict the use of these substances.          Also in 1976, The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act established a          federal hazardous waste management program but allowed states to take          over the problem once they set up their own agencies. New York enacted          its hazardous waste control program in 1978, just as the storm was breaking          at Love Canal.          The third major piece of toxic waste legislation was Superfund, or the          Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.          This was passed in 1980 to provide some of the massive funds that were          needed to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites, including          Love Canal and 79 others in New York. By the time the state received federal          approval for their program in 1986, New York’s voters had approved          a $1.2 billion state Superfund to complemented the federal fund. Half          of the $1.2 billion came from fees on industry, and half from taxpayers.                 The fourth plank in the legal platform was the Occupational Safety and          Health Act of 1970 (OSHA). It authorized the Secretary of Labor to set          health and safety standards for the workplace, and safe treatment of toxic          substances became a major focus of the law. OSHA was the culmination of          the Industrial Hygiene movement of the 1930s and 1940. It aroused vehement          opposition from businesses that complained of arbitrary and unreasonable          rules. It continues to be a lightning rod for controversy. But statistics          show that it has made the workplace safer.          Reviewing three of the major toxic problems in New York -- lead, PCBs,          and radioactive waste – is a quick way to understand the difficulty          and expense of this problem.                    Lead:  Physicians have long known that inhaling or ingesting            lead particles can cause major health problems, including mental retardation            in children. By the 1960s, it was clear that adding lead to gasoline            was causing a pollution crisis that could be prevented. In the early            1970s, motor vehicles poured 3,000 tons of lead a year into the air            above New York City. The first New York controls on lead were not adopted            until 1971, however, when the City adopted a gradual phase-out of sales            of leaded gasoline in the five boroughs. Federal regulations spurred            by the Clean Air Act began a national phase-out of leaded gasoline in            1973, but automobile companies fought the rules vigorously. In 1982,            the Reagan administration even proposed rescinding the rules so that            lead could stay in gasoline. It took a major outcry from scientists            to keep the phase-out moving and three more years before 95 percent            of lead was removed from the nation’s fuel pumps.            As the 15-year fight raged over leaded gasoline, public concern also            turned to leaded paint. The sale of most leaded paints was banned by            the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1977, but an estimated 27            million older housing units in New York had lead paint on their walls            when the law took effect. In the late 1980s, about 1,000 New York City            children a year were found with elevated lead levels in their blood            because they ate paint chips or inhaled lead in dust. The problem was            heavily concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. State and local laws            now require building owners to cover lead paint and disclose its presence            to new home buyers, but it will be decades before this everyday hazard            goes away.            PCBs:  Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used for decades            as insulating fluids in electrical equipment. They were also mixed into            paints, adhesives, and dyes. Exposure to this chemical can cause skin            eruptions, liver damage, and nervous system disorders. PCBs are also            suspected of contributing to birth defects and cancer. When burned,            they may be converted into dioxin, among the world’s most toxic            substances. They are also very stable chemicals that can persist for            years. Therein lies the problem.           Starting in 1947, General Electric dumping more than 500,000 pounds            of PCBs, along with other by-products, into the Hudson River north of            Albany. The Department of Environmental Conservation finally forced            GE to stop in 1975. Most of the toxins were deposited in the silt along            a 40-mile stretch of river, but some were carried as far south as New            York Harbor. Ever since then, Hudson River fish have been severely contaminated            by PCBs. Most commercial fishing on the Hudson was banned in 1976. A            national ban on PCBs was enacted in 1977. The DEC first proposed a plan            to remove the contaminated sediment in 1978. But it quickly became the            captive of endless hearings, court claims, and counter-claims.            General Electric has insisted that the problem of PCBs in the Hudson            River is not a pressing matter, and that it is doing what needs to be            done to fix the PCB problem. According to Melvin Schweiger, former Senior            Engineer and head of GE's Hudson River Project, GE has spent $165 million            so far on PCB science, investigations, and studies, in addition to the            costs to fix the actual PCB problem. The efforts made by GE include            removing 132 tons of PCB's from the plant sites at Hudson Falls and            Fort Edward, putting in approximately 230 wells to control groundwater            flow, and capping 60 acres of shoreline.[118]           One result of the state’s protracted public battle with GE has            been the growth of several powerful environmental organizations along            the Hudson. These include Riverkeeper, Scenic Hudson, and Clearwater,            which was founded by folk singer Pete Seeger in 1966. Clearwater tries            to improve public access to the river, improve the quality of the water,            and help the Hudson provide safe food. Clearwater also conducts many            festivals that attract thousands of river-lovers. Its 106-foot replica            of a Hudson River sloop is the only one of its kind.[119]            PCBs were also the cause of a strange disaster in Binghamton. In 1981,            an electrical fire broke out in a brand-new, never-occupied state office            building in the center of town. Burning PCBs in basement transformers            spread dioxin-laced smoke through the building, making it uninhabitable.            It took over a decade for the state to figure out what to do with the            building, and several years to clean it. The building finally opened            in the mid-1990s.           Radioactive waste:  The disposal of radioactive waste is not            as big a problem in New York as it is in other states, mainly because            New York depends less on nuclear power. But radioactive waste is a potent            political issue, and state lawmakers have been aggressive in attacking            the problem. The DEC began regulating radioactive discharges and radioactive            waste in April 1974. After newspapers published sensational stories            about West Valley in Cattaragus County, the state’s only commercial            high-level radioactive waste burial site, the DEC closed it in 1975.            Since then, the high-level radioactive wastes produced by power plants            have been stored near the plants. Low-level wastes have been strictly            regulated, and the state has monitored both processes. In 1982, the            state Health Department took over programs that measure radiation levels            in the environment.                 Beginning with Love Canal, New Yorkers have learned a hard lesson: the          short-term profit gained by abandoning hazardous wastes has to be repaid,          over and over again, in cleanup costs. In 2000, the state’s Superfund          ran out of money after tackling 401 of the state’s estimated 864          inactive hazardous waste sites. Keeping Superfund going will cost the          state from $130 million to $250 million a year, with no end in sight.          Illicit dumping of hazardous wastes is aggressively prosecuted by the          DEC, but it is still a problem, particularly among small manufacturers          in New York City.          Today, New Yorkers are among the nation’s most knowledgeable experts          on the subject of toxic waste. Lois Gibbs, the Niagara Falls housewife          who lead the protests of Love Canal residents, has become the nation’s          leading citizen activist on toxic wastes. As chair of the Center for Health,          Environment and Justice, located in Falls Church, Virginia, Gibbs provides          advice and support to activists around the country.[120]          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Clean Water         On July 1, 1976, an oil barge hit a pylon of the Tappan Zee Bridge and          dumped 50,000 gallons of number 2 oil into the Hudson River. Given the          indignities the river had already endured, the oil spill wasn’t much.          But it was the last straw for New Yorkers who were tired of living next          to fouled water. Over the next 25 years, the state and citizen’s          groups made significant progress in cleaning it up.          New York’s first clean water legislation was passed in the 19 th           Century, and several significant efforts were made before 1970 to protect          drinking water supplies and regulate sewage. In 1965, for example, Nelson          Rockefeller’s Pure Waters Bond Act released $300 million in state          funds for wastewater treatment – and in 1965, $300 million was a          lot of money. The process gained a great deal more money and power in          1972, when the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments, known as the          Clean Water Act, set a national water policy for the first time. The act          set effluent limits for sewage plants, established the National Pollution          Discharge Elimination System, and financed wastewater treatment plants.          Federal standards were actually relaxed in amendments to the Clean Water          Act in 1977, but New York went in the opposite direction: the state passed          11 clean-water bills in the 1970s, and another 12 in the 1980s.[121]          In a 1996 bond act, voters authorized a major expansion of clean water          initiatives, including $790 million for wastewater and habitat restoration          and $355 million for safe drinking water. Here are three examples of New          York’s innovative solutions to water problems                    New York City Sewage:  New York City has had sewage treatment            plants since the 1930s, but until 1992 its sludge was dumped into the            ocean. The North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, on the Hudson River            in Manhattan’s upper West Side, has helped to change that. Since            it opened in 1986, the massive plant has treated about 1.4 billion gallons            of sewage a day, including much of the raw sewage that once poured into            the river during storm overflows. The plant has a state park built on            top of its treatment tanks, including three swimming pools, a restaurant,            and sports fields. To replace ocean dumping, the city also developed            a new process so that it could sell treated sludge, or ""biosolids,""            as agricultural fertilizer.            Drinking water:  In 1989, the EPA issued rules requiring most            municipal drinking water supplies to install expensive filtration systems.            The drinking water supplies in New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, and            other cities are not filtered, and city leaders were eager to avoid            the bill. The EPA rules said that no filtration system would be required            if a municipality could demonstrate that it had a stringent program            to protect its watersheds, and if its water met high standards.            After years of hard negotiation with several dozen townships in the            Catskills and Hudson Valley, New York City met those standards with            a voluntary agreement signed on January 21, 1997. The agreement included            plans to update nine upstate sewage plants, and to renovate dams and            reservoirs. It also included a $35 million Agricultural Program designed            to preserve the watershed region’s farm economy. On a smaller scale,            the City of Syracuse worked with the Finger Lakes Land Trust to safeguard            lands that drained into Skaeneateles Lake, its primary drinking water            source. In the future, voluntary agreements may also be used to safeguard            the watersheds of Hemlock and Canadice Lakes, which supply drinking            water to Rochester.           Watershed protection:  A statewide movement that began in the            1970s has permanently protected thousands of acres of sensitive coastal            areas and wetlands. Protecting parkland has always been popular with            the public, but the movement really picked up speed in the 1990s when            setting aside wetlands and coastal areas proved cost-effective as well.           Jamaica Bay lies between Brooklyn and Coney Island, is one of the last            undeveloped stretches of New York City’s 578-mile coastline. The            13,000-acre bay, which is home to more than 300 species of birds, was            handed over to the National Parks Service in 1972 and re-named the Gateway            National Recreation Area. The following year, Fire Island became a National            Seashore and was saved from housing and road development. Storm damage            to beach houses elsewhere in Long Island showed the wisdom of preventing            construction on a sand bar.           In 1972, the federal Coastal Zone Management Act encouraged states            to develop coastal areas only where their impacts would not be harmful            to the environment. In 1980, the DEC responded by submitting a management            program for the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence River, Hudson River, and the            state’s marine coast. In 1982, it also commissioned a survey to            determine the impact of acid rain on Adirondack lakes. In 1984, the            state began issuing water quality reports every two years. In 1993,            it issued a $2.7 million grant to begin a long, difficult clean up of            Onondaga Lake. And in 1994, it approved a comprehensive plan for the            clean up of Long Island Sound.                  One of the most effective state expenditures for clean water came in          1993, and then the DEC helped fund Water Quality Coordinating Committees          in 57 New York counties. In the 1990s, citizens’ watershed organizations          like the Seneca Pure Waters Association have become effective watchdogs          of water quality across the state.         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Clean Air         Giving an order doesn’t necessarily make something happen. This          is the lesson of the federal Clean Air Act of 1970, which required the          nation to set and meet air quality standards. Revised in 1977 and 1990,          this law guided the process that eliminated lead from gasoline, cut automotive          emissions of carbon monoxide and other pollutants, and cleaned up the          nation’s smokestacks. But what it really did was set the rules for          a battle that is now entering its fourth decade. One of the reasons this          battle has been so slow is that it often involves automobiles, and Americans          are loath to give up their cars.          The Clean Air Act set general standards. It was filled in by a series          of state and federal laws and amendments. But its provisions were often          not enforced until someone insisted on it. In 1973, a Clean Air Plan was          drafted for New York City. The Plan sat on a shelf until 1975, when lawyers          Ross Sandler and David Schoenbrod filed suit on behalf of several environmental          groups to enforce it. The legal fight went all the way to the Supreme          Court, where it was decided in favor of the plaintiffs. The compromise          plan established bus lanes and strengthened the enforcement of traffic          and parking laws. Since the plan was put in place, carbon monoxide levels          on New York streets have declined.         The list of clean air laws is exceptionally long. Here are a few highlights:          in 1971, a state law established emission standards for industrial plants.          In 1972, eight significant pollutants were added to the list of chemicals          used to measure air quality standards. In 1976, the DEC controlled the          use of aerosol cans containing chloroflurocarbons (CFCs), which had been          shown to damage the planet’s ozone layer. In 1983, cowls were added          to gasoline pumps in New York City to keep vapor from escaping into the          air. In 1985, municipal solid waste incinerators were regulated. In 1986,          the state inherited a long list of duties previously reserved by Washington.                 New York’s air is measurably cleaner because of these laws. But          it isn’t clean enough. This was brought home in 1988, when hot summer          weather contributed to heavy atmospheric ozone and unhealthy breathing          conditions in several New York cities. So the legal beat went on. In 1990,          New York adopted California’s automobile emission standards, by far          the strictest in the nation, for all cars sold in the state. Also in 1990,          further amendments to the Clean Air Act required major polluters to get          permits before they could release chemicals into the air. These were combined          with several ""market-based"" provisions, including ""pollution          allowances"" that can be bought and sold and credits to industries          that meet certain standards.          Despite these efforts, one of the state’s most serious air pollution          problems seems to be getting worse. Acid rain, which is caused by fine          particles from Midwestern smokestacks wafting northward, is having a major          negative impact statewide, killing plant, fish, and animals. Acid rain’s          component chemicals were controlled within New York by a 1984 law. But          the problem lies in Ohio, Michigan, and other states where environmental          traditions are not as strong as they are in New York. For decades, the          state has been unable to force its neighbors to stop. According to Attorney          General Elliot Spitzer, an estimated one-fifth of lakes in the Adirondacks          are too acidic to support life.          Another reason for the lack of progress in stopping acid rain is the          complexity of the issue, which has provided many points at which scientific          questions could be disputed. Beginning in 1978, power companies, smelters,          and other acid rain generators adopted the strategy of continually calling          for more scientific research. Once scientific research reached a consensus          that acid rain was harmful and should be controlled, the industries switched          to a public-relations campaign against the scientists.[122]          In 1999, Attorney General Spitzer filed suit against 17 older coal-fired          power plants in the Midwest, claiming that they had made major modifications          without obtaining the necessary permits. In May 2000, he also gave notice          to file suit against seven coal-fired plants in New York.          Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Wildlife and open space         Ecology, which for decades had been a neglected stepchild of the sciences,          finally got some respect in the 1970s. Ecological terms like ""biodiversity""          and ""carrying capacity"" entered the ordinary person’s reading          list. Scientists began using ecological management techniques to restore          damaged areas and re-introduce wild animals to areas where they had been          wiped out. Combined with these trends, New York’s forest cover increased          steadily through the last quarter of the 20 th  century. There          was rapid growth in public use and appreciation of natural areas. Responding          to the increased interest, the state embarked on a major expansion of          land holdings in the 1990s.         In July 1971, New York’s first state endangered animal protection          law was enacted. Two years later, the federal Endangered Species Act passed,          and in 1974 endangered plants were added to the list. Protecting these          animals fell to the DEC, and they came upon an innovative way of finding          the money. In 1982, New York state tax returns began including a ""return          a gift to wildlife"" feature, which allows taxpayers to make voluntary          payments into a wildlife protection fund. In 1998, the feature raised          $600,000.         It was comparatively easy to save endangered species in most of New York,          because large sections of the state have smaller human populations in          2000 than they had in 1970. Outside of the state’s metropolitan corridors,          former farms are turning back into forests, the population is aging, and          human impact on the land is stable or declining. Open space protection          is therefore different in New York than it is in California or Florida.          Advocates here had an opportunity to protect entire ecosystems west of          the Hudson and north of Albany with relatively little public opposition,          and at a relatively low cost.         The DEC used its wildlife funds in a variety of ways, including the re-introduction          of many species wiped out early in the 20 th  century. Fishers          were released in the Catskills in 1976. Wild turkeys were released across          the state in 1979 and have staged a stunning comeback; they are now a          popular game bird for hunters, and are common from the Alleghenies to          Long Island. In 1980, the DEC began work on a comprehensive breeding bird          atlas of New York State, with the assistance of Cornell University’s          Lab of Ornithology. The atlas has become indispensable in environmental          analyses and planning. In 1989, a 13-year program concluded to re-introduce          bald eagles to New York when 10 nesting pairs were confirmed in the state.          In 1992, Lake Sturgeon were re-introduced in the Oswegatchie and Grass          rivers of the Adirondacks, and osprey nests were placed in the Tonawanda          Wildlife Management Area. In 1994, the number of nesting bald eagle pairs          had increased to 23.         Important wildlife habitat was protected statewide in 1971, when Agricultural          Districts were created to protect rural farmland from developers. But          the real push to protect habitat came from outdoor enthusiasts, who became          a major political force in New York in the 1970s. In 1975, the state added          1,000 miles of rivers in the Adirondacks to the national wild and scenic          rivers program. Also in 1975, Theodore Hullar and other New York environmentalists          proposed that the Delaware Water Gap become a park instead of being flooded          by a dam on Tocks Island. Eventually that stretch of the Delaware was          also added to the scenic rivers system, and the dam was stopped. The New          York/New Jersey Trails Commission, the Finger Lakes Trail Association,          and other hiking clubs also weighed in whenever open space became available          along their routes.          A major advance came in June 1992, when the DEC submitted the first of          its annual Open Space Plans to the governor. Open space plans include          lists of lands that the state will acquire if and when they become available.          With funds from Bond Acts passed in 1986 and 1996, the state gained the          money it needed. As a result, many in-holdings in state forests were consolidated,          wetlands were saved, and forests protected.         Return to Table of Contents         Adirondacks         A politician who wants to dodge a problem often appoints a commission          to study the problem and release a report. In 1968, Nelson Rockefeller          appointed the Temporary Study Commission on the Future of the Adirondacks.          The problem was the use of privately owned land within the blue line,          which comprises the majority of the Park. Development pressure was increasing.          In 1967, the Great Northern Corporation began selling a subdivision of          300 building lots near Indian Lake, with some lots as small as one-quarter          of an acre. The Governor’s brother, Laurence Rockefeller, had already          proposed turning the core of the state Park into a National Park, with          the tacit assumption that land outside the National Park would be developed          with no special requirements. The National Park proposal did not fly,          but it got people excited – and in the Adirondacks, it re-opened          old wounds about the relationship between state government, old money,          and working people who live on the land.          Regulating the private land in a public park was a mess that could have          been solved in 1894, when the park was created, or 1915, when it was reaffirmed.          But politicians sidestepped the problem then. Rockefeller might also have          been sidestepping it in 1968. But if he was, he had misjudged Harold Hochschild.         Hochschild was a millionaire businessman whose family had owned a great          camp on Blue Mountain Lake since 1904. He later became the founder and          main benefactor of the Adirondack Museum, one of the nation’s finest          regional museums, also in Blue Mountain Lake. He was appointed to the          study commission in 1968, and things went as expected, with little action,          until he assumed the Chairman’s position in 1970. Rockefeller asked          the Commission to recommend ways to assure that development on private          land [within the blue line] is consistent with the long-range well-being          of the area."" Their report, released in December 1970, pulled no          punches. ""Unguided development on the 3,500,000 acres of private          land will destroy the character of the entire Park if immediate action          is not taken."" The commission recommended further expansion of the          Park’s boundaries, to more than 5.9 million acres, and it also recommended          that the legislature establish an Adirondack Park Agency (APA) to develop          regional zoning for private land.          The Hochschild commission report fell squarely within the tradition of          wealthy landowners defending an unspoiled landscape from entrepreneurs.          In the 19 th  century, the despoilers were loggers and railroad          men; in the 20 th  and 21 st  century, they are housing          developers. Small businesses and local workers complained that the report          did not represent their interests, but it was a compelling argument outside          the Blue Line. In June 1971, Rockefeller’s bill that established          the APA was passed into law. Rockefeller approved the Agency’s master          plan for state-owned land in 1972. In 1973, just before he left to become          Vice-President, Rockefeller approved the agency’s Private Land Use          and Development Plan.          The Private Land plan color-coded every acre of land within the blue          line and assigned it a permissible level of development. In most of the          private land (53 percent), no more than ten housing units per square mile          could be built, on an average lot size of 64 acres. The overall goal was          to protect the park’s character as a forested place. The immediate          outcome was outrage from local landowners that felt that their rights          had been stolen. In 1975, speakers at rallies held by the League for Adirondack          Citizens Rights called the APA a ""fascist bureaucracy"" and burned          Agency members in effigy.          The long tradition of local opposition to state control the Adirondacks          has continued unabated since the mid-Nineteenth Century. It flared up          again during the formation of the APA, and continues into the present          day. In December 1989, when the DEC closed the road to Crane Pond, local          residents removed the barriers to re-gain access to their traditional          fishing spots. When environmentalists tried to put the barriers back in          place, a scuffle broke out that was broadcast nationally on the program          ""60 Minutes.""          The APA did put regulations in place that controlled some housing development          in the Adirondacks. But through the 1970s and 1980s, conservationists          warned that developments perfectly legal under the APA guidelines were          still eroding the forested character of the park. In 1989, after a powerful          article in the New York Times called attention to the Adirondack building          boom, Governor Cuomo appointed a new commission, called the Commission          on the Adirondacks in the Twenty-First Century, to revisit the problem.          In 1990, the commission reiterated what Hochschild had said twenty years          earlier: that development was threatening the character of the Park. This          time, opposition to the report became the rallying cry for those who believed          in home rule for the Adirondacks. The Adirondack Fairness Commission,          funded by local businesses, claimed that evidence of a crisis had been          fabricated. The Adirondack Solidarity Alliance organized a ""freedom          drive"" that created gridlock on the Northway. The report was dead          on arrival, and housing development continued in the Adirondacks through          the 1990s.[123]         Meanwhile, the state pursued opportunities to add large sections of the          Park to its holdings through acquisitions and easements. In 1998, the          state purchased 14,800 acres of prime lake country, including Little Tupper          Lake, from the Whitney family for more than $100 million. Several other          large parcels are under consideration in 2000. The Sierra Club and other          groups are promoting the idea of a Great Oswegatchie Wilderness, a 400,000-acre          swath of state land in the western central part of the park. The vision          of a great unbroken forest lives on.[124]         Go to Endnotes         Return to Table of Contents         Conclusion          In a few years, it will be impossible to write a paper about ""environmental          affairs"" as a separate subject, because this topic is rapidly being          integrated into every aspect of private and public life. Organized groups          run the gamut from one extreme to the other. The Cenozoic Society of Canton,          New York wants to remove all human influences from millions of acres in          the North Country.[125] The Property Rights Foundation of America in Stony          Creek, a few miles away, argues that land protection groups are part of          a global conspiracy to install world government, led by the United Nations.[126]          Everyone in between is seeking some kind of balance between the environment          and economic growth.          The vast majority of New Yorkers view environmental affairs comfortably,          as one concern among the many concerns of daily living. New York’s          state and federal legislators glean high ratings from the League of Conversation          Voters and the Environmental Protection Lobby year after year because          the voters demand it. Voters regularly approve bond issues that contribute          to the state’s high taxes, as long as the debt finances new water          treatment plants and new parks. What has changed is size, as the state’s          population has grown from 340,000 in 1790 to more than 18 million in 2000.          There have also been changes in scope, as New York has passed from being          an agricultural empire to an industrial powerhouse and, in 2000, a capital          of global finance. But the will of the people has not changed. Every time          they are asked to pay the price for clean air, clean water, and open space,          New Yorkers pay it willingly.

GX270-95-3106143	"Learn About Javelina Reprinted from Texas Parks & Wildlife Magazine, June 1974  By J.E. Ellisor, Wildlife Biologist The javelina, or collared peccary, has always been placed in the shadow of the white-tailed deer by Texas hunters, but in recent years interest in this much ignored game animal has greatly increased. Biologists with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have conducted several studies to obtain information needed to manage this species, but there is still much to be learned. The answers to the following commonly asked questions were obtained from studies conducted with marked javelina herds in South Texas. Is the javelina really a pig? Although students of scientific classification do not agree on the scientific name for this animal-it is currently known as either Tayassu tajacu or Dicotyles tajacu-they are certain it doesn't belong in the same family as domestic hogs and wild boars. Such features as having only one dew claw on the hind foot and four teats, with only two being functional, exclude the javelina from the swine family.  How long do javelina live? This is a question we can presently answer only with an educated guess. Some of the animals originally marked for movement studies in 1965 were observed 9 years later. The educated guess would be that a javelina's life expectancy in the wild is about 10 years. What do they eat? Like their swine relatives, javelinas are omnivorous, meaning they eat almost anything available. Nevertheless, studies in Texas and Arizona have proven the importance of prickly pear cactus to the javelina. On almost all ranges, this succulent plant provides more than half of its diet while fulfilling most of its water requirements. This thorny diet, low in nutrients, is supplemented by green forbs, vines and grasses. Aside from scooting a prickly pear leaf along the ground to break some of the longer thorns, the javelina pays little attention to the numerous spines on its favorite snack.   Will supplemental feeding help? As with any wild animal, supplemental feeding can be detrimental to javelina. If such feeding is done during periods of stress, usually occurring during droughts or after severe winter weather, it will improve the chances of survival and reproduction in a javelina herd. But this only foils nature's attempts to limit the number of wild animals to the carrying capacity of the habitat. Supplemental feeding can increase this capacity if other life requirements such as cover are adequate, but if supplemental feeding is ever terminated, the range is left with more animals than it can support. What can I do to increase the number of javelina on my land? Javelina need food and dense brush for cover. Increase either or both aud you increase the capacity for that range to support javelina. The den se st javelina populations are invariably found where prickly pear is abundant, so an increase in this cactus would be a prerequisite to any increase in javelina. However, most ranchers are not that fond of prickly pear. Although it has carried many a cow through a dry winter, prickly pear is still considered an invader on improved ranges. Javelina are also dependent on thick brush which they use as cover during the hot summer days. Whitebrush or bee brush thickets are favored in South Texas, but many times javelina use dense stands of blackbrush. In the Hill Country, cedar brakes offer protection. The requirements for javelina are in conflict with many of the principals of range improvements being advocated and, if you really want javelina, you must take their habitat needs into consideration when any ""improvements"" are planned. Are javelina harmful to the range? Javelina do have some habits that might be considered harmful to some range improvement programs. To some extent, the animals spread the growth of prickly pear during their feeding activities, and a herd wilI muddy stock water during hot summer months when they use stock tanks as wallows. However, javelina probably do more to control prickly pear than many methods used by man because of the tremendous importance of this cactus in their diet. Javelina compete very little with cattle and, since these animals can be valuable assets because of the increased number of hunters wanting to pursue them, they are seldom thought of as being harmful. Why don't I have any javelina on my land? I did four years ago. Brush clearing has decreased javelina range in Texas more than any other factor. Heavy hunting pressure could  also cause javelina to disappear, but only in a few areas are javelina vulnerable to extensive hunting. As long as food, cover and protection from overhunting are provided, javelina should remain in the area. Do I need brood stock trapped and put onto my land, or will javelina find my ranch? If you do not have javelina on your ranch now, there is little likelihood of the animals showing up someday. In South Texas javelina seldom move over one mile. Mov ements greater than this are made only by solitary boars. Before asking the Parks and Wildlife Department for brood stock, you should first determine if your ranch has suitable javelina habitat. The wildlife biologist in your area will be glad to assist you in this evaluation. And too, there must be enough land, about 5,000 acres, pledged to the protection of this brood stock for the department to consider re stocking javelina on the area. Since there is often a difference of opinion on the merits of javelina, a public hearing is always held to insure public acceptance of javelina prior to release. Are javelina really dangerous? The javelina, although weighing only about 55 pounds, does have the capability of committing aggravated assault on a human being. Its canine teeth are very well developed for cutting and slashing. However, the javelina is not aggressive and will almost always retreat from a person unless cornered. Most stories of charging javeli n a stem from the habit of javelina, which are extremely nearsighted, scattering in all directions when an alarm is sounded by one of the herd. With 20 javelina going in all directions, at least one is bound to be headed for the intruder, and even the bravest of souls is certain the beast is out to do him bodily harm. The herd will then mill around for a time making ""whoof whoof' sounds and occasionally popping their teeth, which is not unlike the sound made by hitting two large bones together at the rate of four times a second. They will stay in the area until the cause of the alarm is found, often making the intruder, who sought safety aloft, feel ""treed."" The javelina can be dangerous when hunted with dogs. Probably due to its hatred of the coyote which preys on its young, javelina are very aggressive around any dog, as many quail hunters in the brush country can testify. The two-inch canines of the javelina have caused many a hound man to cut short his hunt for a trip to the veterinarian to have his dog sewed up. And, in the case of the javelina hunter, it is not rare for stitches to be required in his hide, for when cornered the javelina makes no distinction between dogs and hunters. **  TEXAS PARKS & WILDLIFE MAGAZINE.. .

GX057-24-8904428	"I-G 98-30     Refer:        Rich Howard, Boise, Idaho - 208/378-5243     Susan Saul, Portland, Oregon - 503/231-6121      March 23, 1998     NORTHERN IDAHO GROUND SQUIRREL PROPOSED FOR PROTECTION AS THREATENED SPECIES          The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service today announced a proposal to list the northern Idaho ground squirrel, a species already protected by the State of Idaho, as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. Federal protection would bolster protections already given to the species by Idaho.     This rare squirrel has the most restricted geographical range of any squirrel and one of the smallest ranges among all North American mainland mammals. The northern Idaho ground squirrel is found only in Idaho and occurs on public and private lands northwest of Council, Idaho. Its entire range is about 18 by 20 miles, although historically, its range may have been much larger, extending southeast to Round Valley near Cascade, Idaho.     As recently as 1985, about 5,000 individuals were counted in Adams and Valley counties. By 1997, fewer than 1,000 individuals were found in 21 colonies, primarily on privately-owned lands and lands administered by the Payette National Forest. Colony sizes range from 3 to 40 acres.     The northern Idaho ground squirrel occurs in shallow, dry, rocky meadows usually associated with deeper, well-drained soils and surrounded by ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir forests at elevations of about 3,800 to 5,200 feet. It eats mainly grass seeds and stems, and herbs. It needs large quantities of these foods to store body energy for the long period it spends in torpor underground from August through late March of each year.     Another subspecies, the Columbian ground squirrel, lives in the same habitat as the northern Idaho ground squirrel and competes for the same food and space. It is about one-third larger than the northern Idaho ground squirrel.     Habitat loss due to forest encroachment into meadows is the main threat to the northern Idaho ground squirrel. Forest expansion into natural meadows is a result of fire suppression.     Other threats include agricultural conversion, residential development of the squirrel's habitat, and recreational shooting of squirrels in colonies adjacent to towns and farms.     The State of Idaho recognizes the northern Idaho ground squirrel as a ""species of special concern,"" which protects it from taking and possession.     The Fish and Wildlife Service has been working with Federal, state and private landowners to reduce threats and undertake recovery actions that may reverse the steep decline of this species. The Payette National Forest signed a conservation agreement with the Service in 1996 to protect and enhance habitat for the northern Idaho ground squirrel. The Forest Service is making habitat improvements for the squirrel, including thinning stands of timber to open more meadow habitat to squirrel recolonization, and conducting controlled burning of shrubby meadows to create additional grassland and herbs. For example, 3.3 million board feet of timber is proposed for harvest in the Lick Creek drainage in 1998.     The conservation agreement also sets the stage for translocation of animals from strong colonies to weak or recently wiped out colonies. Annual evaluations of the habitat modifications and conservation actions during the next 5 years will document the success and corrections needed for this strategy. One private landowner also previously developed a management agreement with The Nature Conservancy to help protect one of the largest remaining colonies.     An experimental transplant plan, developed by scientists from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and Albertson College in Caldwell, Idaho began in 1997. Forty-nine squirrels were transplanted to two sites, but results will not be known until monitoring is completed this spring.     The Service will hold a public hearing on the proposed listing in Council, Idaho on May 5 from 6-8 p.m. at the Council Elementary School, 202 Highway 95. Public comments on this proposal are invited until May 22, 1998. Comments should be sent to the Supervisor, Snake River Basin Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1387 South Vinnell Way, Room 368, Boise, Idaho 83709.     The proposal to list the northern Idaho ground squirrel as threatened was published in the  Federal Register  on March 23, 1998.     x x x         Note to Editors:  Photographs of the northern Idaho ground squirrel are available by contacting Rich Howard at (208) 378-5243."

Purpose and Need 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this draft environmental assessment is to determine the actions that may be taken by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine the future of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam.  1.2 The Environmental Assessment Process This document is the final Environmental Assessment (EA) for a project that involves the removal of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam on the Baraboo River, in the Town of Greenfield, in Sauk County. The project is partially funded by the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program (Wildlife Conservation Restoration Subprogram) that is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Natural Resources. Because of the funding source, the project must comply with both the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act (WEPA) including Chapter NR 150, of the Wisconsin Administrative Code. This EA has been prepared to meet both Federal and State laws that require full public disclosure of projects that may affect the quality of the human environment. The purpose of an EA is to disclose, explain, and evaluate the environmental effects of a proposed government action to the decision-makers and the public. The EA describes and evaluates alternatives to the proposed course of action. The Draft EA is circulated for public review and comment to assure public participation in the process. A public informational meeting was held during the public review period to provide an opportunity for the public to obtain information about and to comment on the project. The public review period also gave interested and/or affected persons a chance to review and discuss the project, alternatives, and potential impacts. This final EA incorporates recognition of public concerns and addresses those that are within the scope of the EA and purpose for its development.  1.3 Need Under authority of Chapter 31, of Wisconsin Statutes and NR 333 of Wisconsin Administrative Code, the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam was inspected by the Department of Natural Resources and it was determined that the dam would need substantial repairs or a complete reconstruction to bring it into compliance with this statute and code. According to the report from their regularly scheduled inspection, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Dam Safety Engineer cited undermining and deterioration of the concrete spillw ay, as main reasons why the dam is unsafe. Any actions taken to address this situation would have to address the overall structural integrity of the dam, fish passage, concerns over impacts to historic properties, and be economically feasible. Therefore this project is directed toward meeting several needs: safety problems associated with the current dam (abandonment or repair), fish migration on the Baraboo River, and aquatic habitat improvement.  1   1.4 Decisions That Need to Made Upon completion of the public review the Regional Director (Region 3, USFWS) will make a decision on the alternative selected and whether or not a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be determined.  1.5 Background The Baraboo River flows approximately 120 miles from its headwaters near Hillsboro to its confluence with the Wisconsin River south of Portage. Its watershed encompasses 650 square miles, or about 415,000 acres and drops over 150 feet in elevation. This concentration of relatively steep gradient was recognized by early white settlers for its potential to generate mechanical power and in 1837 settlers began constructing dams on the Baraboo River. The dams that were built on the Baraboo River system date to the water power era, which began in the 1840s and 1850s. These dams were authorized under the Milldam Act, which dates to early statehood. This Act encouraged the development of dams for waterpower for logging and milling purposes. Before dams were constructed on the Baraboo River, the river had healthy fish populations with seasonal spawning runs of lake sturgeon, walleye, sauger, bigmouth buffalo, freshwater drum and other species. Riffle habitats, where many of the dams were built, provided critical spawning sites for these fish. The impoundments' slow current and deep pools allowed sediment from the watershed's developing agricultural lands to settle on the river bottom, covering once-productive aquatic habitat for invertebrates and the fish they support. Dams on the Baraboo River system are pe rhaps the major limiting factor to achieving healthy fish populations for those migratory species including fish populations of the Wisconsin River. Mussel populations have also suffered because of impediment to fish movement. Fish serve as hosts for mus sel larvae and are a major influence on their distribution in a river system. There were four major dams on the Baraboo River and three of them have been removed (Waterworks, LaValle and Oak Street--see below). In August 2001, the DNR purchased the dam. The previous owner of the dam had applied to abandon the dam. The dam is currently in bad repair and would require expensive repairs to bring it into compliance with state and federal dam safety codes and statutes. If the proposed alternative is selected, the dam will be will be removed with federal financial assistance.  2   Regional Map of the Baraboo River and Project Area  LaValle  Former Lavalle Dam Glenville Dam Former Oak St. Dam Former Waterworks Dam  3   Site of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam  Baraboo Site of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam  Baraboo River  Babbling Brook  4   1.5.1 Removal of the Waterworks Dam (removed in 1997) The Waterworks Dam, a municipal dam owned by the City of Baraboo was removed in 1997. The original dam was constructed circa 1860 under the Milldam Act. The dam was located near the city limits in southeast portion of the city and downstream from the Circus World Museum (see regional map). After numerous public meetings and successful negotiations between the City, WDNR, State Historical Society and the Circus World Museum, a decision was finally made to remove the Waterworks dam, on the condition that certain steps to mitigate the loss of the historic appearance the impounded river provided. In December 1997 breaching of the dam began, with final removal occurring in April 1998. By removing the Waterworks Dam, the City of Baraboo has permanently eliminated a major current and future liability, for less than one -third the cost of repairing the structure. The City was paying $5,000 annually in liability insurance for the dam and its associated structures. Positive changes in the ha bitat were immediately evident and additional monitoring is expected to show increased fishery benefits. Three-quarters of a mile of high-quality riffle habitat, rare in southern Wisconsin rivers, has been restored to its free-flowing condition following removal of the Waterworks Dam.  1.5.2 Removal of the Oak Street Dam (removed in 2000) A Corps of Engineers inspection report (1980) states that the former Oak Street dam was originally constructed in 1885 of timber and rock and was used to generate power for a flour mill and for a towel mill factory beginning in 1910. The McArthur family owned the former dam since 1898 and also owns the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam on the Baraboo River located approximately 1.5 miles downstream of the Oak Street Dam (see regional map). The dam had an impoundment of 64 - 195 acre-feet, surface area of 16 - 38 acres and a length of 0.8 miles. A steep river gradient is present at the dam site, and water will move through the area at a velocity higher than most areas along the river. During initial monitoring of this site before the dam was removed, coal tar deposits were discovered in the bed of the river. Alliant Energy removed the deposits at a cost of over $600,000. In addition to the removal of the dam and the work done on the powerhouse, bank stabilization and habitat enhancement was also accomplished. This should add to the benefits to the aquatic environment that are achieved by the removal of the dam.  1.5.3 The LaValle Dam (removed in 2001) The Sand County Foundation purchased the dam and mill, located in the Village of LaValle, from the former owner in 1999, for the purpose of removing the dam and restoring the river to a natural state (see regional map). The LaValle Dam was removed in March of 2001. During the pr evious year, staff from the Department, the Sand County Foundation, Sauk County, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service had met with residents of LaValle to reach consensus on a plan for mitigation of the loss of the millpond after the dam removal. Restoration of the lakebed will follow this plan and should be complete by July 2002.  1.5.4 The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam is located at the downstream side and just east of the City of Baraboo, 45 miles northeast of Madison in Section 6, T11N, R7E. The dam was originally constructed in 1898 and has been modified, rebuilt, and rehabilitated several times since it was originally constructed. The length of the maximum pool upstream of the dam is approximately 1.5 miles and the size of the pool is 7 acres. The dam consists of a small powerhouse, a large uncontrolled spillway and a small auxiliary spillway. The original use of the dam was to provide power for a linen  5   mill. It presently is used to produce a small amount of electrical power. The structural portions of the facility consist of timber, concrete, masonry, rock and gravel fill, and earth. After inspection by the Department, the dam was found to have problems with its structural integrity and is not in compliance with Chapter 31, of Wisconsin Statutes and NR 333 of Wisconsin Administrative Code. As with the other dams, the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam needs substantial repairs or a complete reconstruction to bring it into compliance with this statute and code. This dam is the last remaining blockage to fish migration, being the lowermost dam. If this blockage to fish migration, is removed, then fish can access the entire Baraboo River. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource purchased the dam in August 2001. The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam  2. Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action 2.1 Alternative Not Considered for Detailed Analysis Besides the alternatives listed below, another alternative was considered for detailed analysis. The option of letting the structure remain in place and simply modifying the spillway to enable the river to flow freely through the structure was considered. This was rejected because the decaying dam structure would still be in place and would still need major repairs to bring the structure into compliance with statutes and codes and would still represent a significant financial burden for the owner. Leaving the spillway in place and allowing the water to flow through would represent a serious safety problem.  2.2 Alternatives Carried Forward for Detailed Analysis  6   2.2.1 Alternative A (Proposed Action)  Remove Dam and Restore the River Channel The proposed action includes removing the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam and restoring and enhancing habitat in the newly formed river cha nnel. In addition, the previous owner of the dam did not wish to make costly repairs that would bring this dam into compliance with statutes and codes that regulate the safety aspects of this dam. Therefore, from an ecological and financial perspective, removal of the dam and restoration of the river channel is the desired alternative. The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam was constructed in 1898 under the Mill Dam Act of timber, rock, and gravel. In 1912, a new concrete flume and retaining wall was constructed. In 1928, additional repairs were made and a new powerhouse was installed. It still produces a relatively small amount of electrical power (100 KW capacity generator). The current structure consists of a 86 long fixed crest spillway with buttress supports and a small concrete chute auxiliary spillway. If this alternative is chosen, the actions below will occur: The dam spillway will be breached in a manner so that sediment moving downstream from the impounded area is minimized. The sediments in the impounded area have been sampled for laboratory analysis. If contamination is present, the affected area will be isolated and the material will be removed in compliance with the environmental remediation standards of NR 700, of Wisconsin Administrative Code. Trees and brush will be cleared and a temporary gravel road constructed to access the right side (right and left is referred looking downstream) of the dam. The dam fixed crest spillway will be first breached at the right side next to the auxiliary spillway. The initial breach will be accomplished in a manner so that sediment moving downstream from the impounded area is minimized. After the water level of the impoundment is lowered, the demolition of the fixed crest spillway will be approached from the left side next to the powerhouse. The rock fill of the timber structure on the upstream side of the support concrete wall will be rearranged to form a pad for the backhoe to easily traverse across the river along the upstream side of the spillway. A concrete wall will be constructed at the downstream side of the powerhouse to block the opening of the turbine pit exit. Part of the rock fill materials will then be placed against the foundation walls and pillars of the powerhouse to buttress the founda tion against erosion and undermining. From there, demolition will proceed to the right, forming the final river channel configuration as materials are removed and/or used in channel stabilization. The clean, sandy deposits located immediately upstream of the spillway will be evaluated for removal and if removed, they will be incorporated into the bank structure and other aspects of the site restoration. A small tributary stream referred to as ""Babbling Brook"" enters the river immediately upstream of the spillway. The entry point (Babbling Brook) will be evaluated and the tributary may be aligned slightly to allow high flows to merge with the river without bank erosion, scour, and/or adverse impacts to habitat. Excess material will be trucked off site for disposal at an approved landfill (approved under NR 500, of Wisconsin Administrative Code). The area in front of the powerhouse (upstream) and the downstream side of the powerhouse will be filled in with suitable soil materials (meets engineering standards and specifications). Riprap will be placed along the  7   newly formed and disturbed riverbanks for stabilization. The temporary access road will be removed and all disturbed areas topsoiled and seeded for erosion control and a natural appearance. The spillway removal will require modifications to the outfall structure for the City of Baraboo Wastewater Treatment Plant. The existing outfall elevation is set for the current water level in the millpond. When the water level decreases as a result of the elimination of the impounded area below the dam (if the dam is removed), earthwork, including grading and riprap placement, will be required to assure that the discharge from the plant will flow into the river efficiently without erosion or scour. The City of Baraboo will be coordinating the work with the Department of Natural Resources. Information about the outfall area has been submitted to relevant tribal organizations for review of cultural and sacred sites. If ground disturbance is needed then a revie w for impact on historic properties by the SHPO will be conducted in compliance with federal regulations. This outfall site has also been screened for impact to endangered and threatened species. Documentation will be provided to the Fish and Wildlife Se rvice as needed. Given the nature of the site, it is highly unlikely explosives will be used to remove concrete below the bed of the river. If they are used, they will be used by licensed operators in cooperation with the Town of Greenfield to ensure tha t the timing of their use is compatible with residents and businesses. These activities will be conducted in accordance with DNR manual code (9187.6) and Wisconsin Administrative Code (NR 231). The powerhouse and mill building will remain intact. Borrow sites will be screened for endangered and threatened species and historic properties. Prior to any site disturbance, compliance documents will be obtained by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and provided to the Fish and Wildlife Service as needed. This work will be conducted in cooperation with the Wisconsin State Department of Transportation. They have requested that appropriate spoil material (riprap) be used to protect the State Highway 113 bridge, located immediately downstream of the dam structure (within the project area). This work or any work that pertains to State Highway 113, would have their approval before proceeding. 2.2.1.1 Significance of Risk/Unknowns (This section required by WEPA) There are no significant unknowns associated with this project. The results of dam removals are highly predictable. Pre-dam hydrology and stream morphology is restored. Hundreds of dams have been removed in the State of Wisconsin within the regulatory guidelines in Chapter 31 of the Wiscons in Statutes 2.2.1.2 Significance of Precedent (This section required by WEPA) This action is not precedent setting. The benefits to habitat and water quality from dam removal are well documented in the scientific literature. Removal of this dam will demonstrate there are alternatives to repair and maintenance of aging dam structures. Removal of this dam will improve aquatic habitat and protect public rights in navigable waters. 2.2.1.3 Land Ownership Issues A land use agreement with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation may be needed to do work within the highway right of way, where it crosses the river.  8   2.2.1.4 Authorities and Approvals (list local, state and federal permits or approvals required) Army Corps of Engineers GP/LOP - General Permit/Letter of Permission required for dam removal and stream stabilization Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources  Permit issuance under Section 31.185, of Wisconsin Statutes to transfer ownership of the dam to DNR contingent on removal. Manual Code Approval plans and specifications for removal and site restoration under Section 31.12, of Wisconsin Statutes, Public Information Meeting-(Opportunity for Hearing) under Section 31.253, Wisconsin Statutes, WEPA Compliance (Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act  NR 150, Wisconsin Administrative Code) Town of Greenfield and Sauk County - Revise and amend the shoreland wetland and flood plain zoning maps and ordinances as necessary. The Department will conduct the analysis pertaining to these changes. Sauk County and the Town of Greenfield will incorporate these changes into their flood plain ordinance through the amendment process. No measurable changes in the flood profile are expected to occur. Wisconsin Department of Transportation  Approval required to work on state owned right of way, easement and property United States Fish and Wildlife Service (Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act)  Selection of alternatives and FONSI determination National Environmental Policy Act Compliance with the Endangered Species Act Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act  2.2.2 Alternative B  (No Action) The ""no action"" alternative includes keeping the dam and millpond in place as is. An inspection of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam noted several structural deficiencies and severe deterioration of the structural integrity of the dam. For this reason, a schedule for completing rehabilitation of the dam to meet Wisconsin State Dam Safety standards was not imposed on the dam owner. The cos t to rehabilitate or rebuild the dam was estimated to be at a minimum $200,000. This is based on other dam construction projects and included engineering and contingencies. These projects include the dam removal and reconstruction projects in the Wiscons in villages and cities of Evansville, Baraboo (Waterworks and Oak Street), Cazenovia, and Afton. These dams are similar in the size and type of construction (i.e. structural height of 6-10 feet and impounded area) to the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam. Moreover, these dams were built during the period when many mill dams were constructed (1840-1900) in Wisconsin and all have similar structural problems associated with aging. Repairs to correct the problems with these aging structures are usually not cost effective; communities have found it to be more economical to remove the dam or completely rebuild it. Approval of plans according to Section 31.12, of Wisconsin Statutes for the removal and abandonment of the dam is pending. State approval of the application from the present owner of the dam cannot be denied if all of the conditions imposed as part of the plan approval are met. These primary conditions include insuring that the plan for abandonment includes constructing a stabilized river channel, followin g erosion control measures, and properly disposing of demolition material. If the dam is not abandoned and removed, it must be rehabilitated. In addition, it will be necessary to reconstruct the north end of the spillway to structurally separate the forebay of the powerhouse and the powerhouse/mill building, which is now under separate ownership, from the dam. This will be necessary to maintain the non-dam status of these structures.  9   Pursuing the ""no action"" alternative would result with an expense that would not be eligible for federal assistance, retain the blockage to fish migration and result with no benefit to the aquatic resources of the Baraboo River. The negative environmental impact of the dam will remain in perpetuity, because the dam will need to be rehabilitated to meet state dam safety standards. The impounded area which has poor water quality and large amounts of silt (average depth of 3 feet), would continue to have poor water quality into the future, would provide a limited fishery for sport fish and serve as a carp ""nursery"" for the rest of the river  2.2.3 Alternative C  Repair the Dam and Install Fish Passage This alternative will require retaining the dam as described in the ""no action"" alternative. In order to negate some of the negative impacts of maintaining the dam, a fish passage could be constructed to allow movement of fish through the dam structure under normal to low flood conditions . Under flood conditions, the dam becomes inundated and some degree of fish movement occurs. However, this inundation of the dam is highly unpredictable and may not coincide with annual fish spawning migrations. Thus, the dam still is a major impediment to fish migration. Construction of a fish passage would be a major structural underta king and would require almost complete reconstruction of the dam. The physical site conditions for constructing a fish passage are very restrictive. A state highway and bridge is located approximately 100 feet downstream of the dam. The property adjacent to the north side of the dam is under private ownership with commercial buildings. Immediately downstream of the dam is a large deep ""fishing hole"" and is heavily used by local anglers. Due to the physical size and configuration of a warm water fish passage, it would have a major impact on the highway bridge and the downstream ""fishing hole"". Because of the location of the highway and associated bridge immediately downstream there are major physical constraints to the installation of fish passage that would add great costs to its construction. The actual fish passage channel may have to be incorporated into the highway embankment and/or the bridge structure itself would have to be modified. Based on cost estimates for construction of fish passage structures for other dams (such as the dam at Brodhead, Wisconsin on the Sugar River which ranged from $250,000 to $500,000) and rivers of similar size, the cost of a fish passage at this site would be approximately $250,000. This would be in addition to costs associated with dam reconstruction, which would be more costly than rehabilitation as described in the ""no action"" alternative.  10   Table 1: Comparison of Alternatives Alternative Number 2.

Affected Environment 3.1 Physical Environment With a gradient of 1.59 feet per mile (see Appendix), the Baraboo River drops over 150 feet in elevation from its source to its mouth. Prior to building dams on the Baraboo River, rocky riverbed with riffle -pool-run habitat, and fastmoving reaches were more common. Riparian corridor along the Baraboo River is the dominant natural feature within the project area. Islands are located in the river channel above the dam. The river banks are approximately four feet high (impounded conditions) along much of the river channel within the project boundary. The riv er channel in the project area (see map) is approximately 3-5 feet deep and has a substrate of sand and rubble. The bottom substrate of the riverbed consists of fine silty material that overlays medium to coarse-grained sands with areas of gravel, cobble, and possibly boulders in some areas. The impounded area above the dam is approximately 7 acres in size and the average depth is 1-4 feet. It is surrounded by a variety of wetland vegetation. Soundings indicate that the bed in the millpond is made up of sand, and characteristic sediment of the Baraboo River floodplain in the area.  11   Soils in the floodplain riparian corridor are level, poorly drained fluvaquents. Most of the areas are long and narrow with a wide range of soil characteristics. Surface layers range from a silt loam to sand and organic. Hydric units including Adrian, Houghton, Marshan, and Palms are found within this mapping series. Permeability of the fluvaquent unit is moderate to high, but frequent flooding and a higher water table keep the soils wet. The dam spillway core is a rock filled timber crib structure with timber gates originally built in 1898. The length of the maximum pool upstream of the dam is approximately 1.5 miles and the size of the pool is 7 acres. Eventually the timber control gates were replaced with concrete and the timber crib spillway was capped over the concrete. The fixed crest spillway is 86 feet long.  3.2 Biological Environment 3.2.1 Habitat/Vegetation The Baraboo River originates near Hillsboro in Vernon County, Wisconsin, and flows southeasterly through central Wisconsin before joining the Wisconsin River just downstream (south) in Columbia County, Wisconsin (see Figures B in the Appendix). The headwaters of the Baraboo River begin in the ""Driftle ss Area"" and join the Wisconsin River in the ""Central Plain"" region near Portage. Glacial drift consisting of sand and gravel is abundant in the area, with alluvial sand and gravel filling the Baraboo Valley. Land use along the river system is dominated by agriculture. Agricultural fields extend throughout the watershed and end at the river corridor, where a narrow forested line abuts the riverbank. Beginning at Reedsburg, Wisconsin, and extending upstream along the Baraboo River and most tributaries is a narrow shrub and timber swamp wetland corridor. The Baraboo River Corridor has many types of relict plant and forest communities listed along tributaries, such as the Floodplain Forest and Wet-Mesic Prairie, in addition to Pine and Hemlock Relicts.  3.2.2 Threatened, Endangered and Candidate Species There are no federally threatened, endangered or candidate species present in the project area. The Natural Heritage Inventory (NHI) lists four state listed fish species and as present in the Wisconsin River dow nstream from the dam site and one state species that was recorded as being present in the Baraboo River several miles downstream. There is a historical record for the winged mapleleaf, Quadrula fragosa, a mussel listed as endangered both in Wisconsin and at the federal level. It is extremely unlikely this species still exists in the Baraboo or Wisconsin Rivers. These fish species are as follows:      Cycleptus elongatus (blue sucker) State Etheostoma clarum (western sand darter) State Macrhybopsis storeria na (silver chub) State Macrhybopis aestivalis (speckled chub) State Ictiobus niger (black buffalo) State  12   It is highly unlikely these fish species are present at the dam site but it is possible that they will migrate (at specific times of the year) into pr oject area following dam removal and as habitat conditions change. The NHI also lists numerous plant species in the Baraboo Hills at Devils Lake State Park and in the general vicinity of the project site. Borrow sites outside of the project area will be reviewed for threatened and endangered species as these sites are identified.  3.2.3 Other Wildlife Species The dominant sport fishery of the Baraboo River in the vicinity of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam includes northern pike, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish. Panfish are common, and rough and forage fish are abundant. Upstream areas in the Baraboo River are not fully populated by all of the species present in the system. A survey by Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources fisheries staff found that 10 species were present below the lower dam in Baraboo that were not found above. Fish populations below the dams were more typical of healthy riverine communities (darters, redhorse, etc.) while the impounded sections contained high populations of carp. The dams prevent the Baraboo River from serving as a nursery area for the Wisconsin River fishery. Common wildlife (mammal) species in the vicinity of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam include muskrat, mink, muskrat, gray and fox squirrel, chipmunk, coyote, and occasionally river otter. Common bird species include Catbird, House Wren, Kingfisher, Great Blue Heron, Red-winged Blackbird, flycatchers, Wood Ducks and wrens. The dominant vegetation communities/habitat types present in the project area are floodplain forest, marsh, and fresh wet meadow. Dominant Species types among the vegetation communities are as follows: raccoon, Robin, marsh shallow  Floodplain: Tree species include Green Ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Black Ash (Fraxinus negundo), American elm (Ulmus americana L.), Willow spp. (Salix spp.), Cottonwood (Populus deltoides), Oak spp. (Quercus spp.), Box elder (Acer negundo). Shrub types include Willow spp. (Salix spp.), young Green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), buckthorn, wild grape, dogw ood, and sumac. Herbaceous layer inlcude Reed Canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea), grass spp. (Poa spp.), Cattail, Carex lacustris, Carex spp., goldenrods (Solidago spp.).  3.3 Land Use The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam is in the Town of Greenfield and located near the City of Baraboo. The surrounding area is mixed woodland and agricultural (including hobby farms). There are several businesses located in the old mill building.  3.4 Cultural/Paleontological Resources The State Historic Protection Officer (SHPO) has determined that the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam and its associated complex does not have historic significance hence there would be no impact to any historical properties within the project area (see appendix). All actions described within this doc ument are within this project boundary. Borrow sites outside of the project area will be reviewed by SHPO if these sites are needed.  3.5 Local Social/Economic Conditions 13   The 1990 population of Sauk County was 46,975. Baraboo is the largest city in the County with a population of 9,203 (1990). Baraboo and Reedsburg are service centers for the surrounding area. Waterfowl hunting and canoeing are listed as important recreational functions. There are no prime agricultural lands in the immediate vicinit y of the dam.  14   4. Environmental Consequences 4.1 Alternative A (Proposed Action)  Remove the Dam and Restore the River Channel 4.1.1 Fishery Impacts  Cumulative The removal of the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam will take away a barrier to fish migr ation that prevents several species of fish from reaching spawning areas in the upper reaches of the Baraboo River. This system wide impact of removing the three upstream dams will not be fully realized until the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam (the last dam on the entire river) is removed. With no obstructions to movement, native fish populations will reestablish the traditional migratory patterns and regain access to critical habitats. Several fish species such as lake sturgeon, smallmouth bass, walleye, sauger, black buffalo (state threatened) and channel catfish will be able to access the upper reaches of the river and exploit historic spawning habitat. The upstream distribution of a number of fish species on the Baraboo River terminates at or near the Gle nville (Linen Mill) Dam. These species included musky, three redhorse species (silver, golden and shorthead), channel catfish, stonecat, three species rare in the Baraboo (warmouth, blackside darter and slenderhead darter) and walleye. Additionally, 1-4 specimens of three species usually limited to the river below the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam (gizzard shad, spotted sucker and freshwater drum) were collected in small number below the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam following heavy flooding in June 2000. With the removal of the dam, the main stem of the Baraboo River will be free flowing for it's entire length. As to direct and tangible benefits to humans, we will likely see improved fishing, especially for smallmouth bass, sauger, walleye, northern pike, white and yellow bass, and channel and flathead catfish. Fish populations that have been fragmented since the construction of the Glenville (Linen Mill) and other dams will be reconnected. Genetic health of species that had fragmented populations because of the dams blocking fish movement will be improved.  4.1.2 Site Specific Fishery and Habitat Impacts At the dam site proper, the fish habitat will be improved immediately with the placement of rock riprap and restoration of the pre-dam, stream profile. The channel in the vicinity of the former dam will scour and the substrate will tend to become more rocky and thus the habitat will improve. Fish species such as smallmouth bass and walleye will regain access to spawning, feeding and nursery areas that have been unavailable to them since the construction of this dam. Rock-riffle substrates that are covered by silt, as a result of the impoundment, will recover and provide quality habitats to native riverine fishes such as smallmouth bass. Increase in the amount of rock-riffle habitat would benefit macroinvetebrate species diversity and increase mayfly and caddisfly populations. Non-native species, such as carp, and native species that are indicative of poor water quality and degraded habitats, such as black bullhead and green sunfish, will become less common as conditions improve for desirable riverine species. Some areas affected by the dam impoundment will change. The river channel will be narrower upstream. The floodplain downstream of the dam will not be affected. Additional benefits to the fish population should occur through time and a comprehensive study is underway on the effects of the Baraboo River dam removals to document the changes to fishery and aquatic ecosystem. Preliminary findings indicate a positive response in the fish and aquatic insect populations.  15   . Temporary stockpiling of sand for later removal and transport out of the area from the bottom of the impoundment will occur on the south bank and immediately upstream of the current dam structure and will cover an area less than one acre in size. No other appreciable impacts to the adjacent banks are expected to occur.  4.1.3 Impact on Mussel Populations The dam removal will improve conditions for mussel fauna of the Baraboo by exposing them to fish hosts and they will have access to additional stream habitats. Mussel species diversity and population levels should increase. The opportunity for glochidia (larval mussels) to be transported upstream through various species of fish hosts will be greatly enhanced by the dam removal.  4.1.4. Impact on Water Quality Because the existing impounded area upstream from the dam will be eliminated, it will no longer serve as a carp nursery for the system. The impounded area upstream from the dam which is very eutrophic will be replaced by a higher quality flowing river reach. In addition, the impounded area upstream from the dam will no longer contribute water with low dissolved oxygen to the river system.  4.1.5 Safety Removal of the dam would solve the current problem of the present unsafe condition of the dam.  4.1.6 Impact on Flooding Downstream If the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam is removed, the flooding of areas downstream will not increase to any noticeable degree. The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam, is a ""run of the river"" dam and has no significant impact on the volume of water flowing in the river as a whole and does not function as flood control or flood storage structure. The dam becomes submerged at the less than the 10-year storm and the hydraulic analysis included in the appendix indicates that the dam during more frequent and smaller flood events has no measurable effect on flows. During larger events like the 25-year storm the flow reduction, from the dam, is as small as 0.5%, with no storage capacity. As a result, removal of the dam will not have any noticeable effect on the upstream or downstream flow and stage during major floods Data and an analysis to support this assessment is covered in the attached appendix.  4.1.7 Cultural Resources There are no historical properties in the project area. Borrow sites outside of the project area will be reviewed by SHPO once these sites are identified.  4.1.8 Endangered/Threatened Species 16   The state threatened fish species, Ictiobus niger, (black buffalo), which was recorded as being present several miles downstream from the project site, could possibly benefit from the proposed dam removal since it could then ascend the river upstream above the present dam site to spawn. Bor row sites outside of the project area will be reviewed for endangered and threatened species once these sites are identified.  4.2  Alternative B - No Action - Repair the Dam Only  4.2.1 Fishery Impacts  Cumulative This alternative would mean that the dam is repaired. The greatest environmental impact of this alternative is that the dam would continue to serve as a barrier to fish movement and fragment the river ecosystem. Several species of fish, such as walleye, sauger, lake sturgeon, fresh wate r drum and smallmouth bass are limited in their seasonal spawning movements because they cannot access the river above the Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam. Leaving the dam in place would continue to have a negative impact on the fishery of the Baraboo River.  4.2.2 Site Specific Fishery and Habitat Impacts Leaving the dam in place with repairs being made to bring it into compliance with safety standards would not allow for any habitat improvement work to be done. The riffle habitat that would be permanently exposed if the dam is removed would instead remain covered over with deposited sediment in the impounded area. Fish species requiring riffle habitat for spawning and cover would continue to be negatively impacted. Macroinvertebrate populations would continue to have low diversity and favor species that require sediment dominated substrate. The tailwater area would remain below the dam where fish concentrate at the limit of their upstream migration and thereby attracts anglers.  4.2.3 Mussel Populations Mussel species and population would remain the same. Because the fish cannot move upstream above the dam, the mussel population of the upper river would not improve because fish host species cannot freely access the upper river and serve as vectors for population establishment.  4.2.4 Impact on Water Quality As it currently exists, the impounded area upstream from the dam has a negative impact on water quality. The impounded area upstream from the dam impoundment would continue to have poor water qua lity because of its fertility (eutrophication) and because of the higher population of carp. Since the impoundment is very fertile, it could suffer from algae blooms which in turn suppress oxygen levels. Carp keep the sediments stirred up and this furthe r distributes nutrients in the water column and has a negative impact on the river as whole. The impoundment serves as a prime breeding area for carp, which will move into the Baraboo River proper.  4.2.5 Safety  17   According to state safety standards the dam is currently unsafe. Under this alternative, the dam would remain in place and repairs would be made by the current owner to bring the dam into compliance with current safety standards.  4.2.6 Impact on Flooding Downstream The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam, is a ""run of the river"" dam and has no significant impact on the volume of water flowing in the river as a whole and does not function as flood control or flood storage structure. Runoff from a rainfall event is not retained by this dam---the impounde d area behind this dam is maintained at a constant level. Data and an analysis to support this assessment is covered in the attached appendix.  4.2.7 Cultural Resources There are no historical properties in the project area.  4.2.8 Endangered/Threatened Species If the dam were repaired, it would continue to be a barrier to the migration of the Black Buffalo, Ictiobus niger, a fish listed as state threatened species list.  4.2 Alternative C  Repair the Dam and Install Fish Passage 4.3.1 Fishery Impacts  Cumulative Under this alternative, fish passage would be installed at the dam (which would also have to receive major repairs as are described above). It cannot be predicted if fish passage would enable the full range of fish species that currently cannot ascend the river and are blocked by the current dam structure to reach spawning areas above the dam. It could be termed as a partial restoration of the river ecosystem.  4.3.2 Site Specific Fishery and Habitat Impacts Habitat improvement work at the dam site could not be done with the dam structure repaired to meet safety standards. A fish passage structure would facilitate fish movement, but this improvement would only address one of a number of adverse impacts that the structure has on the aquatic environment. The riffle habitat (currently submerged) would not be permanently exposed if the dam remains and, diverse habitats present in free flowing rivers would not be restored at the dam site. Coarse substrate would instead remain covered wit h sediment deposits in the impounded area. Fish species requiring riffle habitat for spawning and cover would continue to be negatively impacted. Macroinvertebrate populations would continue to have low diversity and favor species that require sediment dominated susbtrate. Installation of fish passage at the dam would involve a very minor disturbance of terrestrial habitat. This disturbance would be in the immediate vicinity of the dam site.  18   4.3.3 Mussel Populations Mussel populations would be partially benefited by the installation of fish passage. It is expected that mussel populations would be benefited to the extent that fishes could utilize the fish passage that would be installed. As fish species make their upstream migrations, larval mussels are carried to upstream areas to new habitats.  4.3.4 Impact on Water Quality With the installation of fish passage, including repair of the dam, the impounded area upstream from the dam would remain in place. As it currently exists, the impounded area upstream from the dam has a negative impact on water quality. The impoundment would continue to have poor water quality because of its fertility (eutrophication) and because of the high population of carp. Since the impoundment is very fertile, it may suffer from algae blooms which in turn suppress oxygen levels. Carp keep the sediments stirred up and this further distributes nutrients in the water column and has a negative impact on the river as a whole. The impoundment serves as a prime breeding area for carp, which inhabit other parts of the Baraboo River.  4.3.5 Safety According to state safety standards the dam is currently unsafe. Under this alternative, the dam would remain in place and repairs would be made by the current owner to bring the dam into compliance with current safety standards.  4.3.6 Impact on Flooding Downstream The Glenville (Linen Mill) Dam, is a ""run of the river"" dam and has no significant impact on the volume of water flowing in the river as a whole and does not function as flood control or flood storage structure. The dam does not store water to control flooding ---the impounded area behind this dam is maintained at a constant level. Data and an analysis to support this assessment are covered in the attached appendix.  4.3.7 Cultural Resources There are no historical properties in the project area. Borrow sites outside of the project area will be reviewed by SHPO once these sites are identified.  4.3.8 Endangered/Threatened Species The state threatened fish spe cies, Black Buffalo (Ictiobus niger), which was recorded as being present several miles downstream from the project site, could possibly benefit from the installation of fish passage since it could then ascend the river upstream to spawn. However, riffle habitat, which is valuable for spawning and cover would continue to be negatively impacted since the dam structure would still be in place. Borrow sites outside of the project area will be reviewed for endangered and threatened species once these sites are identified.  19   Table 2: Comparison of Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives Alternative A. Proposed Alternative Remove Dam and Restore Channel Will restore spawning runs of several species, defragment aquatic ecosystem Will improve riffle habitat for Smallmouth Bass and several other fish species Will provide mussel species access to host fish species, should improve diversity and numbers of mussels Should improve because carp are removed from impounded area upstream from the dam; the eutrophic impounded area upstream from the dam will be replaced by a flowing river segment No longer an issue No impact No impacts Positive impact to the Black Buffalo, Ictiobus niger, a fish listed as state -threatened, because it could then migrate upstream to spawn.

However, riffle habitat, which is valuable for spawning and cover would continue to be negatively impacted since the dam structure would still be in place.  20   4.4 Environmental Justice None of the alternatives will ha ve a negative impact on the human environment. None of the alternatives will have a negative impact on a minority population or ethnic group. None of the alternatives will negatively impact the economically disadvantaged.  5.

Public Comment on Draft EA/EIS and Response The following table is a summary of the comments received during the comment period and the response by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. None of the issues identified would warrant a change in the Department of Natural Resources proposal to remove the dam.  Commentor Area Maintenance Supervisor, Wisconsin De partment of Transportation  Issues Has no problem with the removal of the Glenville Dam. Recommends that 70 cubic yards of heavy rip -rap be placed on the upstream bridge abutment immediately downstream of the dam site. Wants dam removed Concerned about how the removal would impact flooding on the Baraboo River downstream.  Agency Response This riprapping is described in the EA and will be done in conjunction with the removal proposed dam removal project.  Private Citizen State Representative, Wisconsin Legislature  Private Citizen  Supports removal of the dam. Would like a historical marker placed on the river to commemorate the historical importance of dams to the Baraboo Area  This is the proposed action Since this is a ""run of the river"" dam and the area impounded by the dam has very little storage capacity. The dam as it exists now does not affect flooding downstream to any significant degree. This is addressed in the EA. This is the proposed action DNR, as part of its municipal dam grant fund (for the removal of the Waterwo rks Dam) will cost share 50% of the cost of a historical marker pertaining to all of the former dams on the Baraboo River. WDNR supports this activity. However, recognizing the historical significance of the dam is beyond the scope of this particular proje ct. The plan is to remove the spillway, complete restoration activity, and determine what work is necessary at this location after one year. This is described in the EA.  Private Citizen  Asked about what work will be done on the small tributary that joins the Baraboo River immediately upstream of the dam site.  23   Commentor Citizens for Waterfront Revival, Baraboo, WI, 53913  Issues The group supports removal of the dam. Will sediment be removed from the millpond?  Agency Response This is the proposed action  Removal will be limited to an area immediately upstream of the spillway as described in the EA. Not at this time, material will be worked into the banks as fill as described in the EA. No, that is beyond the scope of this project.  Is there a quantity calculated for the above amount of sediment? Are there plans for watershed improvement for the tributary that joins the river immediately upstream of the dam site? Will the sewer outfall be modified for the post dam river stage? Will the bridge abutments from the old truss bridge downstream of the spillway be preserved? Concerned about historical significance of the dams.  Yes, described in the EA.  Yes, assuming they will not interfere with navigation, bank stability, or habitat work.  Private Citizen  Would like powerhouse removed  DNR, as part of its municipal dam grant fund (for the removal of the Waterworks Dam) will cost share 50% of the cost of a historical marker pertaining to all of the former dams on the Baraboo River. However, recognizing the historical significance of the Glenville Dam is beyond the scope of this project. The powerhouse is still in private ownership and is not part of the proposed project. Sheetpiling, piers, and sediment will be handled in a way that reduces to the extent possible the navigation hazard and also improves the habitat at the immediate dam site. The WDNR took ownership of the dam to enable them to remove the structure.  He also asked questions about sheet piling and piers, sediment, springs, and why the state purchased the dam.  24   25"

LITERATURE CITED ...................................................... 14  i   1. ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT 1.1 Background  On June 13, 2001, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) received a letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) requesting formal consultation regarding the potential effects of the McGilvra Dam Removal Project (COE Permit Number 2001-00540) on Milton Creek on Lower Columbia River (LCR) steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their designated critical habitat. The applicant is Mrs. L.A. McGilvra. The letter described the proposed action, and concluded that the action is ""likely to adversely affect"" (LAA) LCR steelhead or their designated critical habitat. The COE also requested formal consultation on coho salmon (O. kisutch), a candidate species, which is also be present in Milton Creek. Milton Creek is a tributary to the Columbia River near the City of St. Helens, Oregon. The project is at creek mile 4.25 on Milton Creek in Section 31 of T5N, R1E. The LCR steelhead was listed as threatened under the ESA by NMFS on March 19,1998 (63 FR 13347). Lower Columbia River/Southwest Washington (LCRSW) coho salmon is currently a candidate for listing under the ESA (60 FR 38011; July 25, 1995). Since NMFS does not consult on candidate species, LCRSW coho salmon will not be further addressed under the ESA portion of this Opinion. Coho salmon are addressed in the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) section of this Opinion below. The NMFS designated critical habitat for LCR steelhead on February 16, 2000 (65 FR 7764) and issued protective regulations under section 4(d) of the ESA on July 10, 2000 (65 FR 42422). The proposed action is within designated critical habitat for LCR steelhead. The objective of this Opinion is to determine whether the subject action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of LCR steelhead or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat. 1.2 Proposed Action  The proposed action is to authorize the removal of the remnants of McGilvra Dam (a small concrete/rock dam) located at stream mile 4.25 on Milton Creek under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The 5-foot high concrete/rock dam has been previously breeched in the center. The dam, in its existing condition, is a partial barrier to fish migration at certain flows1. The stream substrate around the dam is bedrock. The remaining sections to be removed are 22 feet x 5 feet x 1 foot and 16 feet x 5 feet x 1 foot (approximately 9.5 cubic yards of material). Dam sections to be removed would be isolated from flowing water by constructing sandbag cofferdams around them. Removal would be accomplished using a backhoe or trackhoe. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) fishery biologists would remove (by seining or dip netting) any fish inside the area surrounded by the cofferdams and release them back to the stream. In-water work would be completed during a 2-day period within the ODFW preferred work window of July 15  1  Telephone conversation with Dick Caldwell, ODFW, June 27, 2001 (Discussing McGilvra Dam)  1   to August 31. The excavated material would be removed to an upland landfill, upland quarry, or concrete recycling facility. All streambank areas disturbed by activities associated with this project will be seeded with native grasses and planted with willows and/or red-osier dogwood. 1.3 Biological Information and Critical Habitat  The listing status and biological information for LCR steelhead are described in Busby et al. (1996) and NMFS (1997). The NMFS designated critical habitat for LCR steelhead on February 16, 2000 (65 FR 7764) and applied protective regulations under section 4(d) of the ESA on July 10, 2000 (65 FR 42422). The adjacent riparian zone is included in this critical habitat designation. Critical habitat for LCR steelhead in Oregon includes the mainstem Columbia River and tributaries from its mouth upstream to and including Hood River on the Oregon side of the Columbia River. Freshwater critical habitat includes all waterways, substrates, and adjacent riparian areas--areas beside a stream that provides the following functions: Shade, sediment, nutrient or chemical regulation, streambank stability, and input of large woody debris or organic matter--below longstanding, natural impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years) and several dams that block access to historic LCR steelhead habitat. The proposed action in Milton Creek will occur within designated critical habitat for LCR steelhead. Milton Creek provides spawning, rearing, and migratory habitat for both adult and juvenile life stages of LCR steelhead. Juvenile LCR steelhead are expected to be rearing in the project area during completion of the project. Essential features of the adult spawning, juvenile rearing, and adult and juvenile migratory habitats for the species are: 1) Substrate; 2) water quality; 3) water quantity; 4) water temperature; 5) water velocity; 6) cover/shelter; 7) food (juvenile only); 8) riparian vegetation; 9) space; and 10) safe passage conditions (50 CFR 226.212). The essential features that the proposed project may affect are safe passage conditions, substrate, water quality, and riparian vegetation resulting from project activities. 1.4 Evaluating Proposed Actions  The standards for determining jeopardy are set forth in section 7(a)(2) of the ESA as defined by 50 CFR Part 402 (the consultation regulations). NMFS must determine whether the action is likely to jeopardize the listed species and/or whether the action is likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This analysis involves the: 1) Definition of the biological requirements and current status of the listed species; and 2) evaluation of the relevance of the environmental baseline to the species' current status. Subsequently, NMFS evaluates whether the action is likely to jeopardize the listed species by determining if the species can be expected to survive with an adequate potential for recovery. In making this determination, NMFS must consider the estimated level of mortality attributable to: 1) Collective effects of the proposed or continuing action; 2) the environmental baseline; and 2   3) any cumulative effects. This evaluation must take into account measures for survival and recovery specific to the listed salmonid's life stages that occur beyond the action area. If NMFS finds that the action is likely to jeopardize, NMFS must identify reasonable and prudent alternatives for the action. Furthermore, NMFS evaluates whether the action, directly or indirectly, is likely to destroy or adversely modify the listed species' designated critical habitat. The NMFS must determine whether habitat modifications appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for both survival and recovery of the listed species. The NMFS identifies those effects of the action that impair the function of any essential element of critical habitat. The NMFS then considers whether such impairment appreciably diminishes the habitat's value for the species' survival and recovery. If NMFS concludes that the action will destroy or adversely modify critical habitat it must identify any reasonable and prudent alternatives available. For the proposed action, NMFS' jeopardy analysis considers direct or indirect mortality of fish attributable to the action. NMFS' critical habitat analysis considers the extent to which the proposed action impairs the function of essential biological elements necessary for juvenile and adult migration, spawning, and rearing of the LCR steelhead under the existing environmental baseline. 1.4.1 Biological Requirements  The first step the NMFS uses when applying the ESA section 7(a)(2) to listed steelhead is to define the species' biological requirements that are most relevant to each consultation. The NMFS also considers the current status of the listed species taking into account population size, trends, distribution and genetic diversity. To assess the current status of the listed species, NMFS starts with information considered in its decision to list LCR steelhead for ESA protection then considers new data available that are relevant to the determination. The relevant biological requirements are those necessary for LCR steelhead to survive and recover to naturally reproducing population levels at which protection under the ESA would become unnecessary. Adequate population levels must safeguard the genetic diversity of the listed stock, enhance their capacity to adapt to various environmental conditions, and allow them to become self-sustaining in the natural environment. For this consultation, the biological requirements are improved habitat characteristics that function to support successful adult and juvenile migration, spawning and rearing. LCR steelhead survival in the wild depends upon the proper functioning of certain ecosystem processes, including habitat formation and maintenance. Restoring functional habitats depends largely on allowing natural processes to increase their ecological function, while removing adverse impacts of current practices. In conducting analyses of habitat-altering actions, NMFS defines the biological requirements in terms of a concept called Properly Functioning Condition (PFC) and applies a ""habitat approach"" to its analysis (NMFS 1999). The current status of the  3   LCR steelhead, based upon their risk of extinction, has not significantly improved since the species were listed. 1.4.2 Environmental Baseline  The environmental baseline is an analysis of the effects of past and ongoing human-caused and natural factors leading to the current status of the species or its habitat and ecosystem within the action area. The action area incudes, ""all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action"" (50 CFR 402.02). The action area for this consultation, therefore, includes the streambed and streambank of Milton Creek within the area of disturbance at the project site and downstream to the extent of visible short-term turbidity increases resulting from the project work. The current population status and trends for LCR steelhead are described in Busby et al. (1996) and in NMFS (1997). In general, the current status of LCR steelhead populations is the result of several long-term, human-induced factors (e.g, habitat degradation, water diversions, hydropower dams) that serve to exacerbate the adverse effects of natural environmental variability from such factors as drought, floods, and poor ocean conditions. Most of the Milton Creek watershed is on private land. Much of the drainage upstream from the project is timber land that has been managed for timber production. According to StreamNet, winter steelhead and coho salmon use approximately 16.5 miles of Milton Creek's 19.9 mile length for spawning and rearing. Milton Creek is not listed on the Clean Water Act section 303(d) list. Approximately one mile downstream from the project area, Milton Creek flows through the City of St. Helens, Oregon and enters the Columbia River near the mouth of Scappoose Bay. 1.5 Analysis of Effects 1.5.1 Effects of Proposed Action  The proposed action, as described above in Section 1.2, is to remove the remnants of a small concrete/rock dam at stream mile 4.25 on Milton Creek. The remaining sections of the dam will be isolated from flowing water by sandbag cofferdams before removal. The stream substrate around the area of the dam is bedrock. Therefore, turbidity increases and downstream movement of sediment from the project site are expected to be minimal. Though substrate disturbance is expected to be minimal, some short term turbidity may occur in Milton Creek. The short-term increase in turbidity could result in temporarily reduced feeding efficiency for juvenile salmonids in the project areas and for a short distance downstream. All in-water work will be completed in two days during the ODFW preferred in-water work period for Milton Creek, which is between July 15 and August 31, when listed steelhead are least likely to be present (ODFW 2000). However, since juvenile LCR steelhead rear in Milton Creek year-round, some may be present in the project area even during that time. If fish are present 4   within the areas surrounded by the cofferdams, ODFW fishery biologists will remove them by netting and release them back into Milton Creek. Some direct mortality or injury could result from netting listed LCR steelhead. However, it is expected to be minimal. Removal of the remnants of the concrete/rock dam will improve upstream and downstream passage conditions for both adult and juvenile LCR steelhead in Milton Creek. Based on StreamNet data, approximately 12.3 miles of potential steelhead spawning and rearing habitat are available in Milton Creek upstream from the project site. 1.5.2 Cumulative Effects  ""Cumulative effects"" are defined in 50 CFR 402.02 as those effects of ""future State or private activities, not involving Federal activities, that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the Federal action subject to consultation."" The action area for this consultation includes the streambed and streambank of Milton Creek within the area of disturbance at the project site and downstream to the extent of visible short-term turbidity increases resulting from the project work. NMFS is not aware of any specific future actions which are reasonably certain to occur on non-Federal lands within the Milton Creek watershed. 1.6 Conclusion  NMFS has determined that, when the effects of the removal of the remnants of the small concrete/rock dam addressed in this Opinion are added to the environmental baseline and cumulative effects occurring in the action area, it is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of LCR steelhead. Additionally, NMFS concludes that the subject action would not cause adverse modification or destruction of designated critical habitat for LCR steelhead. NMFS believes that the proposed actions would cause a minor, short-term increase in stream turbidity in Milton Creek. In the long term, survival and safe passage conditions for adult and juvenile LCR steelhead will be improved. Although direct mortality of juvenile LCR steelhead from this project could occur during in-water work, it is not expected, and the level of potential mortality would be minimal and would not result in jeopardy. These conclusions are based on the following considerations: 1) All in-water work will be completed during two days within the ODFW preferred in-water work period between July 15 and August 31; 2) an ODFW fishery biologist will remove or supervise the removal of any fish from the areas to be isolated by cofferdams during in-water work, and release them back into Milton Creek; 3) downstream movement of sediment from the project site will be minimized by using cofferdams to isolate the in-water work area; 4) streambank areas disturbed by project activities will be planted with native grasses and willows and/or red osier dogwood; and 5) NMFS expects that the net effect of the proposed action will be to maintain or help restore properly functioning habitat conditions in the project area of Milton Creek. 1.7 Conservation Recommendations  5   Section 7 (a)(1) of the ESA directs Federal agencies to use their authorities to further the purposes of the ESA by carrying out conservation programs for the benefit of threatened and endangered species. Conservation recommendations are discretionary measures suggested to minimize or avoid adverse effects of a proposed action on listed species, to minimize or avoid adverse modification of critical habitat, or to develop additional information. The NMFS has no additional conservation recommendations regarding the action addressed in this Opinion. 1.8 Reinitiation of Consultation is modified in a way that causes an effect in the BA and this Opinion; 2) new action that may affect the listed species is listed or critical habitat is designated  Reinitiation of consultation is required if: 1) The action on the listed species that was not previously considered information or project monitoring reveals effects of the in a way not previously considered; or 3) a new species that may be affected by the action (50 CFR 402.16).  2. INCIDENTAL TAKE STATEMENT Section 4(d) and Section 9 of the ESA prohibit any taking (harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct) of listed species without a specific permit or exemption. Harm is defined to include significant habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to listed species by significantly impairing behavioral patterns such as breeding, feeding, and sheltering (64 FR 60727; November 8, 1999). Harass is defined as actions that create the likelihood of injuring listed species to such an extent as to significantly alter normal behavior patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, and sheltering. Incidental take is take of listed animal species that results from, but is not the purpose of, the Federal agency or the applicant carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. Under the terms of Section 7(b)(4) and Section 7(o)(2), taking that is incidental to, and not intended as part of, the agency action is not considered prohibited taking provided that such taking is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this incidental take statement. An incidental take statement specifies the impact of any incidental taking of threatened species. If necessary, it also provides reasonable and prudent measures that are necessary to minimize impacts and sets forth terms and conditions with which the action agency must comply in order to implement the reasonable and prudent measures. 2.1 Amount or Extent of the Take  NMFS anticipates that the proposed action has more than a negligible likelihood of resulting in incidental take of LCR steelhead because of detrimental effects from increased sediment and pollutant levels (non-lethal), riparian habitat disturbance (non-lethal), and the capture and release or any juvenile fish necessary to isolate the in-water work area (lethal and non-lethal). Effects of actions such as minor sedimentation and minor riparian disturbance are unquantifiable in the short term and are not expected to be measurable as long-term harm to habitat features or 6   by long-term harm to salmonid behavior or population levels. Therefore, even though NMFS expects some low level incidental take to occur due to the construction actions other than isolating the work area covered by this Opinion, best scientific and commercial data available are not sufficient to enable NMFS to estimate the specific amount of incidental take to the species itself. In instances such as these, NMFS designates the expected level of take as ""unquantifiable."" Based on the information in the biological assessment, NMFS anticipates that an unquantifiable amount of incidental take could occur as a result of the habitat altering actions covered by the Opinion. The extent of the take includes the aquatic and associated riparian habitats affected by removal of McGilvra Dam, upstream to the edge of disturbance, and downstream 300 feet. Unlike general habitat effects, the effects of isolating the work area from the flowing waters of Milton Creek could result in minor incidental lethal take of LCR steelhead that can be quantified based on the results of past salvage operations. NMFS anticipates that an incidental take of up to 20 juvenile LCR steelhead could occur as a result of isolating the work area as described in this Opinion. The extent of take is limited to LCR steelhead in Milton Creek. 2.2 Effect of the Take  In this Opinion, the NMFS has determined that the level of anticipated take is not likely to result in jeopardy to LCR steelhead or to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat when the reasonable and prudent measures are implemented. 2.3 Reasonable and Prudent Measures  The NMFS believes the following reasonable and prudent measures are necessary and appropriate to minimize the likelihood of take of LCR steelhead resulting from the action covered by this Opinion. The COE shall include, as part of the Section 404 permit, measures that will: 1. 2. 3. 2.4 Minimize the likelihood of incidental take resulting from in-water work. Minimize the likelihood of incidental take and impacts on critical habitat resulting from damage to riparian vegetation, streambank erosion, or water pollution. Complete a comprehensive monitoring and reporting program to ensure this Opinion is meeting its objective of minimizing the likelihood of take from permitted activities. Terms and Conditions  To be exempt from the prohibitions of section 9 of the ESA, the COE must require, as part of the Section 404 Permit, and the applicant and/or their contractors must comply with the following terms and conditions, which implement the reasonable and prudent measures described above. These terms and conditions are nondiscretionary. 7   1.  To implement reasonable and prudent measure #1, above, the COE shall ensure that: a. All work within the active channel that could potentially contribute sediment or toxicants to the stream will be completed within the ODFW approved in-water work period for Milton Creek of July 15 to August 312. Extensions of the in-water work period, including those for work outside the wetted perimeter of the stream but below the ordinary high water mark must be approved by biologists from ODFW or NMFS. During removal of the concrete dam remnants the work area is well isolated from the active flowing stream within a coffer dam or similar structure (made out of sandbags, sheet pilings, inflatable bags, or similar materials), to minimize the potential for sediment entrainment. Before and intermittently during pumping of water from the areas enclosed by the cofferdams, attempts will be made to seine or dip net and release fish from the work isolation area as is prudent to minimize risk of injury. i. Seining or dip netting will be conducted by, or under the supervision of an ODFW fishery biologist experienced in such efforts. Staff working with the seining or dip netting operation must have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to ensure the safe handling of all ESA-listed fish. ESA-listed fish must be handled with extreme care and kept in water to the maximum extent possible during seining or dip netting and transfer procedures. The transfer of ESA-listed fish must be conducted using a sanctuary net that holds water during transfer, whenever necessary to prevent the added stress of an out-of-water transfer. Seined or dip netted fish must be released as near as possible to capture sites. If a dead, injured, or sick listed species specimen is found, initial notification must be made to the National Marine Fisheries Service Law Enforcement Office, in the Vancouver Field Office, 600 Maritime, Suite 130, Vancouver, Washington 98661; phone: 360/418-4246. Care should be taken in handling sick or injured specimens to ensure effective treatment and care. Dead specimens should be handled to preserve biological material in the best possible state for later analysis of cause of  b.  c.  d.  ii.  iii. iv.

With the care of sick or injured listed species or preservation of biological materials from a dead animal, the finder has the responsibility to carry out instructions provided by Law Enforcement to ensure that evidence intrinsic to the specimen is not disturbed. v. A description of any seine or dip net and release effort will be included in a post project report, including the name and address of the supervisory fish biologist, methods used to isolate the work area and minimize disturbances to ESA-listed species, stream conditions before and following placement and removal of barriers; the means of fish removal; the number of fish removed by species; the condition of all fish released, and any incidence of observed injury or mortality. Water pumped from the work isolation area will be discharged into an upland area providing over-ground flow before returning to the creek. Discharge will occur so that it does not cause erosion. Discharges into potential fish spawning areas or areas with submerged vegetation are prohibited.  vi.  vii. 2.  To implement reasonable and prudent measure #2, above, the COE shall ensure that: a. b. Disturbance of existing riparian vegetation is minimized at the project site. All areas disturbed during activities associated with this project will be planted with native vegetation specific to the project vicinity. Plantings will achieve an 80 percent survival success after three years. Equipment used in the project will be cleaned of external oil and grease and inspected for fluid leaks before operating below the bankfull elevation of the stream. Equipment will be refueled and fuel stored at least 150 horizontal distance from the stream.  c.  3.  To implement reasonable and prudent measure #3, above, the COE shall ensure that: a. Within 30 days of completing the project, the COE will submit a monitoring report to NMFS describing the COE's success meeting these terms and conditions. This report will consist of the following information: i. Project identification. (1) (2) Project name; starting and ending dates of work completed for this project, and; 9   (3) ii. iii.  the name and address of the construction supervisor.  A narrative assessment of the project's effects on natural stream function. Photographic documentation of environmental conditions at the project site before, during and after project completion.

ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT  3.1  Background  The objective of the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation is to determine whether the proposed actions may adversely affect designated EFH for relevant species, and to recommend conservation measures to avoid, minimize, or otherwise offset potential adverse effects to EFH resulting from the proposed action. 3.2 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-267), requires the inclusion of EFH  10   descriptions in Federal fishery management plans. In addition, the MSA requires Federal agencies to consult with NMFS on activities that may adversely affect EFH. EFH means those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity (MSA 3). For the purpose of interpreting the definition of essential fish habitat: Waters include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties that are used by fish and may include aquatic areas historically used by fish where appropriate; substrate includes sediment, hard bottom, structures underlying the waters, and associated biological communities; necessary means the habitat required to support a sustainable fishery and the managed species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem; and ""spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity"" covers a species' full life cycle (50 CFR 600.110). Section 305(b) of the MSA (16 U.S.C. 1855(b)) requires that:    Federal agencies must consult with NMFS on all actions, or proposed actions, authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency, that may adversely affect EFH; NMFS shall provide conservation recommendations for any Federal or State activity that may adversely affect EFH; Federal agencies shall within 30 days after receiving conservation recommendations from NMFS provide a detailed response in writing to NMFS regarding the conservation recommendations. The response shall include a description of measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, mitigating, or offsetting the impact of the activity on EFH. In the case of a response that is inconsistent with the conservation recommendations of NMFS, the Federal agency shall explain its reasons for not following the recommendations.  The MSA requires consultation for all actions that may adversely affect EFH, and does not distinguish between actions within EFH and actions outside EFH. Any reasonable attempt to encourage the conservation of EFH must take into account actions that occur outside EFH, such as upstream and upslope activities, that may have an adverse effect on EFH. Therefore, EFH consultation with NMFS is required by Federal agencies undertaking, permitting or funding activities that may adversely affect EFH, regardless of its location. 3.3 Identification of EFH  The Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) has designated EFH for Federally-managed fisheries within the waters of Washington, Oregon, and California. Freshwater EFH for Pacific salmon includes all those streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other water bodies currently, or historically accessible to salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, except areas upstream of certain impassable man-made barriers (as identified by the PFMC), and longstanding, naturally-impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for several hundred years)(PFMC 1999).  11   Detailed descriptions and identifications of EFH for salmon are found in Appendix A to Amendment 14 to the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan (PFMC 1999). Assessment of the potential adverse effects to these species' EFH from the proposed action is based on this information. The Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) has designated EFH for three species of Pacific salmon: chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha); coho (O. kisutch); and Puget Sound pink salmon (O. gorbuscha)(PFMC 1999). Freshwater EFH for Pacific salmon includes all those streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other water bodies currently, or historically accessible to salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, except areas upstream of certain impassable man-made barriers (as identified by the PFMC), and longstanding, naturally impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for several hundred years). Detailed descriptions and identifications of EFH for salmon are found in Appendix A to Amendment 14 to the Pacific Coast Salmon Plan (PFMC 1999). Assessment of potential adverse effects to these species' EFH from the proposed action is based on this information. 3.4 Proposed Action  The proposed action is detailed above in Part 1.2. The ""action area"" for this consultation includes the streambed and streambank of Milton Creek within the area of disturbance at the project site and downstream to the extent of visible short-term turbidity increases resulting from the project work. This area has been designated as EFH for coho salmon and chinook salmon. 3.5 Effects of Proposed Action  Coho salmon spawn, rear, or migrate in Milton Creek both upstream and downstream from the project site. Chinook salmon occur in the lower portion of Milton Creek approximately three miles downstream from the project site. As described in Section 1.5.1, removal of the remnants of the small concrete/rock dam on Milton Creek may cause some short-term effects to water quality (turbidity) in Milton Creek. The temporary increase in stream turbidity could result in temporarily reduced feeding efficiency for juvenile salmonids which may be present in the project area. Removal of the remnants of the concrete/rock dam will improve upstream and downstream passage conditions for both adult and juvenile coho salmon in Milton Creek. Based on StreamNet data, approximately 12.3 miles of potential coho salmon spawning and rearing habitat are available in Milton Creek upstream from the project site. Chinook salmon, which occur in Milton Creek, several miles downstream from the project site are not expected to be affected by the project. Information submitted by the COE in its request for consultation and additional information provided by ODFW is sufficient for NMFS to conclude that the effects of the proposed action are transient, local, and of low intensity. NMFS also believes that the conservation measures proposed as an integral part of the action would avoid, minimize, or otherwise offset potential adverse impacts to designated EFH for coho salmon. 3.6 Conclusion  12   The NMFS believes that implementation of the project to remove the McGilvra Dam from Milton Creek may adversely affect designated EFH for coho salmon. The project is unlikely to adversely affect designated EFH for chinook salmon in lower Milton Creek. 3.7 EFH Conservation Recommendations  Pursuant to section 305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS is required to provide EFH conservation recommendations for any Federal or state agency action that would adversely affect EFH. The conservation measures that the COE has built into the project and all of the reasonable and prudent measures and terms and conditions contained in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are applicable to salmon EFH. Therefore, NMFS incorporates each of those measures here as EFH recommendations. 3.8 Statutory Response Requirement  Please note that the Magnuson-Stevens Act (section 305(b)) and 50 CFR 600.920(j) requires the Federal agency to provide a written response to NMFS' EFH conservation recommendations within 30 days of its receipt of this letter. The response must include a description of measures proposed to avoid, mitigate, or offset the adverse impacts of the activity on EFH. If the response is inconsistent with a conservation recommendation from NMFS, the agency must explain its reasons for not following the recommendation. 3.9 Consultation Renewal  The COE must reinitiate EFH consultation with NMFS if either the action is substantially revised or new information becomes available that affects the basis for NMFS' EFH conservation recommendations (50 CFR 600.920). 4.

INTRODUCTION This document constitutes the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) consultation and Findings in accordance with sections 7(a)(2), and its implementing regulations, 50 CFR 402, and 10(a)(2)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), on the issuance of an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) to Grants Pass Irrigation District (GPID) based upon their Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the operation of Savage Rapids Dam and its appurtenant irrigation facilities for the 2001 irrigation season. In addition, this document includes the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and chinook salmon (O. tschawytscha). 1.1 Background  Southern Oregon/Northern California (SONC) coho salmon are addressed in the HCP. The SONC coho salmon are listed as threatened under the ESA. Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) steelhead (O. mykiss) and Southern Oregon/Northern California Coastal (SONCC) chinook salmon are currently unlisted, and thus not protected under the ESA nor subject to the provisions of sections 7, 9 and 10. NMFS has agreed to add the KMP steelhead and SONCC chinook to the ITP when and if the species become listed in the future. All three species occur throughout the Rogue River Basin. EFH for coho salmon and chinook salmon was approved by the Secretary of Commerce on September 27, 2000. As well as being a biological opinion (Opinion) for the proposed action of issuing an ITP for SONC coho, this document also provides the rationale and biological basis for making the decision whether to add the KMP steelhead or SONCC chinook salmon to the ITP should these species become listed, within the administrative requirements of sections 7 and 10, and subject to a subsequent determination by NMFS. Note that KMP steelhead and SONCC chinook were addressed during the development of the HCP conservation measures as if they were already ESA protected. GPID has prepared a HCP that describes the Proposed Action at Savage Rapids Dam for one year, beginning with the irrigation season of 2001 (GPID 2001). GPID proposes to continue current operations at Savage Rapids Dam based on structural and operational modifications developed during 1998-2000, with further modifications based on the timing of fish runs. During implementation of the HCP, GPID will also pursue federal authorization and funding for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam. In January of 2001, NMFS received an application package from GPID. NMFS prepared a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) to satisfy environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (1969). The distribution of the draft HCP permit application and draft EA to interested parties began and the Federal Register notice was published on March 15, 2001 (66 FR 15080), which announced the availability of the documents to the public. The comment period closed April 16, 2001.  1   NMFS prepared a Final NEPA EA on the HCP, including a response to public comments on the draft EA. This document is available to the public on the NMFS Northwest Region website. This Opinion and Unlisted Species Analysis is based on the latest HCP from GPID (GPID 2001). As well, this analysis is based on information provided in the EA and technical papers prepared prior to the development of the HCP, and various other documents cited in this document. A complete administrative record on this analysis is on file in the NMFS' Oregon State Habitat Branch Office in Portland, Oregon. Initiation of consultation is considered to have begun on the day that NMFS received the amended HCP application from GPID (January 19, 2001). The objective of this Opinion is to determine whether the proposed action to issue a permit is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of SONC coho salmon, or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat for this species. EFH for these species will be evaluated and conservation recommendations provided as needed in this document. The EFH discussion occurs at the end of this document, separate from the ESA consultation. 1.2 Proposed Action  Under the proposed action, NMFS would issue a one-year ITP to GPID for continued operation of Savage Rapids Dam and the associated irrigation facilities while GPID pursues federal authorization and funding for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam. The ITP would be based on a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) that describes GPID activities for the 2001 irrigation season. Under the HCP, GPID would continue to divert up to 150 cfs of water from the Rogue River at Savage Rapids Dam into GPID's distribution system. In addition, the GPID Board will make every effort to promote support for dam removal, and secure federal legislation to authorize and fund dam removal. 1.2.1 Facilities Description The Savage Rapids Dam is located on the Rogue River in southwest Oregon at rivermile (RM) 107 about 5 miles east of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon. Savage Rapids Dam is owned and operated by GPID. Its sole purpose is to divert water for irrigation. Fish passage at Savage Rapids Dam has been an issue since the dam was constructed in 1921 by GPID. The concrete structure has a structural height of 39 feet, and a fish ladder was constructed on the north side at the time the dam was completed. A ladder was constructed on the southside in 1934. Rotating fish screens were an initial part of the gravity diversion on the south side. Early attempts to screen the pumping diversion on the north side were unsuccessful and the diversion remained unscreened until 1958. Fish passage improvements made in the late 1970's have helped reduce fish deaths, but fish passage problems continue.  2   The dam is a combination gravity and multiple-arch, concrete structure. The dam has a structural height of 39 feet, a hydraulic height of 30 feet, and an overflow crest with a length of approximately 465 feet. The crest is divided into 16 bays. The first seven bays at the north end of the dam are of multiple-arch construction with buttresses on 25-foot centers. The rest of the bays are concrete-gravity sections. Metal stoplogs, installed and removed by a motorized cableway and hoist, control water going over the spillway section. A small, concrete-block structure above the north end of the dam houses the hoist equipment. The stoplogs raise the upstream water surface 11 feet, and are in use during the irrigation season only. In the center of the dam at bays 10 and 11 are two river outlets controlled by 16-by-7 foot, hydraulically-operated, radial gates, each with a capacity of 3,000 cubic feet per second (cfs). The gates are used to de-water the reservoir to permit access to the crest of the spillway while the stoplogs are being installed and removed. At the north end of the dam is a concrete structure designed to contain pumping equipment. The pumping facilities allow water to be pumped from the Rogue River into four canals at higher elevations, using hydraulically-powered pumps. One turbine drives a centrifugal pump which supplies water through a 42-inch pipe within the dam to the South Highline Canal and Savage Lateral on the south side of the Rogue River. The other turbine drives two pumps connected in series which supply water to the Tokay Canal and Evans Creek Lateral on the north side of the Rogue River. The two headworks are fed by the turbine and pump system on the north bank that diverts up to a total of 800 cfs from the river, 660 cfs of which drives two turbines, providing the energy for three pumps to lift about 90 cfs up to the canals. The water that drives the turbines returns directly to the tailrace of the dam. The remaining diversion from the dam is the gravity diversion into the Gravity Canal (also known as the South Canal) at the south end of the dam. Flow is regulated by two four-foot by four-foot, hand-operated, slide gates in a headworks at the upstream face of the dam. GPID facilities also includes nearly 160 miles of canals and four relift pumping plants (BOR 1995). There are fish ladders located at both the north and south sides of the dam to provide for upstream and downstream fish migration. The north fish ladder is a rectangular, concrete structure containing pools 8 feet long and 9 feet wide. The south fish ladder is a concrete structure approximately 100 feet long and divided into 10 pools. Extending from the bottom of the south ladder to the river are a series of fish resting pools and attraction channels. GPID currently serves approximately 8,000 patrons owning a total of 7,700 acres in Jackson and Josephine counties. Savage Rapids Dam provides GPID with its primary water supply via canals in the greater Grants Pass area. The water provided by GPID is not treated and thus is not used for human consumption. Of the 8,000 patrons, about 300 own more than 5 acres and the remaining 7,700 own less than 5 acres. The patrons with more than 5 acres represent a variety of 3   agricultural interests (e.g., wine grapes, sugar beets, fruit orchards, etc.), but some industrial interests are also included in this group (e.g., lumber mills, a golf course, etc). Of the 7,700 patrons owning less than 5 acres, most use GPID water for small hayfields and/or personal vegetable gardens. Many of these patrons own less than 1/4 of an acre and use GPID water on their lawns (BOR 1995). Many GPID patrons have an alternative water source because they are served by municipal water from the city of Grants Pass, but this water is more expensive than GPID water. However, most GPID patrons, especially those with more than 5 acres, are outside the city of Grants Pass and do not have an alternative water source. 1.2.2 Summary of HCP Actions  The overall goal of the HCP is to implement conservation strategies designed to minimize take of all species of concern that may be affected by the facilities and operations of the Savage Rapids Dam and associated diversion facilities, while allowing GPID to provide water to its patrons for irrigation. GPID's HCP provides mitigation and minimization measures associated with an ITP for SONC coho salmon (GPID 2001). The HCP also minimizes take for the unlisted KMP steelhead and SONCC chinook salmon. The measures described in the HCP include measures to minimize direct and indirect take, mitigation, and monitoring the impacts of covered activities on runs of anadromous salmonids. GPID generally begins diverting water in April, with water use increasing throughout the summer months of June, July and August. Historically, diversion rates begin to decline in September and the end of the irrigation season is in October. At the beginning of the irrigation season, usually in late April, the radial gates are opened to lower the reservoir pool, allowing installation of the stoplogs. Three metal stoplogs are placed in each of the 16 bays to raise the reservoir water surface elevation 11 feet above the concrete crest of the dam to an elevation of 964 feet above mean sea level. Once this is done, the radial gates are partially closed to fill the reservoir without completely interrupting riverflow. Approximately 1,000 cfs are allowed to pass until the filling is completed and the fish ladders are functioning. In addition to implementing the minimization measures and monitoring described in the HCP, GPID will continue to seek the advice of its consultants and staff to make reasonably practicable adjustments to improve fish passage at the dam. The District will devote the remaining portion of its $265,000 grant (roughly $125,000 remains unspent) from the State of Oregon to make improvements at the fish passage facilities that GPID, its consultants, and NMFS deem reasonable. GPID will continue seeking to remove Savage Rapids Dam and to replace the existing diversion facilities with new, electrically-powered pumping plants. Dam removal and construction of new diversion points is expected to proceed in accordance with federal legislation introduced on October 23, 2000, as S. 3227 (106th Congress, 2nd Session). The District is committed to continuing support of this legislation. However, the funding is uncertain at this time, and GPID proposes to continue operation of the current facility in 2001 to provide water to its patrons. 4   1.2.3  Covered Activities  Covered activities are described in the HCP, and in summary are: all GPID operations on the Rogue River at Savage Rapids Dam in conjunction with its diversion facility for 2001. This includes diversions at the north turbine/pump intake and the south gravity intake, the timing of operations, and monitoring the bypass trap. In addition, GPID will continue to pursue federal authorization and funding for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam and replacement of the dam with electric pumps for irrigation. 1.2.4 Action Area  The ""action area"" is defined within the ESA context as ""all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action."" (50 CFR 402.02). Physical activities associated with the proposed action, such as operating the north turbine/pump intake and the south gravity intake, encompass the immediate area around Savage Rapids Dam. In addition, because the operation of the dam affects fish passage to reaches upstream of the dam that are accessible to anadromous salmonids, the action area includes these areas of the Rogue River upstream of the dam. The action area also includes the reach downstream of the dam that is affected by flows. This action area also applies to EFH, as described below. The action area within the context of EFH is defined by Amendment 14 of the Pacific Coast Management Plan (1999) as ""any activity that may adversely affect EFH, regardless of its location."" This area serves as a migratory corridor for both adult and juvenile life stages of coho salmon, chinook salmon and steelhead. Essential features of the adult and juvenile migratory corridor for the species are: (1) Substrate, (2) water quality, (3) water quantity, (4) water temperature, (5) water velocity, (6) cover/shelter, (7) food (juvenile only), (8) riparian vegetation, (9) space, and (10) safe passage conditions (50 CFR Part 226). The essential features that the proposed action has the potential to affect are substrate, water quality, water velocity, and safe passage conditions. These features are also important for chinook salmon and steelhead, which overlap that of coho salmon within Elk Creek. In addition, these features are components of coho and chinook salmon EFH, as described in PFMC (1999). 2. ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT 2.1 Biological Opinion 2.1.1 Evaluation the Proposed Action  The standards for determining jeopardy are set forth in section 7(a)(2) of the ESA as defined by 50 CFR Part 402 (the consultation regulations). In conducting analyses of habitat-altering actions under section 7 of the ESA, the NMFS uses the following steps: 1) Consider the status 5   and biological requirements of the species; 2) evaluate the relevance of the environmental baseline in the action area to the species' current status; 3) determine the effects of the proposed or continuing action on the species; 4) consider cumulative effects; and 5) determine whether the proposed action, in light of the above factors, is likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of species survival in the wild or adversely modify its critical habitat. In completing this step of the analysis, NMFS determines whether the action under consultation, together with all cumulative effects when added to the environmental baseline, is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat, or both. If NMFS finds that the action is likely to jeopardize the listed species, NMFS must identify reasonable and prudent alternatives for the action. NMFS used the standards described above to analyze whether the proposed action of issuing the ITP would likely jeopardize the species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This analysis will determine to what extent the action will likely affect three species of anadromous fish addressed by the HCP and the riparian and aquatic habitats important to the anadromous salmon. The NMFS jeopardy analysis considers how the proposed action is expected to directly and indirectly affect specific environmental factors that define properly functioning riparian and aquatic habitats essential for the survival and recovery of the species under consideration. This analysis considers the species' biological requirements under the environmental baseline, and takes into consideration the overall balance of beneficial and detrimental activities taking place within the HCP. If the effects of the actions are found to jeopardize a particular species, then the NMFS could not approve the issuance of the ITP for that species. For NMFS to meet its obligation for consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, the conservation measures of the HCP proposed by GPID must be assessed to determine whether the action of issuing an ITP would; (1) Reasonably be expected to, directly or indirectly, appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of that species; or (2) result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat. 2.1.2 Biological Information and Critical Habitat  The SONC coho salmon were listed as threatened under the ESA on May 6, 1997 (62 FR 24588), critical habitat was designated on May 5, 1999 (64 FR 24049), and protective regulations were issued on July 18, 1997 (62 FR 38479). A listing of KMP steelhead was determined to be not warranted on April 4, 2001 (66 FR 9808) and a listing of SONCC chinook salmon was determined to be not warranted on September 16, 1999 (64 FR 50394). A description of the life history, biology and biological requirements for SONC coho salmon, SONCC chinook salmon and KMP steelhead can be found in Spence et al. (1996), Weitkamp et al. (1995), Myers et al. (1998), and Busby et al. (1994). Based on the best available information on fish presence within the Rogue River, the NMFS expects that adult and rearing SONC coho salmon, SONCC chinook salmon and KMP steelhead would be present in the action area during 6   the irrigation season. The proposed action would occur within designated SONC coho salmon critical habitat (64 FR 24049) and described coho and chinook salmon EFH (PFMC 1999). Critical habitat for SONC coho salmon includes all river reaches accessible to listed coho salmon between Cape Blanco and Punta Gorda. Excluded are areas above specific dams or above longstanding, naturally impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years). Freshwater critical habitat includes all waterways, substrates, and adjacent riparian areas--areas adjacent to a stream that provides the following functions: shade, sediment, nutrient or chemical regulation, streambank stability, and input of large woody debris or organic matter--below longstanding, natural impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years) and several dams that block access to former coho salmon habitat. 2.1.2.1 SONC Coho Salmon NMFS described the population status of the SONC coho salmon ESU in its status review (Weitkamp et al. 1995). Coho salmon migrate downstream passed Savage Rapids Dam as juveniles in the spring and early summer, and upstream passed the dam as adults 18 months later from October to December. Coho in the Rogue River tend to spawn in smaller tributaries below Gold Ray Dam. However, a high percentage (up to 94.4 percent in 1983) of wild coho salmon entering the Rogue River pass Gold Ray Dam upstream of Savage Rapids Dam. The percentage that pass Savage Rapids Dam would be even greater as Evans Creek, a major core area for coho salmon, enters the Rogue River between Savage Rapids Dam and Gold Ray Dam. Counts of adult coho salmon run size at Gold Ray Dam was in the neighborhood of two to four thousand fish during the 1940s, declined to less than 200 fish for most of the 1960s and 1970s, and has returned to the two to four thousand fish range during the last four years. Numbers of wild yearling coho estimated to have passed Savage Rapids Dam from mid-May through mid-July from 1975 through 1986 have ranged from 273 fish (1984) to 14,421 (1983). 2.1.2.2 KMP Steelhead The status of KMP steelhead is described in Busby et al. (1994). KMP steelhead are well distributed within the Rogue River, with two races present in the watershed (summer and winter). Adult summer steelhead enter the river from June to September, moving slowly upstream, occasionally holding near the mouth of cooler tributaries. Generally the first winter freshets cause these fish to move into smaller tributaries of the middle and upper Rogue River system. Spawning commences in mid-January. The run of winter steelhead is larger and more widely distributed. They enter the system primarily in mid-October and are found in most streams of the drainage where spawning is not precluded by a lack of flow, lack of spawning habitat, or the presence of passage barriers. Chilcote (1998) concluded that upper Rogue River steelhead populations were self-sustaining. Surveys conducted in 1999 as part of the ODFW KMP Steelhead Project determined that  7   juvenile steelhead were present in 95 of 98 randomly selected sample sites in the upper Rogue River Basin. 2.1.2.3 SONCC Chinook Salmon The status of SONCC chinook salmon is described in Myers et al. (1998). Spring and fall chinook salmon are present in the Rogue River. Adult spring chinook enter the Rogue River in the spring, remain in the main stem above Gold Ray Dam through the summer, and spawn in the fall. Fall chinook enter the system early in the fall and spawn through December, tending to use the river and tributary systems below Gold Ray Dam. Habitat loss and degradation are widespread throughout the ESU. However, the Rogue River chinook runs are considered relatively healthy compared to other rivers in the ESU. 2.1.3 Environmental Baseline 2.1.3.1 Biological Requirements The first step in the methods NMFS uses for applying the ESA section 7(a)(2) to listed salmon is to define the biological requirements of the species most relevant to each consultation. NMFS also considers the current status of the listed species taking into account population size, trends, distribution and genetic diversity. To assess to the current status of the listed species, NMFS starts with the determinations made in its decision to list SONC coho salmon for ESA protection and also considers new data available that are relevant to the determination (Weitkamp et al. 1995). The relevant biological requirements are those necessary for SONC coho salmon to survive and recover to naturally reproducing population levels at which protection under the ESA would become unnecessary. Adequate population levels must safeguard the genetic diversity of the listed stock, enhance their capacity to adapt to various environmental conditions, and allow them to become self-sustaining in the natural environment. For this consultation, the biological requirements are improved habitat characteristics that function to support successful migration. NMFS concludes that not all of the biological requirements of SONC coho salmon within the action area are currently being met under the environmental baseline. 2.1.3.2 Adequacy of Habitat Conditions in Critical Habitat The environmental baseline includes the effects of past and on-going human and natural factors leading to the current status of the species or its habitat and ecosystem within the action area. The action area is defined as all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the action (50 CFR 402.02). Direct effects occur at the project site and may extend upstream or downstream based on the potential for impairing 8   fish passage, hydraulics, sediment and pollutant discharge, and the extent of riparian habitat modifications. Indirect effects may occur throughout the watershed where actions described in this Opinion lead to additional activities or affect ecological functions contributing to stream degradation or loss of fish productivity. In this case, the proposed federal action is issuing the ITP. Indirect effects include potential impacts of injury, mortality, and increased stress on fish resulting from longer passage timing associated with the operation of Savage Rapids Dam and its diversion facilities. Mortality has the potential to affect fish production upstream of Savage Rapids Dam. The dam also influences streamflows in the reach downstream of the dam. The action area is defined in Section 1.2.4 of this document. Within the Rogue River watershed, habitat losses that began a century and a half ago have continued. Settlement and agriculture in the dry Rogue valley encouraged over allocation of most of the tributary streams as early as 1900 (Oregon Progress Board 2000). Lower flows, reduced streamside cover, and streambeds shallowed by sediment have raised stream temperatures as much as 10F in some parts of the Rogue basin. Its steep terrain makes the Klamath Mountains ecoregion particularly susceptible to landslides and debris flows, especially in extensively logged basins. Removal of large trees has exacerbated the natural effects of fire and floods in riparian areas along many rivers. Relatively few large conifers remain within the active flood plain, although historic evidence shows that conifers were once abundant in low gradient valley bottoms and were selectively logged in the 1950s and 1960s. This has limited the amount of large wood fallen into the stream which once created complex channels and buffered riparian areas against erosion from flood events. Measures of aquatic health, such as the proportion of intact riparian vegetation, suggest that extensive past damage may be reversing in some areas though changes in land use practices and habitat restoration. Despite this, native stocks of almost all of the region's anadromous fish have declined, including SONC coho salmon. Inventories of streams also found aquatic insect communities degraded throughout the area. The Rogue River watershed is experiencing a drier than normal wateryear currently. Normal flows for the Rogue River at Grants Pass is 4,000 fps for this time of year. Current flows are in the 1,500 to 2,000 fps range. 2.1.4 Effects of the Proposed Action 2.1.4.1 Effects on Essential Features Lethal and non-lethal impacts to anadromous salmonids would occur as a result of the issuance of the proposed ITP for the GPID HCP. Implementation of the HCP would result in lethal impacts including mortality of adults and juveniles coho salmon. Non-lethal impacts could include injury to fish and increased metabolic energy costs associated with migrating through the dam and reservoir.  9   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has estimated that juvenile fish losses of up to 10 percent could be expected at Savage Rapids Dam from predation, and that juvenile fish passage losses from all causes may average 10 to 15 percent. Adult fish passage losses of 10 to 30 percent are possible. The poor design of the fishways likely results in substantial delay and some mortality of adults. Predation losses are possible in the reservoir pool or tailrace due to changing the elevation of water in the pool during irrigation startup and shutdown. Potential predators include cormorants, herons, osprey, mergansers and kingfishers, all commonly observed along the Rogue River. Total mortality of juvenile salmonids related to operation of Savage Rapids Dam is estimated based on the overlap in the timing of migration with the period of dam operation, and by the proportion of flow affected by the dam. All fish entrained into the irrigation canals (both on the north and south side) die because there is no return route to the river. The turbines on the north were not designed to be ""fish friendly"", therefore approximately 30% of the entrained fish that pass through them are killed or injured; the number of fish passing through the turbines depends on the flow in the Rogue River and the effectiveness of conservation measures such as the lighting as described below. In addition, approximately half of the fish impinged by the screen die, and there is additional mortality associated with the pump. The addition of forebay lighting to attract fish over the spillway reduces the number of juveniles that are impacted by the dam. A study conducted by GPID in 1998 demonstrated that fish use of the north-side bypass system appeared to drop by 90 % on nights when lighting over the spillway was turned on. There was no increase in fish entrainment on those nights, so the fish apparently passed over the spillway as intended. However, this analysis assumes that all juveniles are migrating at night; at least some percentage must migrate past the dam during the day when the lighting would not provide attraction. The delayed start for diversion at the north turbine is designed to minimize impacts to migrating juvenile coho salmon. The traveling screen bypass trap will be operated at this location to monitor the migration of juvenile coho. If trigger numbers of coho are trapped, then GPID will shut down the diversion for 48 hours. This is designed to minimize mortality and injury to migrating juveniles. To further reduce take to juvenile coho, GPID will operate and maintain brush seals around the screens, and a screen backwash system. The most notable effects of Savage Rapids Dam on adult fish passage in the past have been on spring chinook and steelhead during periods of high flow. When flow exceeds roughly 10,000 cfs, spill occurs over all bays of the dam and the attraction flows into the ladder become difficult for adult fish to locate. This results in a delay of upstream migration until flows recede. High flows also cause problems in the fish ladders because fish tend to jump out and get stranded on the rocks below. Fences have been placed along the ladders to prevent fish from jumping out and being stranded. This does reduce mortality. However, the fencing washes out at high flows which is the same time that some adults get stranded outside the ladders. It is then difficult to replace the fencing at the high flows. 10   Lower water in the Rogue River results in a greater percentage of the flow going through the turbines, consequently more juveniles are exposed to the screens. Best estimates indicates approximately half the juveniles could be exposed to the screens. Measures to minimize injury and mortality of juveniles at the screens that have been incorporated into the HCP are important to avoid significant long-term impacts. Also, depending on air temperatures, there is the potential for higher water temperatures, which increases the risk of mortality and disease. In addition, lower flows in the fall could lead to increased delay of adult coho migrated past the dam; the effect of this delay on fish has never been quantified. The change in delay would rely on flows this fall. Total mortality of juveniles is estimated to be 10 to 15 percent by ODFW. This may be decreased by the conservation measures such as the forebay lighting. However, this will likely be off-set by the low-water year and the greater percentage of fish exposed to the turbines. Therefore, based on estimates of juvenile coho population sizes presented in section 2.1.2.1 and the effects described above, the injury and mortality of juveniles is estimated to be 1,400 fish to 2500 fish. Total mortality of adult coho salmon is estimated to be 200 to 1,200 fish. 2.1.4.2 Effects on Critical Habitat The NMFS designates critical habitat based on physical and biological features that are essential to the listed species. SONC coho salmon critical habitat was designated May 5, 1999 (64 FR 24049). SONC coho salmon critical habitat encompasses accessible reaches of all rivers (including estuarine areas and tributaries) between the Mattole River in California and the Elk River in Oregon, including all waterways and substrate below longstanding, naturally impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for at least several hundred years). Essential features of designated critical habitat include substrate, water quality, water quantity, water temperature, food, riparian vegetation, access, water velocity, space and safe passage. Because the critical habitat is inclusive of the Savage Rapids Dam action area, and the above description of the effects of the proposed action includes habitat effects, a separate description of the effects of the project on critical habitat here is not necessary. In addition, since KMP steelhead and SONCC chinook salmon occupy essentially the same habitats as SONC coho salmon, any discussion of SONC coho salmon critical habitat or effects of the alternatives on that habitat is considered applicable to KMP steelhead and SONCC chinook salmon. 2.1.5 Cumulative Effects  Cumulative effects are defined in 50 CFR 402.02 as those effects of ""future state or private activities, not involving federal activities, that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the federal action subject to consultation."" Future federal actions, including the ongoing operation of hydropower systems, hatcheries, fisheries, and land management activities are being  11   (or have been) reviewed through separate section 7 consultation processes. Therefore, these actions are not considered cumulative to the proposed action. The NMFS is not aware of any specific future non-federal activities within the action area that would cause greater impacts to listed species than presently occurs. The NMFS assumes that future private and state actions will continue at similar intensities as in recent years. 2.1.6 Conclusion  After reviewing the current status of SONC coho salmon and the environmental baseline for the action area, the effects of the proposed issuance of a one-year ITP and the cumulative effects, NMFS has determined that the issuance of the ITP, as proposed, is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the SONC coho salmon, and is not likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This finding is based, in part, on the short-term timeframe (one-year) of the ITP, the improving trend in production of coho salmon in the Rogue River, the incorporation of best management practices (BMPs) into the proposed action, and GPID's efforts to pursue federal authorization and funding for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam as a longterm solution to fish passage problems. The effects are not expected to be measurable as longterm effects on the species' population levels given the one-year duration of the action. 2.1.7 Reinitiation of Consultation  This concludes formal consultation on these actions in accordance with 50 CFR 402.14(b)(1). Reinitiation of consultation is required: (1) If the action is modified in a way that causes an effect on the listed species that was not previously considered in the biological assessment and this Opinion; (2) new information or project monitoring reveals effects of the action that may affect the listed species in a way not previously considered; or (3) a new species is listed or critical habitat is designated that may be affected by the action (50 CFR 402.16). 2.2 Incidental Take Statement 2.2.1 SONC Coho Salmon  Section 9 of the ESA and federal regulation pursuant to section 4(d) of the ESA prohibit the take of endangered species and threatened species, respectively, without special exemption. Take is defined as to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct. Harm is further defined by the NMFS to include significant habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to listed species by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, and sheltering. Harass is defined by the NMFS as intentional or negligent actions that create the likelihood of injury to listed species to such an extent as to significantly alter normal behavior patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, and sheltering. Incidental take is defined as take that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity. Under the 12   terms of Section 7(b)(4) and Section 7(o)(2), taking that is incidental to, and not intended as part of, the agency action is not considered to be prohibited taking under the ESA provided that such taking is in compliance with the term and conditions of this Incidental Take Statement. The proposed Operation of Savage Rapids Dam HCP and its associated documents clearly identify anticipated impacts to affected species likely to result from the proposed taking and the measures that are necessary and appropriate to minimize those impacts. All conservation measures described in the proposed HCP and the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit issued with respect to the proposed HCP, are hereby incorporated by reference as reasonable and prudent measures and terms and conditions within this Incidental Take Statement pursuant to 50 CFR 402.12(I). Such terms and conditions are non-discretionary and must be undertaken for the exemptions under section 10(a)(1)(B) and section 7(o)(2) of the ESA to apply. If the permittee fails to adhere to these terms and conditions, the protective coverage of the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit and section 7(o)(2) may lapse. The amount or extent of incidental take anticipated under the proposed Operation of Savage Rapids Dam HCP, associated reporting requirements, and provisions for disposition of dead or injured fish are as described in the HCP and its accompanying section 10(a)(1)(B) permit. NMFS particularly wants to emphasize the following terms and conditions: 1. The existing traveling screen bypass trap will be operated at the North Turbine-Pump Intake, unless NMFS and GPID agree to some other location. The bypass trap will be installed prior to diversion of any water. Monitoring and triggers for shut down will occur as described in the HCP. Monitoring reports shall be submitted to: National Marine Fisheries Service Oregon State Branch, Habitat Conservation Division Attn: OSB2001-0083-FFEC 525 NE Oregon Street, Suite 500 Portland, Oregon 97232-2778 3. GPID will minimize the amount of time the radial gates are open, especially when installing or removing the flash boards, to minimize delays of upstream adult fish passage. The operation of the radial gates in the fall should coincide with periods when runs of adult coho salmon are at their lowest (minimum number of fish moving in the river) to reduce the adverse impacts to migration. This timing should be closely coordinated with ODFW, NMFS, and Oregon Department of Water Resources.  2.  4.  13   5. 6.  GPID will continue to pursue federal authorization and funding for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam. If a dead, sick or injured Oregon Coast coho salmon is located, immediate notification must be made to Frank Bird, NMFS, telephone: (541) 957-3383, or Chris Knutsen, ODFW, telephone: (503) 842-2741. Care will be taken in handling sick or injured specimens to ensure effective treatment and care or the handling of dead specimens to preserve biological material in the best possible state for later analysis of cause of death. In conjunction with the care of sick or injured species or preservation of biological material from a dead animal, the finder has the responsibility to carry out instruction provided by Law Enforcement to ensure that evidence intrinsic to the specimen is not unnecessarily disturbed.  The NMFS anticipates that the proposed action covered by this Opinion has more than a negligible likelihood of incidental take of SONC coho salmon over the one-year life of the permit. The incidental take of this species is expected to be in the form of harassment, kill and injury, resulting from covered activities under the HCP. Effects of actions such as these are estimated below for the short term, and are not expected to be measurable as long-term effects on the species' population levels given the one-year duration of the action. The effects of these activities on population levels not expected to be measurable in the long term, given the short-term duration of the action. Total mortality of juveniles is estimated to be 10 to 15 percent by ODFW. This may be decreased by the conservation measures such as the forebay lighting. However, this will likely be off-set by the low-water year and the greater percentage of fish exposed to the turbines. Therefore, based on estimates of juvenile coho population sizes presented in section 2.1.2.1 and the effects described above, the injury and mortality of juveniles is estimated to be 1,400 fish to 2500 fish. Total mortality of adult coho salmon is estimated to be 200 to 1,200 fish. 2.2.2 KMP Steelhead - Unlisted Species  Take of KMP steelhead is not prohibited. NMFS anticipates that an undetermined amount of mortality of KMP steelhead may occur as a result of implementation of the proposed action. The impacts would occur as described above for coho salmon. 2.2.3 SONCC Chinook Salmon - Unlisted Species  Take of SONCC chinook salmon is not prohibited. NMFS anticipates that an undetermined amount of mortality of KMP steelhead may occur as a result of implementation of the proposed action. The impacts would occur as described above for coho salmon.  14   2.3  Section10(a)(2)(B) Findings 2.3.1 Permit Issuance Considerations  Although only coho salmon are listed under the ESA at this time, this document is intended to provide GPID assurances that they will receive an incidental take permit if, during the term of the permit, unlisted species are subsequently listed under the ESA. In order to issue and incidental take permit under 50 CFR 222.22(c)(1), NMFS must consider the following: 1. The status of the affected species or stocks. The status of anadromous salmonids potentially affected by the HCP has been considered above (see Section 2.1.2). The environmental baseline for anadromous fish and their habitats (Section 2.1.3) was also considered. 2. The potential severity of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on anadromous salmonids and their habitats as a result of the proposed activity. The impacts of the HCP were examined above (Section 2.1.4). 3. The availability of effective monitoring techniques. Monitoring of the implementation of the HCP and the effectiveness of the HCP conservation measures are a critical feature of the HCP. A monitoring report will be completed and submitted to NMFS at the completion of the irrigation season. 4. The use of the best available technology for minimizing or mitigating impacts. The conservation measures established in the Operation of Savage Rapids Dam HCP represent the most recent developments in science and technology in minimizing take associated with the operation of the dam and its diversion facilities. 5. The views of the public, scientists, and other interested parties knowledgeable of the species or stocks or other matters related to the application. A NEPA analysis was conducted and a Record of Decision was issued in March 1997 for fish passage improvements at Savage Rapids Dam. The federal action agency at that time was the Bureau of Reclamation. The preferred alternative (Pumping Alternative) included replacing the GPID pumping and diversion facilities at the dam with two new pumping plants, removing the dam and appurtenant structures and restoring the site, and forgiving the remaining GPID debt to the federal government. This alternative has not been implemented. However, participation by the public and by state, federal, county, and local entities were an integral part of the NEPA process. Public participation was initiated in 1987. GPID began a public involvement program in 1990. Public meetings were held in 1991 and 1993. Three newsletters were sent out in 1991 and 1992. The draft Environmental Impact Statement was distributed in 1994, and a public meeting was held in 1995.  15   For the issuance of the ITP for GPID's HCP, public comments were solicited on the completed permit application package and the draft Environmental Assessment (EA) (GPID 2001, NMFS 2001). The availability of the documents for public review was announced in the Federal Register (66 FR 15080). The permit application package and draft EA were also mailed directly to 11 federal and state legislators, five federal and state agencies, Jackson County, Josephine County, Grants Pass and the Rogue Valley Council of Governments, as well as three libraries and eight organizations. The comment period ended April 16, 2001, and during that time five letters, 1 e-mail and one phone call were received. All these comments are summarized in the final EA. 2.3.2 Permit Issuance Findings  Having considered the above, the NMFS makes the following findings with regard to the adequacy of the HCP meeting the statutory and regulatory requirements for an Incidental Take Permit under Section 10(a)(2)(B) of the ESA and 50 CFR aSection 222.22(c)(2): 1. The taking of listed species will be incidental to irrigation activities. NMFS anticipates that the proposed action would likely result in incidental take of threatened southern Oregon/northern California coho salmon, and other currently unlisted species of anadromous salmonids, if they are listed. Activities that will occur during the implementation of the HCP that may result in take (mortality and injury) include operation of the diversion facilities, pumps, fish ladders and the dam itself. Some instances of incidental take will likely occur despite the conservation measures in the HCP. The take is not quantifiable, and would be limited in extent to the vicinity of the dam and the appurtenant facilities. 2. GPID will, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, minimize and mitigate the impacts of taking of anadromous salmonids associated with the operation of dam and the appurtenant facilities. Measures in this HCP minimize and mitigate for take impacts that may occur, through alteration of operations if trigger numbers of fish are caught in the bypass trap, operation and maintenance of a brush seal at the base of the traveling screens as well as a screen backwash system, operation and maintenance of the new screen at the south gravity intake, monitoring of impingement, and operation of the forebay lighting. GPID will pursue federal authorization and funding for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam. The removal of Savage Rapids Dam, if authorized and funded, would greatly reduce the take of coho salmon associated with the operation of GPID's irrigation program. Finally, GPID will monitor its operations to determine the effectiveness of the take minimization measures. The HCP provides specific conservation measures to monitor, minimize, and mitigate the impact of take of SONC coho salmon under the permit. 3. Based on the best available scientific information, the taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild, or adversely modify or destroy critical habitat for SONC coho salmon. Conservation measures will minimize take during key migration periods, and the take authorized will be limited to one irrigation season. 16   The ESA's legislative history establishes the intent of Congress that this issuance criteria be based on a finding of ""not likely to jeopardize"" under section 7(a)(2) [see 50 CFR 402.02)]. This is the identical standard to section 10(a)(2)(B). The conclusions regarding jeopardy for the listed ESU and for all other unlisted anadromous salmonids are found in section 2.1.6 in the Opinion above. In summary, NMFS has considered the status of the species, the environmental baseline and the effects of the proposed action, and any indirect and cumulative effects, to conclude that issuance of the Incidental Take Permit for SONC coho and any unlisted species as described above, would likely not jeopardize the continued existence of any of the anadromous salmonids addressed in the HCP. 4. The plan has been revised to assure that other measures, as required by NMFS, have been met. The HCP incorporates all elements determined by NMFS to be necessary for approval of the HCP and issuance of the permit. 5. NMFS has received the necessary assurance that the plan will be funded and implemented. The HCP commits GPID to adequately fund implementation of the HCP. In addition, the State of Oregon provided a $265,000 fund for interim fish passage improvements at the dam, of which roughly $125,000 remains unspent. These funds are available for further operational and structural improvements deemed reasonable by GPID and NMFS. 2.3.3 Conclusion  Based on these findings, it is determined that GPID's HCP meets the statutory and regulatory requirements for an Incidental Take Permit under section 10(a)(2)B) of the ESA and 50 CFR  222.307. 2.3.4 Procedures in the Event of Listings  Should any of the currently unlisted plan species subsequently become listed, GPID may propose to add that species to the permit. If such an amendment request is received, NMFS will determine whether such addition would meet the permit issuance criteria under ESA section 10(a)(2)(B). If the species to be added is already addressed in the HCP, the NMFS wil consider, in making the required determinations, the extent to which GPID's implementation of the HCP, or any other voluntary conservation measures undertaken by GPID since issuance of the permit, have already minimized or mitigated for negative effects on the species. It is expected that, upon listed of a currently unlisted species, additional information will be available in any proposed, final, or emergency listing to determine the habitat and life-history requirements of the species, the range-wide status, threats to the species, applicable management recommendations, and other basic information necessary to complete the amendment processes. Before such species would 17   be added to the permit, NMFS must find that adding the species to the permit would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the affected species in the wild and would be consistent with its other responsibilities. 3. MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT In addition to ESA consultation, consultation is required for Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The objective of the EFH consultation is to determine whether the proposed action may adversely affect designated EFH for relevant species, and to recommend conservation measures to avoid, minimize, or otherwise offset potential adverse impacts to EFH resulting from the proposed action. The proposed action of issuing a permit for activities at Savage Rapids Dam may adversely affect EFH for Pacific salmon (chinook and coho). 3.1 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act  EFH provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) require heightened consideration of fish habitat in resource management decisions. EFH is defined in the section 3 of the MSA as ""those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity."" The NMFS interprets EFH to include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical and biological properties used by fish that are necessary to support a sustainable fishery and the contribution of the managed species to a healthy ecosystem. The MSA and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR 600.920 (j) require that before a federal agency may authorize, fund or carry out any action that may adversely effect EFH, it must consult with NMFS and, if requested, the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council. The purpose of consultation is to develop a conservation recommendation that addresses all reasonably foreseeable adverse effects to EFH. Further, the action agency must provide a detailed response in writing to NMFS and the appropriate Council within 30 days after receiving an EFH conservation recommendation. The response must include measures proposed by the agency to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or offset the impact of the activity on EFH. If the response is inconsistent with conservation recommendations of NMFS, the agency must explain its reasons for not following the recommendations, including the scientific justification for any disagreements over the anticipated effects of the proposed action and the measures needed to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such effects. This consultation requirement does not distinguish between actions which occur within EFH and actions outside EFH. Any reasonable attempt to encourage the conservation of EFH must take into account actions that occur outside EFH, such as upstream and up slope activities that may have an adverse effect on EFH. Therefore, EFH consultation with NMFS is required by federal agencies undertaking, permitting or funding activities that may adversely affect EFH, whatever its location.  18   3.2  Identification of Essential Fish Habitat  The Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) has designated EFH for federally-managed fisheries within the waters of Washington, Oregon, and California. The designated EFH for groundfish and coastal pelagic species encompasses all waters from the mean high water line, and upriver extent of saltwater intrusion in river mouths, along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, seaward to the boundary of the U.S. exclusive economic zone (200 miles)(PFMC 1998a, 1998b). Freshwater EFH for Pacific salmon includes all streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other water bodies currently, or historically accessible to salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, except areas upstream of certain impassable man-made barriers (as identified by the PFMC), and longstanding, naturally-impassable barriers (i.e., natural waterfalls in existence for several hundred years) (PFMC 1999). In estuarine and marine areas, designated salmon EFH extends from the nearshore and tidal submerged environments within PFMC is one of eight Regional Fishery Management Councils established under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The PFMC develops and carries out fisheries management plans for Pacific coast groundfish, coastal pelagic species and salmon off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, and recommends Pacific halibut harvest regulations to the International Pacific Halibut Commission. Pursuant to the MSA, the PFMC has designated freshwater and marine EFH for chinook and coho salmon (PFMC 1999), EFH for five species of coastal pelagic species (PFMC 1998a), and a ""composite"" EFH for 62 species of groundfish (PFMC 1998b). For purposes of this consultation, freshwater EFH for chinook and coho salmon in Oregon includes all streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other water bodies currently or historically accessible to chinook or coho salmon, except upstream of the following impassable dams: Opal Springs, Big Cliff, Cougar, Dexter, Dorena, Soda Springs, Lost Creek, Applegate, Bull Run, Oak Grove, and the Hells Canyon Complex. In the future, should subsequent analyses determine the habitat above any of these dams is necessary for salmon conservation, the PFMC will modify the identification of Pacific salmon EFH (PFMC 1999). Marine EFH for chinook and coho salmon in Oregon includes all estuarine, nearshore and marine waters within the western boundary of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), 200 miles offshore. 3.3 Proposed Actions  The proposed action is detailed above in Section 1.2. The action area encompasses the area immediately associated with Savage Rapids Dam, in addition to areas upstream and downstream of the dam that are influenced by flow modifications caused by the dam. 3.4 Effects of the Proposed Action  The NMFS concludes that the effects of this project on designated EFH are likely to be within the range of effects considered in the ESA portion of this consultation, and concurs with the  19   finding that the proposed issuance of the ITP is likely to adversely affect EFH designated for Pacific salmon (chinook and coho). 3.5 Conclusion  The NMFS believes that the proposed action may adversely affect designated EFH for the Pacific salmon (chinook and coho). 3.6 EFH Conservation Recommendations  The Terms and Conditions outlined above in Section 2.2 are applicable to designated Pacific salmon EFH. Therefore, NMFS recommends that they be adopted as EFH conservation measures. Should the federal action agency, in this case NMFS, adopt and implement these recommendations, potential adverse impacts to EFH would be minimized. NMFS has accepted the conservation measures and they have been incorporated into the terms of the Incidental Take Permit 3.7 Consultation Renewal  The NMFS must reinitiate EFH consultation if the action is substantially revised in a way that may adversely affect EFH or new information becomes available that affects the basis for NMFS' conclusion regarding EFH conservation recommendations (50 CFR 600.920). 4.

GX261-01-10052547	State: Project No:  Wisconsin F-95-P-17  FINDING  OF NO  SIGNIFICANT  IMP ACT  For the reasonsbriefly presentedbelow and basedon an evaluation of the information contained in the supporting referencesenumeratedbelow, I have determined that removal of the Schweitzer Dam at Polk, Wisconsin on Cedar Creek (Washington County) is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect the quality of the human environment with the meaning of Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. An Environmental Impact Statementwill, accordingly, not be prepared. Reasons:  I. There are no known or anticipated endangered,threatenedor candidate species or designated critical habitat that will be adversely affected (p. 18, section 3.2.1 of EA and attached Intra-Service Section 7 fonn). 2. No known historic properties will be affected (p. 18, section 3.2.2 of EA). 3. This is the last of five dams to be removed from the upper and middle reaches of Cedar Creek (25 miles) (p. 5, section 1.4 of EA). 4. Removal of the Schweitzer darn will not impact the surrounding land use and land values (p. 21, section 4.15 of EA). 5. Removal of the dam will not have any noticeable effect on flood levels upstream or downstream of the darn during major floods (p. 21, section 4.1.5 of EA). 6. Cumulative effects of removing this dam are consideredpositive, as its removal will eliminate the last of five darnswhich prevented nonnal fish migration and acted as a navigation hazard (p. 22, section 4.1.8 of EA). 7. Carp and other non-native fish in the impoundment will be captured and destroyed as the impoundment water is lowered (p. 30, Chapter 7 of EA). 8. Public review of the Draft EA resulted in one comment, which was addressedin the EA ( Chapter 7) and in item 7 above. SUDl20rting References:  1. Environmental Assessment (EA) 2.

Purpose and Need 1.1 Introduction This document serves as the Environmental Assessment (EA) for a project that considers a variety of management alternatives for a dam and resulting impoundment, generally owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Department) on Cedar Creek, Town of Polk, Washington County, Wisconsin. The purpose of an EA is to disclose, explain, and evaluate the environmental effects of a proposed government action to the decision -makers and the public. The EA descr ibes and evaluates alternatives to the proposed course of action. The draft EA was circulated for public review and comment between July 3 and August 3, 2002 and to ensure public participation in the process . This document, the final EA, includes inform ation obtained and comments made during the public comment period. Given the current state of the surface water resources effected by the Schweitzer dam and resulting impoundment, this document considers several alternatives for management of the Schweitze r Dam, its impoundment, and Cedar Creek. The project is proposing to be partially funded by Federal Sport Fish Restoration Funds that are administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Natural Resources. Because of the funding source, the project must comply with both the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act (WEPA) including Chapter NR 150, of the Wisconsin Administrative Code and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) consist ent with Part 1500 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This EA has been prepared to meet both Federal and State laws that require full public disclosure of projects that may affect the quality of the human environment.  1.2 Purpose for the Proposed Action The primary goal of this project is to evaluate various management alternatives with a common goal to improve the ecosystem of the Cedar Creek Watershed by improving water quality, restoring habitat for native species, and enabling fish migration.  1.3 Need for the Proposed Action The needs that should be met by the selected Alternative are: 1. 2. Provide for fish passage along the upper reaches of Cedar Creek, Restore the original thermal regime and habitat found in Cedar Creek which supported native cool and cold water species while reducing habitat for non -native warm water species (e.g. common carp and Eurasian watermilfoil), Enhance the diversity and extent of wetland and upland plant communities (e.g. calcareous fen), Minimize the liabilities associated with owning and maintaining a dam, and Ensure that the private riparian landowner has a water source for continued operation of his residential heat pump.  3. 4. 5.  1.4 Background The project is located in the Cedar Creek Watershed, Milwaukee River Basin, Washingt on County, Wisconsin. The entire Cedar Creek Watershed encompasses 126 square miles of drainage. Cedar Creek flows approximately 30 miles from its origin at the outlet of Little Cedar Lake to the Milwaukee River east of Cedarburg. While agriculture remains the dominant land use in the watershed, Washington County is one of the fastest developing counties in the State of Wisconsin.  4   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment The immediate project area is located in the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of Section 14, Township 10 N., Range 19 East, Town of Polk. It is bounded by Lily Road on the downstream side of the project area and Cedar Creek Road on the upstream side of the project area. It is in the uppermost reaches of the Cedar Creek Watershed draining approximately 16 square miles , or 13% of the total watershed drainage area. Besides Cedar Creek, the project area also includes the Schweitzer dam, the 9.75 acre Schweitzer impoundment and its attendant dam and earthen berm. A. Schweitzer and Joseph Merkel built the existing dam in 1946, possibly for the purpose of raising fish in the approximate 10-acre pond formed by the dam. There is no record that fish were raised here and the dam and resulting impoundment never served any purpose than forming the shallow pond. The Schweitzer Dam is the last authorized dam along the middle and upper reaches of Cedar Creek. There were five other dams along a 2.5 mile reach of upper Cedar Creek and these structures were formally abandoned or informally breached prior to 1963 (WCD, 1963). The Sc hweitzer Dam is the last dam and fish migration barrier along 25 miles of free flowing Cedar Creek, extending from the Cedarburg Pond dam in Cedarburg upstream to the headwaters of Cedar Creek at the Little Cedar Lake outlet.  The dam and entire impoundment shoreline was held as private property until the dam and portions of the shoreline and surrounding uplands were purchased by the Department. The Department currently owns 18.5 acres of property in the project area. The property includes the entire 9.7 5 acre Schweitzer Pond, the concrete dam structure and earthen embankment, and 8.75 acres of surrounding wetlands and uplands. The property was purchased to preserve some outstanding river corridor features, including a regionally rare wetland community type, a 0.3-acre calcareous fen, and to protect water quality. The Department purchased this property from Ben and Mary Jo Pencikowski. The Pencikowski's retained their residence in addition to 5 acres of upland as required by local zoning. In addition, the Pencikowski's use the existing pond as cooling water to operate a small residential heat pump system.  The existing dam and impoundment limits the water based biological and recreational use potential of Cedar Creek. The existing dam prevents migration of fish and the resulting impoundment is shallow and infested with non-native and nuisance amounts of Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum . Eurasian watermilfoil covers greater than 90% of the pond surface during the peak summer growing and recr eating period. The deep muck and dense Eurasian watermilfoil beds make swimming and wading difficult and uninviting. Sedimentation has reduced the effective water depth of the impoundment to less than 6 feet. While game fish  5   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment and pan fish populations ar e present, common carp are the dominant fishery comprising 78% of the measured fish community biomass . The impoundment is also responsible for elevating maximum daily mean summer water temperatures from 0.5 o C to 4.1 oC above upstream conditions, and avera ged 1.7 oC above upstream water temperatures. Previous records indicate the presence of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout, Salmo trutta in the upper Cedar Creek watershed as recently as 1976 in Cedar Creek, and 1987 in Lehner Creek and Pol k Springs two principal tributaries of Cedar Creek (Fago, 1984; Bozek and Wakeman, 1986). Recent and extensive use of conservation easements and land acquisitions along streams, installation of agricultural best -management practices such as buffers, and d am removals may allow restoration of these cold water fish and other aquatic life species.  1.5 Decisions That Need to Be Made To meet WEPA requirements, the EA evaluates probable environmental effects of the various feasible alternatives associated with t his project. Based on the findings contained in the EA, state and federal personnel will decide if there is a need to complete a more thorough Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) consistent with the WEPA. Upon completion and public review of the EA, t he Services Regional Director (Region 3, USFWS) will select one of the alternatives analyzed in detail and will determine, based on the facts and recommendations contained herein, whether this EA is adequate to support a Finding of No Significant Impact (F ONSI) decision, or whether an EIS will need to be prepared.  2. Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action A summary of the various alternatives, associated activities and summary of their ability to meet the projects purpose and need, as described in section 1.2 and 1.3, are described below and are presented in Tables 1a and 1b.  2.1 Alternatives Not Considered for Detailed Analysis Besides the alternatives carried over for more detailed analysis, there were three alternatives that were excluded from detailed analysis. All of these later alternatives proposed to maintain the existing dam structure and impoundment.  Maintain Dam with Partial Drawdown First, the option of letting the structure remain in place and simply lowering the gates to enable the river to fl ow freely through the structure was considered. Leaving the dam in place and allowing the water to flow through the gates would lower water surface elevations in the pond by only 3.5 feet. A 4 to 6 -foot spillway would remain making fish passage impossibl e. Extending the residential cooling tubes into deeper water might allow continued use of the remaining pond to operate the residential heat pump system. Although water retention times in the pond would decrease, water temperatures would still be excessi ve for the maintenance of a cool or cold water fish and aquatic life community. Habitat would remain preferable for common carp and other fish and aquatic life species more tolerant of degraded environmental conditions. Water depths would decrease to an average of 2.2 feet and the nuisance growth of Eurasian watermilfoil and algae would persist. The safety and liability issues associated with operating and maintaining a dam would remain, with actual costs for operation expected to increase slightly.  Maintain Dam with Seasonal Drawdown Another alternative not considered for detailed analysis was allowing for the passage of fish at certain times of the year by opening the gates at certain periods that coincided with the annual spring spawning runs of specif ic species. Removal of all stop logs from the dam structure still leaves a 4 to 6 -foot change in water surface elevation between upstream and downstream levels making fish passage impossible. This alternative would permit continued use of the remaining po nd to operate the residential heat pump system during the summer  6   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment cooling season only (June through September). Summer water retention times in the pond would be unchanged and would be excessive for the maintenance of a cool or cold water fish and aquatic life community. Habitat would remain preferable for common carp and other fish and aquatic life species more tolerant of degraded environmental conditions. Seasonal water depths would decrease an average of 2.2 feet. This condition would desiccate normally submerged near shore areas where most of the resident fish population spawning and nursery cover exists. Nuisance growth of Eurasian watermilfoil and algae would persist and seasonal water level fluctuations would encourage invasive vegetation at the expense of native wetland communities. The safety and liability issues associated with operating and maintaining a dam would remain, with actual costs for operation expected to increase slightly.  Maintain Dam with Fish Passage The third alternative not c arried forward for detailed analysis would involve the continued operation of the existing dam, and construction and operation of a passive or active fish passage structure. The Department would incur additional long -term operation and maintenance costs f or a fish passage structure. The fish passage structure could not be designed so to guarantee use and passage by all native fish present in the project area. The site constraints would make construction difficult and expensive and would likely require st ream channel realignment and possible relocation. Under this alternative, the residential heat pump system would be unaffected. The remaining impacts and benefits of this alternative would be similar to the previous alternatives. Habitat would remain pr eferable for common carp and other fish and aquatic life species more tolerant of degraded environmental conditions. Under this alternative, water temperatures within the impoundment and downstream of the dam would exceed water temperatures measured upstr eam of the impoundment in free flowing reaches of Cedar Creek, and in excess of levels needed to maintain a cool or cold water fish and aquatic life community. To summarize, these three alternatives were rejected from further consideration because they wo uld not partially or fully meet the purpose and needs proposed for this project. The Department would continue to incur the liabilities attendant to maintaining and operating a dam. A significant portion of the dam structure would remain and would still represent a complete barrier to fish passage. The dam and resulting impoundment would continue to maintain a shallow and warm pool of water dominated by heavy submerged plant growth and generally poor aquatic habitat quality. Water temperatures within th e pond and downstream of the dam would continue to exceed the 22 0C Maximum Daily Mean (MDM) criteria for a cool or cold water fish and aquatic life community which currently exists upstream of the impoundment. In all of the alternatives described above, t he pond is too shallow and detention times too short to allow for a stratified thermal regime and potential cold water discharge. Eurasian watermilfoil would persist and carp would remain the dominant fishery. Both would proliferate and would remain a co ntinuing source for downstream reaches. The opportunity to enhance the diversity of wetland and terrestrial plant communities, including a rare calcareous fen, would not exist.  2.2 Alternatives Carried Forward for Detailed Analysis 2.2.1 Alternative A (Proposed Action)  Remove Dam, Restore the Creek Channel and Create an Off-Line Replacement Pond The preferred alternative includes removing the Schweitzer formed river channel and exposed sediment, and restoring t for cooling purposes by creating a small (< 0.25 acre) pond Creek. The pond would be constructed with shallow water wildlife. Once completed, the private landowner would be Dam, restoring and enhancing habitat in the newly he riparian landowners ability to use the pond water adjoining his property but removed from Cedar shelves and planted with native plants t o encourage responsible for maintenance of the replacement pond.  If selected, this project would be undertaken in four phases. Phase I involves controlled draw down of the impoundment and temporary seeding of exposed sediment. Phase II includes removal of the dam structure and partial removal of the associated earthen berm. Phase III involves short -term stabilization and creation of a replacement cooling and wildlife pond. Phase IV includes long -term stabilization and restoration of the former impoundment including re-vegetation of exposed sediment, and streambank and channel protection using engineered and bioengineered practices as appropriate.  7   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  Phase I - Site Access and Draw Down Site access will be gained by using an existing ""road"" along the top of the approximately 300 -foot long berm to the north of the concrete dam structure. Minimal improvements to the berm -top road will be needed for travel by light machinery (e.g. pick-up trucks). Some limited cutting of trees and shrubs may be required to improve access. The majority of these plants are box elder. Additional gravel may be brought in to widen the berm -top road in subsequent phases of the project so that larger tracked equipment (e.g. bac khoe) may access the site. In addition, an unimproved access road to the south of the dam structure may be constructed. The road would cover up to 600 lineal feet of agricultural upland. The road would require a temporary easement from an adjoining prope rty owner. At the end of the roadway, equipment would have to traverse a 2 on 1 slope to access the dam structure from the south. This would require the removal of a dozen or less tree consisting of box elder and black willow, some woody shrub, and lesse r numbers of cottonwood, silver maple, and basswood. The first task was completed in July 2001 and involved the removal of boards from the dam structure. This resulted in a surface water drop of approximately 2 feet. This task was completed to expose a p ortion of the shoreline to assess the native seed bank content, assess the water budget to the calcareous fen, and to locate the potential free-flowing channel following removal of the dam. If this alternative is chosen, a concrete -cutting chain saw will be used to progressively cut notches into the concrete dam structure. Each notch will remove up to a 4 -foot by 2 -foot by 1 -foot (1/4 cubic yard) section of dam structure, allowing the drawdown of the former impoundment to progress at a controlled rate. Concrete debris generated in this phase will be allowed to fall to the downstream side of the structure onto the concrete slab spillway, and will be removed along with the rest of the structure in subsequent phases of work. As soon as possible after the initial drawdown, Department staff will seed the exposed sediment with a nurse crop of Canada wild rye or annual rye to re -vegetate and stabilize exposed sediments. The purpose for establishing the nurse crop is to control erosion and encourage de -watering of the exposed sediment while not out competing beneficial native vegetation in the sediment seed bank.  Phase II - Removal of Dam Structure; Re-grading of Earthen Dike Dam Structure Removal. Once the draw down is complete, the remaining dam structure w ill be removed. There are several methods for dam removal that may be employed at this site. The most likely method will be to use an excavator-mounted concrete breaker, along with an oxyacetylene torch to cut rebar. Another, more labor intensive method may be to use a concrete -cutting chainsaw to cut the structure into manageable pieces for removal. Wherever possible demolition activity will be conducted from the banks of the river or the dry impoundment. Some of the demolition of the tailrace and dam w ill have to be conducted in the waterway. Where work must be conducted in the river the effects of turbidity will be controlled using modified turbidity barriers. The scour hole below the dam will also be maintained and used as a sediment trap. The demol ition of the dam will begin in the center of the dam, equidistant from both riverbanks. Demolition work will be conducted progressively, moving back toward both riverbanks. Demolition of the tailrace will be conducted as the last step in the demolition activity. Concrete rubble and rebar will be removed and disposed off site in an approved demolition waste landfill. Rebar free concrete may be reused as a base for areas to be treated with rip rap. Northern Earthen Berm Re-grading. The earthen berm to th e north of the former dam structure will be re graded at a 4H:1V slope, from a spot 10 feet north of the creek bottom to the top of the berm. The purpose of this re-grading is to ensure that there is adequate flood -flow capacity through this formerly cons tricted area, and to minimize the potential for scour along the northern creek bank. The estimated volume of material to be re -graded is about 500 yd 3. Re-grading to the north of the former dam structure will entail about 60 lineal feet of disturbance hor izontally along the existing earthen berm. The disturbance path may be up to 100 feet wide, for a total possible impacted area of 6,000 square feet. The trees and shrubs along this stretch of berm will be removed, and include black willow and box elder.  8   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment Southern Earthen Berm Re-grading. The earthen berm to the south of the former dam structure will be re graded at a 3H:1V slope, from a spot 5 feet south of the creek bottom to the top of the berm. As with grading along the northern section of the berm, t his re-grading is proposed to ensure adequate flood -flow capacity, and to minimize the potential for scour along the southern creek bank. The estimated volume of material to be re -graded is about 350 yd 3. Re-grading to the north of the former dam structure will entail about 45 lineal feet of disturbance horizontally along the existing earthen berm. The disturbance path may be up to 100 feet wide, for a total possible impacted area of 4,500 square feet. The trees and shrubs along this stretch of berm will be removed, and include black willow, box elder and silver maple. Some of this woody vegetation would have been removed during earlier construction of the southern site access road.  Phase III  Creation of Off-Line Replacement Pond The actual design of t he pond will be performed in cooperation with the design professionals hired by the owner of the affected heat pump system. Construction of the pond will likely be conducted after the dam has been removed, and after the mudflats have had sufficient time t o stabilize (3-6 months). The pond design may vary, but the maximum dimensions are known. The maximum surface area of the pond is about 0.25 acres. The maximum water depth will be between 12 and 15 feet. The maximum amount of material that will be excavated to create the pond will be about 2,000 cubic yards of floodplain soils. The pond may include low sloping submerged shelves to encourage plant diversity and wildlife cover. Excavated soils will be managed on-site and will not negatively impact list ed, proposed or candidate species. Based on the historic air photos, it appears that the likely stream plan form will establish itself 50 m (164 feet) from the edge of the proposed pond. As such, the pond will not affect the hydrology or morphology of Ced ar Creek.  Phase IV  Long-Term Site Stabilization and Restoration (4-60 months after dam removal) We do not know for certain what the stream planform will look like following dam removal. Therefore, we are proposing to give the stream at least a year in w hich to ""find its way"" before we attempt any streambank restoration or stabilization. About a year after dam removal, we will conduct a channel assessment, noting physical dimensions, surveying boundaries, and recording the measures of bank and bottom chan nel stability. Following this streambank conditions survey, we will design and install bank protection, toe protection, and grade control structures only as necessary to prevent excessive sediment loss and continuing channel instability. We will prefer t o rely on the local exposed sediment seed bank to provide the basis for a long -term plant management program. In the event that additional intervention is needed to increase plant diversity and densities dependent on site conditions, or control nuisance p lants, native grass species and varieties will be added to areas as appropriate. Depending on availability, bare root woody shrubs may be planted as soon as possible after the drawdown. A short -list of potential plant species is provided in Appendix 1. Th e final seed selection will depend on local soil conditions and the availability of preferred plant species already present in the seed bank. Erosion and Sediment Control. All phases of construction site erosion will be mitigated according to the Wisconsin Best Management Practices Handbook. Site characteristics, such as gradient and direction of slopes, overland flow, and the location of paved areas and buildings near the site, will be considered. Best Management Practices (BMP's) for erosion control wi ll be undertaken in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 216 and local ordinances. These will include, but may not be limited to placement and maintenance of filter fabric fence, straw bales, and vegetative strips in appropriate locations. Em phasis will be placed on retaining any soil storage piles and ensuring the stream bank remains as stable as possible. Silt fence will be the main method used to control sediment runoff into the river. Silt fences will be placed along the stream bank, wit h an additional silt fence along the down slope side of the access roads.  9   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment A summary of the various jurisdictional authorities, and required review and approvals for the proposed Alternative A is available in Appendix 2.  2.2.2 Alternative B (No Action)  Repair and Operate Dam The ""no action"" alternative includes keeping the dam and impoundment in place as is. An informal inspection of the Schweitzer Dam was completed in June 2001. The inspection indicated that the dam and attendant dam infrastructure were in generally good condition. Some concrete spalding was noted along the spillway and abutments. If this alternative is selected, the Department will be required to repair and maintain the dam. Pursuing this ""no action"" alternative would create a long -term financial liability for the Department.  2.2.3 Alternative C  Repair and Operate Dam, and Enhance Impoundment by Dredging In cooperation with the USFWS, the Department gathered information and requested public comments on the proposed dam removal alternative prior to finalizing this EA (Appendix 7 and 8). While no formal comments were received, the Department received a voice mail message from a resident of the area suggesting that the Department maintain the existing dam structure and pool of water formed by th e dam. In addition, the individual suggested that dredging the impoundment could enhance the impoundment fishery and reduce the ""weed"" growth. The Department agreed to carry this alternative forward. For planning purposes, this alternative assumed that the pond would be hydraulically dredged to a depth of 11 feet (50,000 cu.yds). To discourage an unsafe sudden drop for waders, a minimum 3:1 slope would be excavated along the entire pond shoreline. Although it was recognized that the 11 -foot dredge dep th would not be entirely effective in reducing nuisance growth of Eurasian watermilfoil, dredging beyond 11 feet would place the bottom elevation of the pond below the dam spillway. Dredging below the 11 -foot spillway elevation would prohibit the ability to cause a full drawdown without the benefit of mechanical pumping or siphoning. Why technically feasible, dredging the pond would increase operation and maintenance costs considerably. The dam would be maintained in its current condition and would be ope rated in a ""run of the river"" mode. Run of the river infers that the discharge over the dam would be equal to water entering the impoundment by surface water drainage and groundwater seepage with no deviation of discharge through dam gate manipulation. In essence, the minimum water elevations and resulting depth within the pond would be set by the elevation of the dam spillway. Similar to Alternative A, this alternative would be undertaken in phases. Phase I would involve all of the detailed planning for the project, developing site access to the impoundment, locating and constructing a dredge spoil disposal site, and the carriage return water treatment and disposal infrastructure, as appropriate. Phase II would involve mobilization, assembly and deployme nt of the hydraulic dredge and dredge spoil pumping system. Phase III would involve the dredging, pumping and disposal of dredge spoils, treatment and disposal of carriage return water. Phase IV would include disassembly and de -mobilization of all of the dredge apparatus and dredge spoil piping system, and management of the dredge spoil disposal area by de -watering, grading and vegetation planting as appropriate.  Phase I  Planning, Site Access, Locating and Constructing Dredge Spoil Disposal Site Similar to Alternative A, site access would be gained by using an existing ""road"" along the top of the approximately 300-foot long berm to the north of the concrete dam structure. Minimal improvements to the berm-top road will be needed for travel by light mach inery (e.g. pick-up and flatbed trucks). Some limited cutting of trees and shrubs may be required to improve access. The majority of these plants are box elder. If this alternative were chosen additional lands would need to be acquired, through fee and t itle or construction easement, to construct a sediment disposal and carriage water treatment facility. The existing state land surrounding the project area is narrow and steep. As such, a neighboring land site would be needed. Once acquired, the disposa l site would need to be engineered ands constructed to accept, confine and de -water up to  10   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment 50,000 cu. yds of dredge spoils and associated return water. No natural depressions large enough to accept this volume of dredge spoil exist in the area so it is lik ely the site would require some excavation and construction of berms. A forebay may be included to trap coarse particle (e.g. sand) and other large debris. Sizing of the sediment confinement area will depend on sediment volumes and water content, infiltr ation rates, loading rates, particle size, surface areas and estimated evaporation rates, topography, desired carriage return water quality, and other variables. This phase is estimated to take at least one year 1 -year to complete assuming a suitable disp osal site could be located and acquired in very close proximity to the project area. Similar to Alternative A, this alternative would require the state to apply for and receive a variety of permits from local and state agencies, depending on the specific activity (e.g. dredging, grading and discharge of carriage water).  Phase II - Mobilization, Assembly and Deployment of Dredge and Dredge Spoil Pumping System This phase would involve transport and assembly of the dredge system and supporting infrastructure including but not limited to the barge, cutting head, power system for dredge and pump, and piping for transport of the dredge spoils to the upland disposal site. This phase is estimated to take at least one year 1 -month to complete.  Phase III  Dredging, Pumping and Disposal of Dredge Spoils, Treatment and Disposal of Carriage Water This phase involves the actual dredging, transport and disposal of the dredge spoils, as well as the removal, treatment and discharge of the water extracted from the dredge spoils at the disposal site. The dredging and transport of the sediment is relatively simple. However, once placed in the confined disposal area, removing and treating the water before being discharged to surface or groundwater becomes more difficult. I n many respects, the sizing of the disposal area will be governed by the amount of water generated by the dredging operation. In all likelihood, the carriage return water will need to be monitored to insure that it will not negatively impact surface water or groundwater quality. This phase of the project is expected to take from 4 to 6 weeks.  Phase IV  De-mobilization of Dredge Apparatus and Dredge Spoil Management This phase of the project includes disassembly and de -mobilization of the dredge and pipi ng. Once the disposal site is adequately de -watered, it would likely be graded and seeded with a temporary or final native seed mix. To the extent possible, the disposal site will be restored to its former land use and cover. Erosion and Sediment Control. All phases of construction site erosion will be mitigated according to the Wisconsin Best Management Practices Handbook. Site characteristics, such as gradient and direction of slopes, overland flow, and the location of paved areas and buildings near th e site, will be considered. Best Management Practices (BMP's) for erosion control will be undertaken in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 216 and local ordinances.  11   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  Table 1a Summary of Management Alternatives Not Considered for Detailed An alysis Alternatives Maintain Dam with Partial Drawdown Activity Permanently open dam spillway gates.

Alternative C  Repair and Operate Dam and Enhance Pond by Dredging  Operate and maintain existing dam structure, and dredge pond to an average depth of 11 ft.  3 Affected Environment 3.1 Physical Environment The Schweitzer impoundment covers an area of about 9.75 acres, and is form ed by a 10 -foot head concrete dam. It is approximately 1,200 feet in length with an average width of 325 feet. A. Schweitzer and Joe Merkel built the dam in 1946. Public Service Commission documents filed by Mr. Schweitzer show that he was interested in raising fish in the pond formed by his dam. Mr. Schweitzer apparently never raised fish in his pond, and the dam never served any purpose other than forming the shallow, 10 -acre pond. The pond occupies the site of a much older dam and impoundment, the rem nants of which can be seen downstream of the earthen berm adjacent to the dam. The records are not entirely clear but the original dam permit application states that ""this is an old dam site, the original pond being about 16 acres, what remains of the dam backs up the water to cover 4 to 5 acres."" Aerial photographs taken in 1941, prior to construction of the present dam structure, do not reveal any impounded acreage. The present dam structure includes a concrete dam and spillway, and a 300 -foot long earthen dike. The concrete dam structure is approximately 10 feet tall and 20 feet across with a width that ranges between 6 and 10 feet.  13   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  Cedar Creek Aerial photographs taken in 1941 prior to dam construction  Average water depth in the pond is about 5.7 feet, with a maximum water depth of about 8 feet. A layer of unconsoli dated sediments overlying hardpan material exists in the pond, with an average sediment thickness of 1.8 feet, and a maximum observed sediment thickness of nearly 6 feet. These sediment deposits detract from full and partial body contact forms of recreati on such as swimming and wading. Although the dam and impoundment were never used for the intended purpose, the former dam owner and riparian continues to use the pond for cooling his residence with a closed loop heat pump and coil system. The cooling coils extend approximately 20 feet from the shoreline in approximately 3 -4 feet of water. Water temperatures within the Schweitzer Pond are elevated above upstream levels during the warm summer months. Schweitzer Pond summer (June through mid -September 2001) daily mean water temperatures were from 0.5 oC cooler to 4.1 oC warmer than water temperatures measured upstream of the pond. On average, Schweitzer Pond water temperatures were 1.7 oC warmer than water temperatures measured along free-flowing reaches just upstream of the pond. Summer daily mean water temperatures within and downstream of the Schweitzer dam and pond routinely exceed 22 oC and hourly water temperatures routinely exceed 25 oC. These trends suggest that the thermal impacts of the Schweitze r dam and pond may be limiting the establishment of a cool or cold water fish and aquatic life community (see figures below).

Beginning in late 1980, many of the most severe water quality problems from runoff have been abated. Buffers have been established through conservation easements or other mechanisms , and five historical dams have been abandoned or removed.  3.2 Biological Environment Surface Water Resources. The impoundment supports a warm water fish and aquatic life community (Appendix 3). A total of 12 species of fish were collected during year 1999 and 2000 surveys. Common carp, Cyprinus carpio made up a large share of the fish community comprising 78% of the fish community biomass. Game fish include northern pike Esox lucius, and largemouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu . Panfish are dominated by blu egill, Lepomis macrochirus, with lesser numbers of green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus , pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibosus , and black crappie, Pomoxis nigromaculatus . Based on a 1975 record, a single specimen of lake chubsucker, Erimyzon sucetta, was collected fro m the pond. This species is currently listed on the states Special Concern list. The lake chubsucker is present in other Cedar Creek Watershed waterbodies including Cedar Creek, the North Branch of Cedar Creek, Tilly Lake and Hasmer Lake all of which are located downstream of the Schweitzer impoundment (Fago, 1984). The lake chubsucker is also common in Big Cedar Lake and Little Cedar Lake located 3 miles upstream of Schweitzer pond (John Nelson, pers. com.). According to Becker (1983) and Lyons (2000), the lake chubsucker is uncommon to common in low -gradient streams and lakes in southeastern Wisconsin. Rooted aquatic vegetation is very abundant at nuisance levels, covering all of the pond surface area during warm water periods. Non -native Eurasian watermilfoil is by far the most abundant macrophyte in the impoundment covering greater than 90% of the ponds surface during the summer growing season. This dense watermilfoil growth can make recreational boating and fishing more difficult. Lesser amounts o f common waterweed, Elodea canadensis , Coontail, Ceratophyllum demersum , Fragrant water-lily, Nymphaea odorata , and non -native Curlyleaf pondweed, Potamogeton crispus, are also present. Emergent aquatic vegetation is present along the upper limits of the pond and shoreline. They include Broad -leaf cattail, Typha latifolia, and Softstem bullrush, Scirpus validus.  15   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  Schweitzer Pond and Dam August 2000 Eurasian watermilfoil and filamentous algae Cedar Creek upstream and downstream of the Schweitzer dam and pond currently support a warm water fish and aquatic life community. A comb ined 12 taxa of fish were collected from Cedar Creek upstream of the pond during 1999 and 2000. Creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus , green sunfish, yellow bullhead, Ameiurus natalis , and horneyhead chub, Nocomis biguttatus, comprised 76% of the collected fish biomass. Young -of-the-year largemouth bass were the only sport fish captured. A combined 17 taxa of fish were collected from Cedar Creek downstream of the pond during 1999 and 2000 (Appendix 3). Common white sucker, Catostomus commersoni , creek chub, largemouth bass and horneyhead chub comprised 71% of the fish biomass. Historical fish distribution records from 1976 and 1986 include brook trout or brown trout collections from the Lehner Lake outlet, Polk Springs and Cedar Creek. The collections wer e made from the same approximate drainage area in the upper Cedar Creek watershed known to have more active areas for groundwater discharge (Bozek and Wakeman, 1986; Fago, 1984). Habitat upstream of the Schweitzer Pond is considered ""good"" for smaller bod ied fish. The reach is made up of riffle and run complex and pools are generally absent. Deeper runs and small woody debris dams provide additional depth and cover. Average maximum depth in runs is 0.31 m and average depth for the reach is 0.16 m. Large cobble and coarse gravel are dominant substrate averaging 46% and 21%, respectively. Embeddedness is moderate but not excessive at 35%. Stream banks are stable with a minimal amount of mean bare soil. The corridor is undeveloped wetland and shading is 80%. Tamarack and wet deciduous forest are the dominant land use and the water surface is well shaded at 80%.  Cedar Creek upstream of the Schweitzer impoundment.  16   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment There are two distinct reach types immediately downstream of the Schweitzer Dam. The reach immediately downstream of the dam is unique to t he upper reaches of Cedar Creek in that it has a high gradient. It is made up almost entirely of riffle with the exception of a short run located midway through the reach and a large and deep (1.5 m) scour pool formed immediately below the dam raceway. C over is generally lacking with exception of some occasional woody debris. Average water depth for the reach is 0.14 m. Large cobble and coarse gravel are dominant substrate averaging 48% and 24%, respectively. Embeddedness is relatively low at 20%. Stre am banks are stable with a minimal amount of mean bare soil. The corridor is undeveloped and dominated by wet deciduous forest. Stream shading from the dense tree canopy is high at 85%. Wet deciduous forest is the dominant land use and the water surface is well shaded at 80%.  Cedar Creek immediately downstream of the Schweitzer Dam and upstream of Lily Rd.  Downstream of the reach described above, Cedar Creek returns to a more typical moderate gradient stream type. Riffles are the dominant feature with lesser amounts of run and pools are absent. Cover is generally lacking with exception of some occasional boulder. Average water depth for the reach is 0.19 m and the maximum depth was 0.26 m. Large cobble and coarse gravel are dominant substrate averaging 31% and 37%, respectively. Embeddedness is relatively low at 22% and sands and silt-sized substrate comprise 24% of the bottom material. The corridor is undeveloped and dominated by wet meadow and lesser amounts of shrub carr with corridor widths well in excess of 10 m. Prior to 1990, livestock over grazed the corridor. The prese nt sedge, grass and shrub root structure contributes to very stable bank conditions and a minimal amount of bare soil. Shading is minimal at 11%. The lack of shade and adequate nutrient supply contributes to extensive filamentous algae growth covering 70% of the stream bottom. Cedar Creek downstream of Schweitzer Dam and Lily Road  17   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment Other Wildlife Resources. Wildlife (mammal) species observed in the vicinity of the Schweitzer Dam and impoundment include whitetail deer, muskrat, mink, raccoon, muskrat, gray and fox squirrel, chipmunk, and coyote. Bird specie s include robin, cardinal, warbler, chickadee, catbird, kingfisher, great blue heron, red -winged blackbird, flycatchers, Canadian geese, mallard ducks, wood ducks and marsh wrens. Vegetation and Land Cover Resources. The Schweitzer Dam and impoundment are located in the Town of Polk. The land uses surrounding the impoundment include floodplain and upland deciduous forest, a 0.3 acre calcareous fen, a 0.5 acre southern sedge meadow (sedge fen), shallow marsh and pond, and one residential lot. With exception of the small residential lawn area adjacent to the impoundment, the corridor along the impoundment and Cedar Creek is undeveloped. The entire plant community has been identified by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) as Cla ss II, or good quality, wetland wildlife habitat area, and are located within a primary environmental corridor (SEWRPC, 2000). Dominant tree species include green ash, Fraxinus pennsylvanica , american elm, Ulmus americana L ., willow spp., Salix spp., cotto nwood, Populus deltoides , box elder, Acer negundo , and tamarack, Larix laricina. Shrub types include common juniper, Juniperus communis, willow spp., Salix spp., young green ash, Fraxinus pennsylvanica , dogwood, and sumac. Herbaceous plants include Virgi nia wild rye, Elymus virginicus , redtop grass, Agrostis stolonifera , fen mulhy grass, Muhlenbergia glomerata , reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea , sterile sedge, Carex sterilis, sedge, Carex granularis , tussock sedge, Carex stricta, bottlebrush sedge, Carex hystericina, short-headed rush, Juncus brachycephalus , joint rush, Juncus nodosus , virginia blueflag, Iris virginica, scouring rush, Equisetum hyemle, blue vervain, Verbena hastata , great blue lobelia, Lobelia siphilitica, yarrow, Achillea millefolium, giant goldenrod, Solidago gigantea , grassleaf goldenrod, Solidago graminifolia , ohio goldenrod, Solidago ohioensis (state Special Concern), red -stemmed aster, Aster puniceus , swamp aster, Aster lucidulus , joe-pye weed, Eupatorium maculatum , and boneset , Eupatorium perfoliatum .  3.2.1 Listed, Proposed and Candidate Species Based on a review of the Natural Heritage Inventory (NHI) Database and several surveys of the area there are no federal or state listed, proposed or candidate species located in the project a rea or that would otherwise be affected by any of the alternatives described in this EA. The Ellipse mussel, Venustaconcha ellipsiformis , is located in Cedar Creek approximately 3 -miles downstream of the project site. This mussel is listed as a State Th reatened Species. None of the alternative management alternatives discussed in this would negatively impact this mussel. There are two State Special Concern Species, the lake chubsucker and ohio goldenrod, Solidago ohioensis, located in or adjacent to t he project area. A calcareous fen is located adjacent to the impoundment. This is a regionally rare wetland plant community identified as significant in the Natural Heritage Inventory (NHI) (Appendix 4). The impacts of the various alternatives on these later two species and associated community will be discussed for each alternative in Section 4 that follows.  3.2.2 Cultural and Paleontological Resources The State Historic Protection Office (SHPO) and Tribal Historic Protection Office (THPO) have determined tha t the Schweitzer Dam and its associated complex does not have historic significance hence there would be no impact to any historical properties within the project area (Appendix 5 and 6).  3.2.3 Local Social/Economic Conditions The 1997 population of Washington County was 110,629. The City of West Bend is the largest city in the county with a population of 28,100. It is located 5 miles north of the project area. Based on 2001 statistics, Washington County was one of the fastest growing residential county in th e state. There are no prime agricultural lands in the vicinity of the dam or impoundment.  18   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  4  Environmental Consequences  4.1 Alternative A (Proposed Action)  Dam Removal, Restore the Creek Channel and Create Off-Line Replacement Pond 4.1.1 Biological Impacts Removal of the Schweitzer Dam and resulting impoundment would eliminate the last barrier to fish migration in the upper Cedar Creek watershed and 25 miles of Cedar Creek. Genetic health and diversity of species that had fragmented populations because of the dams blocking fish movement will be improved. The existing warm and eutrophic impoundment habitat that is more supportive of fish and aquatic life tolerant of degraded environmental conditions, will be modified. Absent the impoundment, habitat for large bodied warm water game fish will be reduced. Non -native species, such as carp and native species that are indicative of poor water quality and degraded habits, such as bullhead and green sunfish, will become les s common as conditions improve for desirable stream species. A free -flowing stream habitat more conducive to a cool or cold water fish and aquatic life community will be re -established, including the potential establishment of a recreational trout fishery. If the dam is removed, large bodied fish may be stranded in shallow water or the scour hole below the dam. Large bodied game fish will be removed and transported to Little or Big Cedar Lake. Because of the large numbers of carp present in the impoundm ent, no attempt will be made to recover stranded carp. As a result, a number of carp will perish. Small -bodied panfish and forage fish, including lake chubsucker, will be able to move downstream or upstream of the former dam and impoundment site. The da m breach will occur over a number of days to reduce the number of stranded fish. If the dam is removed, it will no longer serve as a carp nursery for the system or as a source for Eurasian watermilfoil. A higher quality nine -acre wetland area, including the potential to expand a rare calcareous fen and a free-flowing cool or cold water stream will replace the eutrophic impoundment. The off -line replacement and operation of the residential heat pump and cooling tubes pond will not have any deleterious impacts on local or downstream fish and aquatic life communities. The pond will be designed and landscaped with native vegetation to provide wildlife habitat amenities. The pond will off set some of the wildlife habitat formerly associated with the impoundm ent.  4.1.2 Habitat Impacts If the dam is removed, physical habitat will improve in the former impoundment as silt is scoured from the historic rock-riffle substrates. Increasing in the amount of coarse substrate will benefit macroinvetebrate species diversity and biomass. The thermal impacts of the impoundment will be eliminated. As a result, water temperatures within and downstream of the former dam and impoundment will be similar to water temperatures upstream of the impoundment. This alternative would allo w the opportunity to restore up to nine acres of wetland formerly inundated by the impoundment. Following the initial breach of the dam, an unknown amount of non -cohesive sediment will be lost from behind the impoundment and dam sill. As a result, turbidi ty levels will increase initially and then return to ambient conditions. Attempts will be made to capture coarse sediment in the scour hole located below the dam. This alternative reduces water surface area by approximately 9 acres. This would reduce the amount of loafing habitat and open water for a variety of waterfowl and waterbirds. However, most of these species are expected to continue to use the river if the dam is removed. Of those species most potentially effected, the diving ducks or those that require large stretches of open water, would likely use suitable loafing sites elsewhere in the area, most notably the Big and Little Cedar lakes, Hasmer and Tilly Lakes, and several smaller ponds located within 2 to 3 miles from the project area. The pr oposed replacement pond will also provide some of these habitats.  19   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment As a result of dam removal and site restoration, habitat conditions would be expected to improve for common bird species in the area. Following restoration, suitable grass/forb or grass/shr ub cover types would attract and provide feeding habitat for raptors. Edge species such as house wrens, gray catbirds, and American goldfinches would use the riparian cover for nesting and feeding sites. Nesting habitat and foraging perches would improve for riparian warblers, notably the yellow warbler and the common yellow throat. Ground nesting waterfowl, such as the blue -winged teal and mallard, would also use established grassy areas as secure nest cover. The increased use by birds would also attr act raptorial and mammalian predators, such as the great -horned owl, American kestrel, red-tailed hawk, and the red fox. Feeding habitat for birds using the adjacent wooded uplands would improve. Many of the summer residents would consume the seeds and i nsects produced in the riparian vegetation. Bird watching opportunities would increase with the influx of species adaptable to newly established riparian vegetation on the mud flats. Viewing opportunities would increase as the vegetation matures and at tracts migratory and summer resident birds. Local citizens who winter feed birds may note an increase in bird diversity at their feeding stations. Songbirds attracted to the corridor are usually opportunistic, seeking available food sources and alternati ve feeding sites during periods of harsh winter weather. No mammals are expected to be displaced as a result of full dam removal. Most of the mammals are terrestrial; therefore any addition of terrestrial habitat would improve cover for these species. The continued presence of riverine habitat would attract species such as the little brown bat (an aerial insectivore), raccoon, mink and muskrat. Exposed sediment stabilization and revegetation would benefit many of the common mammalian species. Common s pecies expected to benefit include: opossum, shrews, mice, voles, Eastern cottontail rabbit, red fox, coyote, and white -tailed deer. Although these species expanded their territories into the floodplain after the drawdown, their origin was most likely the adjacent wooded uplands. Ultimately revegetation of the exposed sediment will improve habitat conditions for these mammals. Feeding/foraging sites would increase. Loafing sites and escape cover would also improve in the shrubby growth of the mud flats. As a result, populations of certain species may increase. Under this alternative, no change in amphibian diversity is expected. The exposed and stabilized mud flats would provide suitable feeding sites and nesting cover for beneficial snakes, such as t he garter snake. Snake abundance is expected to increase as the riparian habitat matures and produces suitable prey such as small frogs, insects, mice, and snails. Turtle numbers are not expected to noticeably change. Exposed mud flats will be used as basking sites or egg-laying habitat for snapping turtles and painted turtles.  4.1.3 Listed, Proposed and Candidate Species There are no federal or state listed, proposed or candidate species located in the project area or that would otherwise be affected by thi s project. The state listed Special Concern species, the lake chubsucker, is resident to the Schweitzer impoundment. Removal of the dam and impoundment will cause many resident fish to become dislocated. Small -bodied fish such as the lake chubsucker wil l likely be re-located downstream of the dam to deeper, low -gradient reaches of Cedar Creek. Their populations are known to occur elsewhere in the Cedar Creek watershed including Big and Little Cedar Lakes, Tilly Lake, Hasmer Lake and Cedar Creek (Fago, 1 984 and Nelson, pers. comm.). Their abundance in the state appears to be stable (Lyons, 2000). The ohio goldenrod, Solidago ohioensis is a state listed Special Concern species and the plant is located in a calcareous fen community located adjacent to t he impoundment. A calcareous fen is a regionally rare, open wetland found in southern Wisconsin, often underlain by a calcareous substrate marl, through which percolates carbonate-rich groundwater percolates. The flora is typically diverse, with many cal ciphiles or calcium-loving plants. Calcareous fens and the wetland plants they support are especially sensitive to the quality and depth of groundwater that supports them. As such, locally fluctuating surface water levels may disturb the groundwater sources that support these wetlands. However, removal of the dam and resulting impoundment should not negatively impact this plant species or the calcareous fen that supports it. Prior to and following the initial 2 -foot drawdown of the impoundment during Ju ly 2000, groundwater effecting the fen was observed discharging well  20   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment up gradient of the impoundment surface water and upper bank. Furthermore, removal of the dam and impoundment may actually benefit the ohio goldenrod and the calcareous fen community by e xpanding the available adjoining habitat previously inundated by the impoundment. Removing the dam and impoundment will not cause the fen to be impacted by non -native invasive species.  4.1.4 Cultural and Paleontological Resources There are no historical or arch eologically significant properties in the project area (Appendix 5 and 6).  4.1.5 Land Use and Ownership Issues Selection of this alternative will not impact the surrounding land use and land values. The project will result in the elimination of a 9.75 -acre impoundment that will be replaced with a free -flowing stream and 9 acres of wetland. Both impacted landowners riparian to the impoundment, the state of Wisconsin and private landowner, support the dam removal option. The exposed sediment will be enhanced as a wetland community. The newly created wetland will be managed in native plant species. The land currently flooded by the impoundment is owned by two entities: the State of Wisconsin, and one private landowner. The only private holding is on the northeast side of the current impoundment. A memorandum of understanding has been signed between the Department and the private landowner. The purpose of this agreement is to allow the state and its contractor(s) access to the private lands for purposes of pond co nstruction and dam demolition, should the dam be removed. Removal of the dam and resulting impoundment would eliminate the liabilities associated with dam ownership and operation, and the replacement pond will insure that the residential heat pump system continues to operate efficiently and maintains its value to the owner. Some areas affected by the dam and impoundment will change. The river channel will be narrower upstream of the dam, and over time, will be similar to channel conditions that exist ups tream and downstream of the dam and impoundment. Removal of the dam will not have any noticeable effect on flood levels upstream or downstream of the former dam during major floods. The Schweitzer dam was not a flood control dam and has operated as a run of the river facility. Therefore the floodplain downstream of the dam will not be affected and there should be no impact on downstream flooding. In future flood events without the dam in place, the floodplain in the former impoundment will be reduced in size. The aesthetic qualities formerly associated with the impoundment would be replaced with those of a wetland landscape and free -flowing stream. Recreational boating would be limited to using a canoe or other shallow drafting watercraft during higher s tream flow periods. The parcel will be managed as a natural area. No active forms of recreational facilities will be developed.  4.1.6 Risks and Unknowns (W EPA Component) Consistent with the requirements set forth in WEPA; there are no unknowns associated with t his project. The results of dam removals are predictable. Hydrology and stream morphology will eventually reflect pre -dam conditions. Kanehl (et al. 1997) described the enhanced fish community and habitat response to a similar dam removal in the Milwaukee River Basin. Hundreds of dams have been removed in the State of Wisconsin within the regulatory guidelines in Chapter 31 of the Wisconsin Statutes.  4.1.7 Precedents (W EPA Component) This action is not considered to be precedent setting. Similar to previous d am removal projects in the state, removal of this dam will further demonstrate there are alternatives to repair and maintenance of aging dam structures and that dam removal can improve water quality, aquatic and terrestrial habitat, enhance native biological communities, restore natural water and landscapes, and protect public rights in navigable waters.  21   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment The activities proposed to occur under this alternative do not conflict with the plans, rules or policy of local, state or federal agency. The proposed da m removal is consistent with recommendations contained in two previously adopted plans for managing the surface water resources of the Milwaukee River Basin (WDNR, 1990 and 1995). These plans recognize that dam removal is a sound practice for restoring th e environmental integrity of riverine systems. To date, 10 of the previous 52 authorized dams located in the Milwaukee River Basin have been formally abandoned.  4.1.8 Cumulative Impacts The cumulative impacts associated with this dam removal alternative are gen erally viewed as being positive. Removing the Schweitzer dam would eliminate the last of five dams which served as fish migration and navigation hazard along the upper 25 -miles of Cedar Creek, extending from the outlet of Little Cedar Lake (river mile 30) to the Cedarburg Pond dam in the city of Cedarburg (river mile 5). The historical cumulative thermal impacts of these dams would be eliminated. Removal of the Schweitzer dam would not be expected to increase the range of non -native fish or other aquatic life already established in the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan basins. Four dams would remain on Cedar Creek between Cedarburg's Cedarburg Pond dam (river mile 5) and Cedar Creek's confluence with the Milwaukee River (river mile 0). These structures w ould remain a barrier to fish migration and a navigation hazard. The owners of these remaining dams have not expressed an interest in abandoning these dams.  4.2 Alternative B (No Action) - Repair the Dam and Leave the Existing Impoundment In Place 4.2.1 Biological Impacts Continued maintenance of the dam and impoundment would have a long -term series of negative environmental consequences. The dam structure would continue to be a complete and last remaining barrier to fish passage in the upper Cedar Cr eek watershed. Fish populations would remain fragmented by the dam and the genetic health and diversity of fish species would remain compromised. Under this alternative, the dam would maintain a shallow and warm pool of water dominated by heavy submerged plant growth and generally poor aquatic habitat quality. The potential to create a recreational trout fishery would not exist. Eurasian watermilfoil would persist and carp would remain the dominant fishery. Both would proliferate and would remain a con tinuing local source and for downstream reaches. Although the impoundment habitat would remain habitat limited, retaining the impoundment would provide adequate depths to maintain a limited game fish population dominated by largemouth bass and some northe rn pike. Wildlife habitat currently served by the impoundment would be retained. Consistent with the objectives of this project to enhance or restore the natural values of the Cedar Creek watershed, there would be no opportunity to restore up to nine acr es of wetland including expansion of a rare calcareous fen.  4.2.2 Habitat Impacts Following this alternative, water fish and aquatic life community. habitat would remain conducive Water depths and overall habitat sediment from upstream sources temperatures would continue to exceed the 22 0C MDM criteria for a cold water The potential to create a recreati onal trout fishery would not exist. Overall to fish and other aquatic life tolerant of degraded environmental conditions. quality would be expected to decrease over time as the accumulation of as well as the accumulation of decomposing plant material will continue.  There would be no dam breach related loss of sediment from behind the impoundment. The opportunity to restore up to nine acres of historical wetland and associated wildlife habitat would not exist under this alternative. Dam retention would maintain existing water surface levels, slow water velocity, and continue to inundate potentially restorable wetlands.  22   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment Dam retention would maintain the large, open slack-water area favored as loafing sites by waterfowl and other water birds. Swallows would continue to use the open water of the corridor as hunting areas for insects. Kingfishers would utilize the overhanging tree limbs as hunting perches. Maintaining the existing dam and impoundment would prohibit the restoration of the historical floodplain wetland habitat for many of the areas most common bird species. Less common species, notably the migratory warblers, would not benefit by maintaining the habita t created by the current dam and resulting impoundment. Maintaining the existing pond and dam would not increase bird watching opportunities, as no new attractive cover for bird use would be created. Under this alternative, habitat for the most common mamm al species would be maintained at current levels. These species would not be displaced from the corridor since all except the muskrat would use the adjacent wooded bluffs for cover. The herpetile community is not expected to appreciably change under this alternative. Amphibians would continue to use the placid backwater areas for breeding, tadpole development and for feeding areas. No additional Garter snake habitat would be created under this alternative. Snakes would seek cover in the adjacent wooded bluffs. Nest sites for turtles would continue to be limited to the dry uplands along the bluffs that surround the pond. The number of turtle basking sites would be unchanged.  4.2.3 Listed, Proposed and Candidate Species There are no federal or state listed, p roposed or candidate species located in the project area or that would otherwise be affected by this alternative. The state listed Special Concern species, the lake chubsucker, is resident to the Schweitzer impoundment. Maintenance of the dam and impound ment will not cause any impact to this species. The ohio goldenrod and calcareous fen located adjacent to the impoundment should not be negatively impacted by maintaining the current dam and impoundment. As described previously for Alternative A, groundwa ter was observed to be discharging from the fen well up gradient of the impoundment prior to and following the initial 2 foot drawdown. Maintaining the dam and impoundment will not likely result in any natural expansion of the ohio goldenrod or calcareous fen community. Maintaining the dam and impoundment will not cause the fen to be impacted by non -native invasive species.  4.2.4 Cultural and Paleontological Resources There are no historical or archeologically significant properties in the project area (Append ix 5 and 6).  4.2.5 Land Use and Ownership Issues Selection of this alternative will not impact the current use of the impoundment or the surrounding land use and land values. The 9.75 -acre impoundment will be maintained. No new or enhanced wetlands would be cr eated. Implementing this alternative would permit continued use of the remaining pond to operate the residential heat pump system. The maintenance and operation of the heat pump system does not negatively impact fish, aquatic life or wildlife populations or their habitat. The aesthetic qualities associated with the impoundment would remain. Recreational boating would be possible with small watercraft. Boating, especially motorized forms, would be difficult during the summer peak Eurasian watermilfoil growing season. Following this alternative, the Department would be required to maintain and operate the Schweitzer dam. Funding for operation and future maintenance is not available as the Department purchased this facility with the intent for abandoning an d removing the structure. This alternative would not require the construction of a  23   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment replacement pond, and as such, would not result in any additional costs to the Department or the residential heat pump owner. The activities proposed to occur under this al ternative do not conflict with the plans, rules or policy of local or federal agency. However, maintenance of the existing dam and impoundment is not consistent with recommendations contained in two previously adopted plans for managing the surface water resources of the Milwaukee River Basin (WDNR, 1990 and 1995). These plans recognize that dam removal is a sound practice for restoring the environmental integrity of riverine systems. To date, 10 of the previous 52 dams located in the Milwaukee River Basin have been abandoned. The parcel will be managed as a natural area. No active forms of recreational facilities will be developed.  4.1.9 Risks and Unknowns (W EPA Component) There are no unknowns associated with this alternative. The negative environmental co nsequences of dams on riverine systems are well understood. The specific impacts attendant to the Schweitzer dam and impoundment have been described earlier. Maintenance of the dam and impoundment would cause these impacts to persist indefinitely.  4.1.10 Precedent (W EPA Component) Consistent with WEPA requirements, this action is not precedent setting. Numerous dams are maintained and operated throughout the state for a variety of management reasons. The activities proposed to occur under this alternative do not conflict with the plans, rules or policy of local or federal agencies provided the dam structure is properly maintained. However, maintaining the dam is inconsistent with recommendations contained in two previously adopted state plans for managing the surface water resources of the Milwaukee River Basin (WDNR, 1990 and 1995). These plans recognize that dams have negative environmental impacts, and conversely, dam removal is a sound practice for restoring the environmental integrity of riverine systems.  4.2.6 Cumulative Impacts Following this alternative would result in the maintenance of the last remaining fish migration barrier and navigation hazard in the upper Cedar Creek watershed. The Schweitzer dam would remain as the last of five dams which served as fish migration and navigation hazard along the upper 25 -miles of Cedar Creek, extending from the outlet of Little Cedar Lake (river mile 30) to the Cedarburg Pond dam in the city of Cedarburg (river mile 5). The thermal impact of this dam would remain. Fo ur dams would remain on Cedar Creek between Cedarburg's Cedarburg Pond dam (river mile 5) and Cedar Creek's confluence with the Milwaukee River (river mile 0). These structures would remain a barrier to fish migration and a navigation hazard.  4.3 Alternative C  Maintain Dam and Enhance Impoundment by Dredging 4.3.1 Biological Impacts Similar to Alternative B above, continued maintenance of the dam and impoundment would have a long -term series of negative environmental consequences. However, in the short -term some of the environmental consequences associated with the dam and resulting impoundment could be partially mitigated by dredging. Following this alternative, the dam structure would continue to be a complete and the last remaining barrier to fish passage in the upper Cedar Creek watershed. Fish populations would remain fragmented by the dam and the genetic health and diversity of fish species would remain compromised. The dam would maintain a warm pool of water dominated by heavy submerged plant growth and generally poor aquatic habitat quality. Water temperatures would still exceed the 22 0C MDM criteria for a cold water fish and aquatic life community. The potential to create a recreational trout fishery in Cedar Creek would not exist. Eurasian watermi lfoil would persist but perhaps at reduced levels provided dredging was sufficiently deep and absent continuing sedimentation, the benefits might be more than short -term. Carp would remain the dominant fishery. Both carp  24   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment and watermilfoil would proliferate and would remain a continuing source for downstream reaches. Overall habitat would remain conducive to fish and other aquatic life tolerant of degraded environmental conditions.  4.3.2 Habitat Impacts Although the impoundment habitat would remain limited, retain ing the impoundment would provide adequate depths to maintain a limited game fish population dominated by largemouth bass and some northern pike. Wildlife habitat currently served by the impoundment would be retained. However, there would be no opportuni ty to restore up to nine acres of wetland including expansion of a rare calcareous fen. Despite the increased depth of the pond from dredging, the resulting depth would not be sufficient to cause the pond to thermally stratify. Therefore there would not b e an opportunity to create cold water conditions downstream from a hypolimnetic bottom draw discharge from the dam. Despite any benefits that dredging might provide for water quality and habitat, the benefits would be temporary, as the pond would continue to settle material from upstream sources. While some habitat features would improve following the expected reduction in Eurasian watermilfoil growth, common carp would continue to dominate the fishery. Dredging the pond may actually exacerbate the existing watermilfoil infestation by fragmenting plants and causing them to take root. There exist potential impacts associated with the activity of dredging; dredge spoil transport and disposal. Hydraulic or mechanical dredging would result in the physical dis ruption of benthic habitat and re -suspension of sediment. The effects of re -suspended sediment could be mitigated through the use of turbidity barriers. The potential impacts of dredge spoil transport and disposal would depend on the dredging method, pro ximity of the disposal site, disposal site conditions and value, and the potential to manage or otherwise dispose of dredge spoil return water. Under this alternative, impacts to wildlife and their habitat would be very similar to those previously describe d in section 4.2.2 Habitat Impacts  No Action Alternative.  4.3.3 Cultural and Paleontological Resources There are no historical or archeologically significant properties in the project area (Appendix 5 and 6).  4.3.4 Listed, Proposed and Candidate Species There are no federal or state listed, proposed or candidate species located in the project area or that would otherwise be affected by this alternative. The state listed Special Concern species, the lake chubsucker, is resident to the Schweitzer impoundment. Maintenance of the dam and impoundment will not cause any long -term impact to this species. However, dredging operations would likely cause a short -term increase in the re-suspension of sediment, increased turbidity and a direct disruption of their associated benthic habitat. The ohio goldenrod and calcareous fen located adjacent to the impoundment should not be negatively impacted by maintaining the current dam and impoundment. As described previously for Alternatives A and B, groundwater was observed to be discharging from the fen well up gradient of the impoundment prior to and following the initial 2 -foot drawdown. Maintaining the dam and impoundment will not likely result in any natural expansion of the ohio goldenrod or calcareous fen community, nor woo uld this alternative be expected to cause the fen to be impacted by non -native invasive species. Potential impacts to the ohio goldenrod and calcareous fen might be reduced or eliminated by extending a ""no dredge"" zone adjacent to the fen.  25   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  4.3.5 Land Use and Land Value Selection of this alternative will not impact the current use of the impoundment or the surrounding land use and land values. The 9.75 -acre impoundment will be maintained. No new or enhanced wetlands would be created. This alternative would permit continued use of the remaining pond to operate the residential heat pump system. The maintenance and operation of the heat pump system does not negatively impact fish, aquatic life or wildlife populations or their habitat. The aesthetic qualities associa ted with the impoundment would remain. Recreational boating would be possible with small watercraft and might actually be enhanced in the short -term with the added depth and reduction in Eurasian watermilfoil. Following this alternative, the Department wo uld be required to maintain and operate the Schweitzer dam. One of the reasons the Department purchased these lands and infrastructure included the desire that the dam be removed, and the stream and lands restored to their historical biological use and va lues. In addition, the costs attendant to implementing this alternative would be a drain on existing Department resources. Dredging the pond may cost in excess of $1 million. This alternative would not require the construction of a replacement pond, an d as such, would not result in any additional costs to the Department or the residential heat pump owner. The activities proposed to occur under this alternative do not conflict with the plans, rules or policy of local or federal agency. However, maintenance of the existing dam and impoundment is not consistent with recommendations contained in two previously adopted state plans for managing the surface water resources of the Milwaukee River Basin (WDNR, 1990 and 1995). These plans recognize that dam remo val is a sound practice for restoring the environmental integrity of riverine systems. To date, 10 of the previous 52 dams located in the Milwaukee River Basin have been abandoned.  4.1.11 Risks and Unknowns (W EPA Component) There are no unknowns associated with this alternative. The negative environmental consequences of dams on riverine systems and management of small impoundments through dredging are well understood. The specific impacts attendant to the Schweitzer dam and impoundment have been described ear lier. Maintenance of the dam and impoundment would cause these impacts to persist indefinitely.  4.1.12 Precedent (W EPA Component) Consistent with WEPA requirements, this action is not precedent setting. Numerous dams are maintained and operated throughout the s tate for a variety of management reasons. The activities proposed to occur under this alternative do not conflict with the plans, rules or policy of local or federal agencies provided the dam structure is properly maintained. However, maintaining the dam is inconsistent with recommendations contained in two previously adopted state plans for managing the surface water resources of the Milwaukee River Basin (WDNR, 1990 and 1995). These plans recognize that dams have negative environmental impacts, and con versely, dam removal is a sound practice for restoring the environmental integrity of riverine systems.  4.3.6 Cumulative Impacts Following this alternative would result in the maintenance of the last remaining fish migration barrier and navigation hazard in the upper Cedar Creek watershed. The Schweitzer dam would remain as the last of five dams which served as fish migration and navigation hazard along the upper 25 -miles of Cedar Creek, extending from the outlet of Little Cedar Lake (river mile 30) to the Cedar burg Pond dam in the city of Cedarburg (river mile 5). The thermal impact of this dam would remain and may actually be enhanced as a result of the greater volume of the pond following dredging. Four dams would remain on Cedar Creek between Cedarburg's Cedarburg Pond dam (river mile 5) and Cedar Creek's confluence with the Milwaukee River (river mile 0). These structures would remain a barrier to fish migration and a navigation hazard.  26   Schweitzer Impoundment Final Environmental As sessment  4.4 Environmental Justice (Impact Common to All Alternatives) None of the alternatives will have a negative impact on the human environment. None of the alternatives will have a negative impact on a minority population or ethnic group. None of the alternatives will negatively impact the economically disadvantaged.  4.5 Summary of Environmental Consequences of Alternatives The following table briefly summarizes the environmental consequences of the alternatives carried forward for more detailed analysis:  Table 2: Comparison of Environmental Consequences of the Alternatives Condition/Alternative Alternative A (Proposed Action) Remove Dam, Restore Creek Channel and Create Off-Line Replacement Pond Removes last barrier to fish migration in upper reaches of Cedar Creek watershed.

A list of the media outlets provided a copy of the news release is contained in Appendix 8. The purpose of the news rel ease was to inform the public as to the intent of the project and to invite public input as to the scope of the EA. USFWS and Department contacts were included in the release. The release was sent via fax to a wide range of local and statewide public and private electronic and print media, in addition to interested organizations. A Fact Sheet describing the project was also made available upon request (Appendix 9). No formal written comments were received during the 30+ -day comment period. However, the Department did receive one voice mail message proposing that the dam be maintained and the pond dredged to increase water depth and improve fishing. In response, the Department evaluated this alternative as Alternative C  Maintain Dam and Enhance Impoundment by Dredging. The Department and the only other private landowner riparian to the project area have agreed to the responsibilities of each party regarding access and cooling pond replacement. The private landowner supports the dam removal Alternative A action. Letters were sent to the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and three Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPO). Letters were received back from the SHPO and one of three THPOs stating that there were no archeological or architectural significant properties located in the project area (Appendix 5 and 6). Two of the three letters sent to THPOs have not been returned during the 30 -day review period. As such, we assume these offices have not identified any significant archeological or architectural properties in the project area. Following review of the draft EA document by USFWS and Department staff, comments and revisions were incorporated as appropriate. The Department will apply for a dam abandonment permit and 30 -day Type 2 public notice and news release will be prepared. The EA was made available at a variety of local outlets including but not limited to local unit of governments and public libraries. Following the 30 -day review period, the Department and the USFWS reviewed the public comments and finalized the EA.  7 Public Comments on Draft EA and Agency Response The purpose of this section is to document and respond to public comments received during the draft EA public review period. The Service issued a public notice on Ju ly 30, 2002 http://midwest.fws.gov/News/Release0249.html. In addition, the Department issued a news release informing the public about the project and the opportunity to provide the Department and Service comments on the draft EA. A copy of the news release is provided as Appendix 10. The Department received one written comment on the draft EA during the 30 -day public review period that ended on August 6, 2002. A copy of the written comment is provided as Appendix 11. The individual generally supports the recommendation to remove the dam and restore the stream. However, they were concerned about the number of carp present in the Schweitzer impoundment and the negative impacts they might ha ve on Cedar Creek should they be released from the Schweitzer impoundment when the dam is removed. The author of the EA spoke with the individual on August 1, 2002 and informed them the Departments will attempt to capture as many as possible of the large b odied fish that will be released during demolition of the dam. The Department would make this commitment despite the fact that carp are already present in downstream reaches of Cedar Creek. A small mesh ""minnow"" seine will be set between the banks at the downstream side of the large scour pool formed below the dam spillway. The remaining water in the impoundment will be released slowly by making small notches in the dam weir.
