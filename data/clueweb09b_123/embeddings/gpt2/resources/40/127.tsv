Define emergency management, List the different levels of an emergency, Describe the role of the local OEM coordinator, State the difference between Comprehensive Emergency Management (CEM) and Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS), and Identify the different types of disasters.  SCOPE C C C C What is Emergency Management? The Role of the Coordinator-(defined) CEM & IEMS Types of Disasters  TEACHING METHODS - The instructor sets the stage by defining what emergency management is and the difference between an emergency and a disaster. The instructor describes the most important role of the coordinator -- obtaining resources, and knowing where to obtain the necessary manpower and equipment. The instructor then talks about Comprehensive Emergency Management and the Integrated Emergency Management System. The unit ends by identifying the different types of disasters.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -6REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   WHAT IS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT? INTRODUCTION Emergency Management is the discipline and profession of applying science, technology, planning and management to deal with extreme events that can injure or kill large numbers of people, do extensive damage to property, and disrupt community life. When these events occur and cause extensive harm, they are called disasters. The word disaster is widely used to describe everything from a flooded basement in New Jersey to the earthquakes in Los Angles, California. Emergency Management makes distinctions between emergencies and disasters. Emergencies are generally ""routine"" events that do not have a community wide impact or do not require the use of resources to bring conditions back to normal. When a community and its response agencies cannot operate within their own standard operating procedures (SOP's) or when they are required to seek additional resources, we move beyond the ""routine"" emergency level of operations. So what constitutes a disaster? A disaster depends largely on the community itself, and its size, resources, and experience in dealing with a certain hazard. It is important that each community develop different levels of progression from an emergency to a disaster. These levels are important in providing guidance to first responders, and even more important, guidance for local officials to make critical decisions that affect you as a citizen. Here are a few examples of emergency levels: Level 1 Any unexpected occurrence that can be met with a single department's available resources. The department that handles the occurrence is usually responsible for the decision making to resolve the incident. Any unexpected occurrence that requires response by two (2) or more city departments above routine capacity or where outside agencies have been requested to assist. The event requires a coordinated effort and commitment of personnel, equipment and resources from the responding departments. The department that handles the occurrence is usually responsible for the decision making process but a cooperative effort with the agencies responding is required. The Mayor is usually alerted about the situation. Any extraordinary occurrence of such magnitude that all departments and resources from the community must be used or where a combination of outside agencies and departments have been mobilized to handle the situation. Decision making is done by the OEM council. On-site commanders make those decisions to protect life and property. Decisions  Level 2 -  Level 3 -  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -7REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   mitigate and properly resolve the situation is the responsibility of the OEM council. This level usually results in a ""Declaration of Emergency"" by the mayor.  THE ROLE OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR The emergency management coordinator's role is to use and implement a variety of resources, techniques and skills to reduce the probability and impact of extreme events and to bring quick restoration to the community. Emergency management coordinators are ""key players"" in an emergency or disaster situation. THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE ""IN CHARGE"", BUT THEY SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE HAS ACCESS TO THE PROPER RESOURCES, skills, and knowledge necessary to manage the situation effectively. The most important aspect of an effective emergency management coordinator is making sure that the responsibility, authority, and channels of communication are clearly defined BEFORE the emergency happens. There are two (2) concepts that assist and define the roles and responsibilities the emergency management coordinator. They are comprehensive emergency management (CEM) and the integrated emergency management system (IEMS).  COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Comprehensive Emergency Management (CEM) is useful before and after a hazard strikes. Since World War II, emergency management has focused on preparing to respond to emergencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency adopted this approach for applying the Comprehensive Emergency Management System at the State and local levels. The concept is built on the principle that teamwork, coordination and cooperation among agencies and jurisdictions is essential. Being prepared is only one phase of Comprehensive Emergency Management. A community must also be able to deal with emergencies before they strike and have the ability to recover after a disaster. This is where the concepts of Comprehensive Emergency Management come into play. These concepts are mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Mitigation activities are those that eliminate or reduce the probability of a disaster occurrence. Also included are those long-term activities that lessen the undesirable  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -8REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   effects of unavoidable hazards. Some examples include the establishment of building codes, flood plain management, insurance, elevating buildings, and public education programs. Preparedness activities serve to develop the response capabilities needed in the event of an emergency. Planning, exercising, training and developing public information programs and warning systems are among the activities conducted under this phase. Response activities include direction and control, warning, evacuation and emergency services; and are designed to address immediate and short-term effects of the onset of an emergency or disaster. They help to reduce casualties and damage and to speed recovery. Recovery includes both short term and long term activities. Short term operations seek to restore critical services to the community and provide for the basic needs of the public. Long term recovery focuses on restoring the community to its normal, or improved state of affairs. The recovery period is also an opportune time to institute mitigation measures, particularly those related to the recent emergency. Examples of recovery actions would be temporary housing and food, restoration of non-vital government services, and reconstruction of damaged areas. These phases each have a direct relationship with each other. One phase results from the previous one and establishes the requirements of the next one. Activities in one phase may overlap those in the previous phase. For example; preparedness moves swiftly when a disaster strikes; and response yields to recovery at different times, depending on the extent and type of damage. Recovery should trigger mitigation, making attempts to prevent or reduce the potential of the next disaster.  INTEGRATED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS) is a way of settling out the details of Comprehensive Emergency Management (CEM). IEMS requires that a community conduct a hazard risk analysis, assess its current capabilities in the areas of mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, and devise action plans to close the gap between existing and required levels of capability. Implementing IEMS requires 1. 2. 3. A effective emergency organization, An active Emergency Program Manager, The development of a set of emergency management capabilities.  The larger emergencies associated with a catastrophic event will need special attention  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -9REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   and greater Federal involvement. Initial emphasis will be placed on basic emergency preparedness capabilities -- warning, direction and control, shelter, evacuation and the provision of food, health, medical resources at local levels. IEMS is designed to: 1. 2. 3. Foster a full Federal, State, and local government partnership with provisions of flexibility for achieving common goals. Implementation of Emergency Management measures which are effective. Build on the foundation of existing emergency management plans, systems and capabilities to broaden their applicability to the full spectrum of emergencies.  The community will begin by developing emergency operating plans that are governed by a national criteria specific enough to provide guidance, but general enough to allow flexibility for communities. The process begins with: 1. 2. 3. A comprehensive hazard assessment prepared by the community. Identifying the shortfalls of resources. Development of a generic operations plan with annexes for the unique aspects of individual emergencies, maintenance capability, mitigation activities, emergency operations, and policy and guidance and technical and financial assistance.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 10 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   TYPES OF DISASTERS Disasters are identified as natural, technological, and civil. Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados, or nor'easters that have an extreme impact on the community are NATURAL DISASTERS. Events that have a direct impact on the community but are caused by human omission or error are TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS. Deliberate human acts, such as riots or terrorist acts that cause harm are categorized as CIVIL DISASTERS. The North American continent is susceptible to numerous natural disasters every year. In New Jersey, a shoreline state, each year we focus on heavy rains, flooding, nor'easterns and hurricane threats. Flooding is the natural disaster from which we are most at risk. Although few injuries occur from floods, more deaths and property damage can be attributed to flooding than any other natural disaster. Here are some recent examples of how flooding affected the residents in New Jersey and the cost dollar figures of damages sustained.  NATURAL DISASTERS FLASH FLOODS - #1 Weather-related Killer in the United States! HOW DO FLASH FLOODS OCCUR? Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play an important role. Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. Rapidly rising water can reach heights of 30 feet or more. Furthermore, flash flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming. Most flood deaths are due to flash floods. Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical storms. Occasionally, floating debris or ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and restrict the flow of water. Water held back by the ice jam or debris dam can cause flooding upstream. Subsequent flash flooding can occur downstream if the  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 11 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   obstruction should suddenly release. June 9, 1972 - Black Hills, Rapid City, Sd, 15 inches of rain in 5 hours, 238 fatalities, $164M in damages - Source: National Weather Service Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet, and a depth of 2 feet will float your car! NEVER try to walk, swim, or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters, STOP! TURN AROUND AND GO ANOTHER WAY.

Flash flooding occurs within 6 hours of the rain event. Flooding is a longer term event and may last a week or more. River Flood - Flooding along rivers is a natural and inevitable part of life. Some floods occur seasonally when winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, fill river  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 13 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   basins, with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding. Coastal Flood - Winds generated from tropical storms and hurricanes or intense offshore low pressure systems can drive ocean water inland and cause significant flooding. Escape routes can be cut off and blocked by high water. Coastal flooding can also be produced by sea waves called tsunamis, sometimes referred to as tidal waves. These waves are produced by earthquakes or volcanic activity. Urban Flood - As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization increases runoff 2 to 6 times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements can become death traps as they fill with water. FLASH FLOODING IN ARROYOS/WASHES An arroyo is a water-carved gully or normally dry creek bed. Arroyos can fill with fastmoving water very quickly. Flash flooding at this arroyo in Arizona took only 58 seconds to develop. Ice Jam - Floating ice can accumulate at a natural or manmade obstruction and stop the flow of water. HOW CAN A FOOT OR TWO OF WATER COST YOU YOUR LIFE? Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 miles an hour. When a vehicle stalls in the water, the water's momentum is transferred to the car. For each foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are applied to the car. But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up the side of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect, the car weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises. Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles. WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY CAN DO: Assist hospitals and other operations which are critically affected by power failure by arranging for auxiliary power supplies. River/rainfall readings are valuable to local emergency management agencies (EMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) in assessing flood conditions and taking appropriate actions. WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 14 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   Advanced warning provided by early detection is critical to saving lives. Automatic flood detection systems are available commercially for flood-prone communities. Contact your local NWS office or emergency management agency for further information on Local flood warning systems. NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued. WHAT TO LISTEN FOR. . . Flash flood or flood watch: Flash flooding or flooding is possible within the designated watch area - be alert. Flash flood or flood warning: Flash flooding or flooding has been reported or is imminent - take necessary precautions at once. Urban and small stream advisory: Flooding of small streams, streets, and low-lying areas, such as railroad underpasses and urban storm drains, is occurring. Flash flood or flood statement:: Follow-up information regarding a flash flood/flood event. INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC ... C C C C Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots, canyons, washes, etc. Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt to cross flowing streams. If driving, be aware that the road bed may not be intact under flood waters. Turn around and go another way. NEVER drive through flooded roadways! If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep them away. Remember, it's better to be wet than dead!  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 15 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   C C  Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly during threatening conditions.  DURING THE FLOOD: C C C Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding. If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles, STOP! Turn around and go another way. Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water is not always obvious. The road bed may be washed out under the water, and you could be stranded or trapped. Children should never play around high water, storm drains, viaducts, or arroyos.  C  AFTER THE FLOOD: C C C C C C C If fresh food has come in contact with flood waters, throw it out. Boil drinking water before using. Wells should be pumped out and the water tested for purity before drinking. If in doubt, call you local public health authority. Seek necessary medical care at the nearest hospital. Food, clothing, shelter, and first aid are available from the Red Cross. Do not visit disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and other emergency operations. Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to service. Use flashlights, not lanterns, torches or matches, to examine buildings. Flammable materials may be inside. Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.  FAMILY DISASTER PLAN Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan. Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere - at work, at WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 16 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services - water, gas, electricity or telephones - were cut off? A DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT SHOULD INCLUDE: 1. 2. 3. 4. A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that won't spoil One change of clothing and footwear per person One blanket or sleeping bag per person, a first aid kit, including prescription medicines Emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and a portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash.  THUNDERSTORMS Thunderstorms affect relatively small areas when compared with hurricanes and winter storms. The typical thunderstorm is 15 miles in diameter and lasts an average of 30 minutes. Nearly 1,800 thunderstorms are occurring at any moment around the world. That's 16 million a year! Despite their small size, all thunderstorms are dangerous. Every thunderstorm produces lightning, which kills more people each year than tornadoes. Heavy rain from thunderstorms can lead to flash flooding. Strong winds, hail, and tornadoes are also dangers associated with some thunderstorms. Of the estimated 100,000 thunderstorms that occur each year in the United States, only about 10 percent are classified as severe. Your National Weather Service considers a thunderstorm severe if it produces hail at least 3/4-inch in diameter, wind 58 mph or higher, or tornadoes. Lightning C C C Occurs with all thunderstorms. Averages 93 deaths and 300 injuries each year. Causes several hundred million dollars in damage to property and forests annually. UNIT 1  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 17 REVISED 10/01   Flash Floods/Floods C C The number one thunderstorm killer. . . nearly 140 fatalities each year. Most flash flood deaths occur at night and when people become trapped in automobiles.  Straight-line Winds C C C C Responsible for most thunderstorm wind damage. Winds can exceed 100 mph! One type of straight-line wind, the down burst, can cause damage equivalent to a strong tornado and can be extremely dangerous to aviation. During the summer in the western states, thunderstorms often produce little rain but very strong wind gusts and dust storms.  Large Hail C C Causes nearly $1 billion in damage to property and crops annually. Costliest United States hailstorm: Denver, Colorado, July 11, 1990. Total damage was $625 million.  Tornadoes C C C C Nature's most violent storms. Winds can exceed 200 mph. Result in an average of 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries each year. Most fatalities occur when people do not leave mobile homes and automobiles.  WHAT MAKES A THUNDERSTORM? 1. 2. 3. Moisture - to form clouds and rain. Unstable Air - relatively warm air that can rise rapidly. Lift - fronts, sea breezes, and mountains are capable of lifting air to help form thunderstorms.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 18 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   WHEN ARE THUNDERSTORMS MOST LIKELY? C Thunderstorms are most likely to happen in the spring and summer months and during the afternoon and evening hours but can occur year-round and at all hours. Along the Gulf Coast and across the southeastern and western states, most thunderstorms occur during the afternoon. Thunderstorms frequently occur in the late afternoon and at night in the Plains states. Thunder and lightning occasionally accompany snow or freezing rain. During the blizzard of March 1993, lightning resulted in power outages near Washington, D.C.!  C C C  THUNDERSTORM WINDS AND HAIL Down bursts C C C C C A small area of rapidly descending air beneath a thunderstorm. Can cause damaging winds in excess of 100 mph. The strong winds usually approach from one direction and may be known as ""straight-line"" winds. In extreme cases, straight-line winds can reach speeds equal to a strong tornado, causing significant damage to some buildings. Strong winds may or may not be accompanied by rain.  Large Hail C C C The strong rising currents of air within a storm, droplets to a height where freezing occurs. called updrafts, carry water  Ice particles grow in size, finally becoming too heavy to be supported by the updraft and fall to the ground. Large hailstones fall at speeds faster than 100 mph.  WHAT IS LIGHTNING? WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 19 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   C  The action of rising and descending air within a thunderstorm separates positive and negative charges. Water and ice particles also affect the distribution of electrical charge. Lightning results from the buildup and discharge of electrical energy between positively and negatively charges areas. The average flash could light a 100-watt light bulb for more than 3 months. Most lightning occurs within the cloud or between the cloud and ground. Your chances of being struck by lightning are estimated to be 1 in 600,000 but could be reduced by following safety rules. Most lightning deaths and injuries occur when people are caught outdoors. Most lightning casualties occur in the summer months and during the afternoon and early evening. The air near a lightning strike is heated to 50,000 F-hotter than the surface of the sun! The rapid heating and cooling of air near the lightning channel causes a shock wave that results in thunder. Many fires in the western United States and Alaska are started by lightning. In the past decade, over 15,000 lightning-induced fires nationwide have resulted in several hundred million dollars a year in damage and the loss of 2 million acres of forest. In recent years, sophisticated lightning detection equipment has monitored cloudto-ground lightning strikes.  C C C C C  C  C  C C  WHICH WAY DOES LIGHTNING TRAVEL? A cloud-to-ground lightning strike begins as an invisible channel of electrically charged air moving from the cloud toward the ground. When one channel nears an object on the ground, a powerful surge of electricity from the ground moves upward to the cloud and produces the visible lightning strike! LIGHTNING MYTHS AND FACTS MYTH: If it is not raining, then there is no danger from lightning.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 20 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   FACT: Lightning often strikes outside of heavy rain and may occur as far as 10 miles away from any rainfall. MYTH: The rubber soles of shoes or rubber tires on a car will protect you from being struck by lightning. rubber tires provide no protection from lightning. frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased not touching metal. Although you may be injured if car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than  FACT: Rubber-soled shoes and However, the steel protection if you are lightning strikes your outside. MYTH:  People struck by lightning carry an electrical charge and should not be touched.  FACT: Lightning-strike victims carry no electrical charge and should be attended to immediately. MYTH: ""Heat lightning"" occurs after very hot summer days and poses not threat.  FACT: What is referred to as ""heat lightning"" is actually lightning from a thunderstorm too far away for thunder to be heard. However, the storm may be moving in your direction! To estimate the distance in miles between you and the lightning flash, count the seconds between the lightning and the thunder and divide by five. ADVANCED WEATHER RADAR SEES ""INSIDE"" THE STORM Doppler Radars, which are being strategically deployed around the country, are capable of seeing ""inside"" a thunderstorm to detect hazardous weather conditions. Doppler radar images can reflect wind direction, precipitation intensity, and the leading edge of the storm's cool-air outflow. (New storms often form along this feature.) NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios, which are stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery tone-alert feature that automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 21 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1  warnings and sold in many Your National backup and a issued.   C  Tells you when and where severe thunderstorms are more likely to occur. Watch the sky and stay tuned to know when warnings are issued. Watches are intended to heighten public awareness and should not be confused with warnings.  SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING C Issued when severe weather has been reported by spotters or indicated by radar. Warnings indicate imminent danger to life and property to those in the path of the storm.  FAMILY DISASTER PLAN Families should be prepared for all hazards that could affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge every family to develop a family disaster plan. Some questions to be considered? C C C C Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere-at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disaster may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services-water, gas, electricity or telephones-were cut off?  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 22 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   TORNADOS Although tornadoes occur in many parts of the world, these destructive forces of nature are found most frequently in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains during the spring and summer months. In an average year, 800 tornadoes are reported nationwide, resulting in 80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long. Once a tornado in Borken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas! WHAT CAUSES TORNADOES? Thunderstorms develop in warm, moist air in advance of eastward-moving cold fronts. These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. During the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop along a ""dryline,"" which separates very warm, moist air to the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours. Along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the ground flows ""up slope"" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore. TORNADO VARIATIONS Some tornadoes may form during the early stages of rapidly developing thunderstorms. This type of tornado is most common along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, and the Western States. Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up. Occasionally, two or more tornadoes may occur at the same time.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 23 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   Waterspout Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water. Waterspouts are most common along the Gulf Coast and southeastern states. In the western United States, they occur with cold late fall or late winter storms, during a time when you least expect tornado development. Waterspouts occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes causing damage and injuries. TORNADO MYTHS: MYTH: FACT: Areas near rivers, lakes, and mountains are safe from tornadoes. No place is safe from tornadoes. In the late 1980's, a tornado swept through Yellowstone National Park leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000 ft. mountain. The low pressure with a tornado causes buildings to ""explode"" as the tornado passes overhead. Violent winds and debris slamming into buildings cause most structural damage. Windows should be opened before a tornado approaches to equalize pressure and minimize damage. Opening windows allows damaging winds to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone; instead, immediately go to a safe place.  MYTH: FACT: MYTH: FACT:  Remember, tornadoes occasionally develop in areas in which a severe thunderstorm watch or warning is in effect. Remain alert to signs of an approaching tornado and seek shelter if threatening conditions exist. TORNADO SAFETY IN SCHOOLS C C C Every School Should Have A Plan. Develop a severe weather action plan and have frequent drills. Each school should be inspected and tornado shelter areas designated by a registered engineer or architect. Basements offer the best protection. Schools without basements should use interior rooms and hallways on the lowest floor and away from windows. Those responsible for activating the plan should monitor weather information from NOAA Weather Radio and local radio/television. UNIT 1  C  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 24 REVISED 10/01   C C C C  If the school's alarm system relies on electricity, have a compressed air horn or megaphone to activate the alarm in case of power failure. Make special provisions for disabled students and those in portable classrooms. Make sure someone knows how to turn off electricity and gas in the event the school is damaged. Keep children at school beyond regular hours if threatening weather is expected. Children are safer at school than in a bus or car. Students should not be sent home early if severe weather is approaching. Lunches or assemblies in large rooms should be delayed if severe weather is anticipated. Gymnasiums, cafeterias, and auditoriums offer no protection from tornado-strength winds. Move students quickly into interior rooms or hallways on the lowest floor. Have them assume the tornado protection positions.  C  C  Hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions should develop a similar plan Your National Weather Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and American Red Cross educate community officials and the public concerning the dangers posed by tornadoes. You can prepare for the possibility of a tornado by learning the safest places to seek shelter when at home, work, school, or outdoors. You should also understand basic weather terms and danger signs related to tornadoes. Your chances of staying safe during a tornado are greater if you have a plan for you and your family, and practice the plan frequently. HURRICANES HURRICANES are masses of warm moist air rotating around in a low pressure area. These masses develop seasonally over the Atlantic and Caribbean. When they reach speeds of seventy-four miles per hour, they are called hurricanes. Hurricanes can easily change course, subjecting coastal areas to a tidal or storm surge whose effects are much like those of a flash flood. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 inflicted more than seven billion dollars damage on South Carolina. There are no other storms like hurricanes on earth. Views of hurricanes from satellites located thousands of miles above the earth show how unique these powerful, tightly coiled weather systems are.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 25 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   Hurricanes are products of the tropical ocean and atmosphere. Powered by heat from the sea, they are steered by the easterly trade winds and the temperate westerlies as well as by their own ferocious energy. Around their core, winds grow with great velocity, generating violent seas. Moving ashore, they sweep the ocean inward while spawning tornadoes and producing torrential rains and floods. Each year on average, ten tropical storms (of which six become hurricanes) develop over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, or Gulf of Mexico. Many of these remain over the ocean. However, about five hurricanes strike the United States coastline every 3 years. Of these five, two will be major hurricanes (category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). WHAT IS A HURRICANE? A Hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone--the general term for all circulating weather systems (counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) over tropical waters. Tropical cyclones are classified as follows: TROPICAL DEPRESSION - An organized system of clouds and thunderstorms with a defined circulation and maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (33 knots) or less. TROPICAL STORM - An organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined circulation and maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph (34-63 knots). HURRICANE - An intense tropical weather system with a well defined circulation and maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher. In the western Pacific, hurricanes are called ""typhoons,"" and similar storms in the Indian Ocean are called ""cyclones."" Timely warnings have greatly diminished hurricane fatalities in the United States. In spite of this, Property damages continues to mount. There is little we can do about the hurricanes themselves. However, NOAA'S National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service field offices team up with other Federal, state, and local agencies; rescue and relief organizations; the private sector; and the news media in a warning and preparedness effort. In the eastern Pacific, hurricanes begin forming by mid-May, while in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, hurricane development starts in June. For the United States, the peak hurricane threat exists from mid-August to late October although the official hurricane season extends through November. Developing hurricanes gather heat and energy through contact with warm ocean waters. The addition of moisture by evaporation from the sea surface powers them like giant heat engines. The process by which a disturbance forms and subsequently strengthens into a hurricane depends on at least three conditions. 1. 2. Warm waters Moisture UNIT 1  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 26 REVISED 10/01   3.  Wind patterns near the ocean surface.  Bands of thunderstorms form, allowing the air to further warm and rise higher into the atmosphere. If the winds at these higher levels are relatively light, this structure can remain intact and allow for additional strengthening. The center, or eye, of a hurricane is relatively calm. The most violent activity takes place in the area immediately around the eye, called the eye wall. At the top of the eye wall most of the air is propelled outward, increasing the air's upward motion. Some of the air moves inward and sinks into the eye, creating a cloud-free area. WHAT IS STORM SURGE? Storm surge is a large dome of water often 50 to 100 miles wide that sweeps coastline near where a hurricane makes landfall. The surge of high water waves is devastating. The stronger the hurricane and shallower the offshore higher the surge will be. Along the coast, storm surge is the greatest threat property.

The storm tide is a combination of the storm surge and the normal astronomical tide. INFORMATION OR LOCAL DECISION MAKERS THE PUBLIC ADVISORY issued by the National Hurricane Center provides critical hurricane warning and forecast information. THE MARINE ADVISORY issued by the National Hurricane Center provides detailed hurricane track and wind field information. THE TROPICAL CYCLONE UPDATE issued by the National Hurricane Center provides significant changes in a hurricane that occur between advisories. PROBABILITIES OF HURRICANE/TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS provide a measure of the forecast track accuracy. The probabilities have no relation to tropical cyclone intensity. HURRICANE LOCAL STATEMENTS issued by the local national weather service offices give greater detail on how the storm will impact your area. TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS Technological disasters, which may or may not involve hazardous materials, usually occur with little or no warning. They also may be insidious, and the victims may not know they have been affected until many years later. Although there are many types of technological disasters, the most common involve fires and explosions. Other kinds of disasters are; transportation accidents, i.e., airplane crashes, structural failures, i.e., building collapses, and rail and highway hazardous materials incidents. In 1968, Congress established the National Contingency Plan (NCP), to help bring federal agency expertise on incidents involving spills of oil and hazardous substances. The two primary legal authorities for the NCP are the Clean Water Act, which establishes a fund for federal response to oil spills; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which established the Superfund for federal responses to release of hazardous materials. In 1984, after the Bhopal, India disaster in which a cloud of deadly methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a Union Carbide chemical plant, killing more than 25,000 people and leaving tens of thousands injured, Congress enacted legislation mandating disaster planning wherever hazardous materials are in use. THE SUPERFUND AMENDMENT AND REAUTHORIZTION ACT (SARA) is designed to assist localities and its citizens in preparing for and responding to hazardous WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 28 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   materials incidents. Title III of SARA, also known as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires detailed information about the nature of the hazardous substance in or near communities be made available to the public. CIVIL DISASTERS Civil disasters are civil disturbances, massacres, and other deliberately destructive human actions that impact our communities. The results that occur are usually widespread illnesses, injuries , destruction of property and long-term social and economic disruption. Terrorism is a civil incident with the potential to lead to civil disaster. Highly destructive weapons and political unrest have made terrorism of particular concern in the United States. Here are some examples of terrorist activities in the United States: The FBI has recorded one act of terrorism, one suspected act of terrorism, and two terrorism preventions on U.S. soil in 1995. Terrorism related events--including terrorism trials--occurred in eight states. The most significant terrorist-related events include the following: FEB 26,1993, A car bomb at the World Trade Center in New York City exploded, killing 6 people, injuring thousands and causing extensive damage. FEB. 28, 1995, (4) members of a domestic extremist group violating the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989. The subjects manufactured the biological agent RICIN with the intent to kill law enforcement officers. APRIL 19,1995, A truck bomb destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 citizens and injuring hundreds. It was the deadliest terrorist event on US soil. OCTOBER 9, 1995, A 12 car Amtrak train derailment in Arizona. The derailment killed one (1) person and seriously injured (12) others. Suspected act is still under investigation. NOVEMBER 11, 1995, FBI prevented an act of terrorism by arresting four US (4) persons in Oklahoma for illegally conspiring to manufacture and possess a destructive device. The subjects were considering attacking civil rights offices, abortion clinics, and federal offices.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 29 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1"

All six crewmembers abandoned the Scandia amid 10-foot waves and 25-knot winds; however, no one was injured. The crew was unsuccessful in its attempts to release the anchor of the barge, which ran aground and spilled 828,000 gallons of home heating oil, causing the largest pollution incident in Rhode Island's history, an incident that led to the closing of local fisheries. The safety issues discussed in this report are the origin of the fire, the company management's oversight of vessel maintenance, risk assessment of oil transportation by towed barges, search and rescue, and environmental pollution and cleanup. As a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard, Eklof Marine Corporation, and the American Waterways Operators, Inc.  The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent Federal agency dedicated to promoting aviation, railroad, highway, marine, pipeline, and hazardous materials safety. Established in 1967, the agency is mandated by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The Safety Board makes public its actions and decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and statistical reviews.

All six crewmembers abandoned the Scandia amid 10-foot waves and 25knot winds; however, no one was injured. The crew was unsuccessful in its attempts to release the anchor of the barge, which ran aground and spilled 828,000 gallons of home heating oil, causing the largest pollution incident in Rhode Island's history, an incident that led to the closing of local fisheries. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the fire damage aboard the tug Scandia and the subsequent grounding of and pollution from the barge North Cape was the Eklof Marine Corporation's inadequate oversight of maintenance and operations aboard those vessels, which permitted a fire of unknown origin to become catastrophic and eliminated any realistic possibility of arresting the subsequent drift and grounding of the barge. Contributing to the accident was the lack of adequate U.S. Coast Guard and industry standards addressing towing vessel safety. In its investigation, the Safety Board identified the following safety issues: 1. 2. 3. Origin and cause of fire. Company oversight of vessel maintenance. Risk assessment: Weather and voyage planning. Barge retrieval systems. Anchors on unmanned barges. Fire safety of towing vessels. 4. Search and rescue: Deployment of Coast Guard rescue boat. Hypothermia protective clothing. Decision to return to barge to drop its anchor. 5. Environmental pollution and cleanup.  As a result of its investigation of this accident, the Safety Board makes recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard, the Eklof Marine Corporation, and the American Waterways Operators, Inc.   this page intentionally left blank   1  Factual Information  The Accident Fire About 5:45 p.m. on Thursday, January 18, 1996, the tug Scandia departed Bayonne, New Jersey, en route to Providence, Rhode Island, through Long Island Sound. (See figure 1.) The Scandia was pushing an unmanned barge, the North Cape, that was loaded with 4,074,000 gallons of home heating oil. The tug had six crewmen on board: a captain, a mate, a chief engineer, two tankermen, and a dayman. After from pushing steel towing afternoon the the tug left New York Harbor and entered Long Island Sound, it switched to towing the North Cape. The tug towed it at 7.5 knots, using a 1,600-foot hawser. The captain stated that he expected to reach Providence by early following day.  About 1 1/2 hours after the departure, the captain requested and received a faxed weather forecast from FleetWeather Ocean Services, Inc., (FleetWeather).1 2 According to the forecast, when the Scandia reached Long Island Sound later that evening, it would face 3- to 6-foot seas and 15- to 25-knot winds, and it would face 4- to 8-foot seas in Block Island Sound the next day. Just before noon on Friday, according to the captain, the visibility began to diminish because of fog. The Scandia was nearing Watch Hill on the Rhode Island coast. At noon, according to the usual watchstanding schedule, the mate assumed the navigation watch from the captain. About the time the mate assumed the watch, the chief engineer engineroom watch and went to his cabin. He stated that nothing unusual during his 6-hour watch and that all equipment had functioned properly. p.m., the on-watch tankerman completed his brief, hourly walking engineroom3 and went to the pilothouse. He said he had found everything to the engineroom. finished his had occurred About 12:30 tour of the be in order in  1 2 3  See last page of this document for a list of all acronyms and abbreviations used in this report.  A commercial organization that provides weather forecasts on demand to subscribers. The forecast faxed to the Scandia spanned the period from Thursday, January 18, to Sunday, January 21. The main deck of the Scandia inside the engineroom was called the fidley deck; the engineroom space above it was called the fidley, and the space below was the lower engineroom, where the propulsion engine was located. The fidley deck consisted of a steel grating over the engine, surrounded by steel deck plating.   Factual Information 2  Figure 1. Route of the Scandia   Factual Information  3  About 1 p.m., while the tankerman remained on the bridge, the mate said he went to the galley, which was adjacent to the fidley, for a drink of water. He said he entered the fidley and looked down through the grating to the lower engineroom, because it was his normal practice to check the fidley and lower engineroom when he was near them. He noticed nothing unusual and returned to the wheelhouse. Approximately 1:20 p.m., the dayman4 was standing in the galley and saw smoke coming from the top of the closed door between the fidley and the galley. He ran to the wheelhouse and told the mate and the tankerman about the smoke. Meanwhile, the wheelhouse fire-alarm siren had activated, and the vessel monitoring system panel started indicating Fire in Upper Engineroom (fidley). The mate sounded the general fire alarm to alert the rest of the crew, and the on-watch tankerman ran from the wheelhouse to the accommodations and woke the captain, who immediately went to the wheelhouse and took command. According to the captain, the bridge equipment was functioning properly. He also stated that the weather was worsening and the seas were 8 to 10 feet. He said he had navigated the Scandia in similar seas and that the conditions were within the vessel's operating ability. The chief engineer said he awoke in his cabin at the sound of the general alarm and smelled smoke. He left his cabin, which adjoined the galley and fidley, and opened the fidley door. He said there were a number of small fires scattered on the grating, mainly on the center of the grating above the main engine, and that there were also some scattered fires on the port side of the grating. He stated that there was no fire in the lower engineroom. The dayman brought a portable carbon dioxide (CO2) fire extinguisher to the chief engineer, who sprayed the contents through the open fidley door on the fire. Both the dayman and the mate, who arrived in the galley soon after, stated that the fire was on the grating and that they did not see flames in the lower engineroom. The intensity of the heat and smoke prevented the chief engineer and dayman from entering the fidley. They discharged the contents of two more portable CO2 extinguishers on the fire but were unable to control it. The pull ring, or control, for the engineroom's semi-portable CO2 fire extinguisher system was inside the fidley, about 6 feet from the door. The chief engineer said that the heat and smoke prevented him from entering the fidley to reach the pull ring. He said he also could not reach the fire pump, which was in the lower engineroom. He said the intense heat and smoke made him feel helpless in fighting the fire because he did not have a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or a fireman's outfit. (Neither the Coast Guard nor the company required the Scandia to carry fireman's outfits or SCBAs.) The tankerman stated that the heat and thick smoke prevented him from closing the ventilation louvers on the engineroom stack (the louvers allowed air to enter the engineroom and feed the fire). The remote controls for the fans that ventilated the 4  The dayman's duties were cooking, cleaning, and helping moor the vessel.   Factual Information  4  engineroom were on the vessel's exterior, outside the fidley's aft door, near the towing winch drum; however, no crewmembers attempted to stop the fans. Meanwhile, a wooden cabinet fell over and blocked the fidley door to the galley. (The cabinet held engine spare parts and normally stood in the fidley against the forward port-side longitudinal bulkhead.) Consequently, the fidley door could not be closed, and smoke from the fidley entered the galley and flowed to other areas of the vessel. Because the rapidly increasing amount of smoke made breathing difficult, the captain told the mate to have the crewmembers retrieve their survival suits and muster on the bow. (The Scandia carried eight survival suits, and the cabins and watch locations were equipped with personal flotation devices.) About 1:57 p.m., the captain broadcast a PAN PAN5 on VHF radio channel 16 and told the Coast Guard Station Point Judith (the station) and Group Woods Hole that he had an uncontrolled fire on his vessel. (He also identified the Scandia's position from the vessel's global positioning system as latitude 41.18 N and longitude 71.32 W and described his location as being off No. 2 buoy, Point Judith.) He further informed the Coast Guard that there were six crewmen on board and that all intended to abandon ship. After making the broadcast, the captain donned his survival suit and went to the vessel's bow, where the rest of the crew had assembled. The crewmembers later said that while they waited on the bow, the tug's propulsion engine and the starboard generator, which powered the interior and exterior deck lighting, were still operating. Three commercial fishing vessels that were in the area, the Seafarer, the Huntress, and the Nautilus, had monitored the PAN PAN transmission. The Seafarer was closest to the Scandia. Its captain informed the Coast Guard that he was within 1.5 miles of the Scandia and proceeding toward it. About 2:02 p.m., a 41-foot utility boat (UTB) left the station. The station and the tug were about 4.5 miles apart. The boat's coxswain stated that before leaving he had not checked the latest weather information posted at the station but had observed the weather from the station window. After going a short distance, however, he realized that the wind and waves were too severe for the UTB. He returned to the station, and he and his crew transferred to a 44-foot motor life boat (MLB).6 About 2:23 p.m., the MLB left the station. About the same time, Group Woods Hole directed the 82-foot Coast Guard patrol boat Point Turner to proceed from Newport, Rhode Island, to the Scandia. Approximately 2:30 p.m., the Seafarer arrived on scene, and its captain radioed the Coast Guard that he could see six crewmen wearing survival suits and personal flotation devices on the bow of the tug, which was burning and smoking. The roughness of the sea prevented the Seafarer from approaching the tug without risking damage to its A radio broadcast indicating that the calling station has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a ship or person. The 41-foot UTB can operate safely in seas up to 8 feet and winds up to 30 knots; whereas the 44-foot MLB can operate safely in seas up to 30 feet and winds up to 50 knots. The UTB's maximum speed is 26 knots; the MLB's maximum speed is 13 knots. 6 5   Factual Information  5  extended outrigger arms. (The arms were extended over its sides to provide stability in rough seas.) About 2:55 p.m., the MLB arrived on scene. As the person in charge of the first Coast Guard resource to reach the scene, the coxswain assumed the role of on-scene commander.7 He observed that visibility was severely restricted by the thick fog and smoke. After the coxswain maneuvered the MLB in front of the tug, the chief engineer of the tug jumped onto the MLB. The pilothouse windows then suddenly blew out as if there had been an explosion. The coxswain said that when the ""explosion"" occurred and he saw flames come out of the pilothouse windows, he told the remaining crewmembers on the Scandia to hold hands and jump into the water. The coxswain then directed the surface swimmer on the MLB to jump in and retrieve the tug crewmembers. The swimmer was not wearing any thermal protection other than his anti-exposure coveralls. The temperature of the water was about 32 F. Wearing a rescue harness and tethered to the MLB, the swimmer encircled the crewmen in the water with his tether line and brought them alongside the MLB. The other MLB crewmen lifted them aboard. By 3:13 p.m., everyone had been retrieved from the water. While the MLB's crewmembers were assessing the physical condition of the tug crewmen, the captain of the Scandia asked the coxswain to take him to the barge so that he could board it and drop its anchor to prevent the barge from drifting ashore. But by then, the crew had discovered that the swimmer was hypothermic; consequently, the coxswain immediately returned to the station so the swimmer could have medical treatment. While the tug crewmen were being rescued, a Coast Guard helicopter had arrived and monitored the rescue. The coxswain later stated that given the rough sea, the poor visibility, and the smoke, the helicopter would not have been able to rescue the crew from the tug or hoist the swimmer from the MLB. At 3:35 p.m., the MLB arrived safely at the station. The swimmer was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated and released.  Attempt to Deploy North Cape's Anchor When they arrived at the station, the chief engineer and the mate of the Scandia asked the coxswain to return them to the barge so that they could drop its anchor. The As acted as reported salvage, 7  on-scene commander, he reported to the commander of Coast Guard Group Woods Hole, who the search and rescue (SAR) mission coordinator for this accident. The mission coordinator to the First Coast Guard District Office in Boston, Massachusetts. For SAR operations that involve the mission coordinator is required to obtain formal approval for salvage from the District.   Factual Information  6  coxswain and the officer in charge of the station discussed the request and conveyed the information to the group commander at Group Woods Hole. Meanwhile, Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod (the air station) told the group commander that the air station would not provide a helicopter to deliver anyone to the barge because the risk associated with dropping the barge's anchor did not meet the aviation risk assessment guidelines in the Coast Guard's Air Operations Manual.8 The Coast Guard's First District search and rescue (SAR) plan did not have similar restrictions or risk assessment guidelines for the group commander to use in evaluating the risks the mission posed to surface craft. The general Coast Guard salvage policy for the group commander did not specify the conditions under which Coast Guard and civilian personnel could be placed at risk for salvage operations. The group commander said that he decided to let the coxswain take the tug crewmen to the barge because he thought that the mission was reasonably likely to succeed. He stated that he based his decision on the following factors: the operator of the barge had assured him that the crew had the knowledge and experience to drop the anchor, the coxswain had agreed to deliver the crewmen to the barge, and the crewmen were confident that they could drop the anchor within 5 minutes of boarding the barge. The group commander did not include the air station in his decisionmaking process and did not tell the air station that he had authorized the coxswain to return to the scene. About 4 p.m., the coxswain and two other crewmen left the station in the MLB with the chief engineer and the mate of the Scandia, both of whom were wearing survival suits. The MLB reached the barge about 4:45 p.m., and the two tug crewmen boarded it at 4:56 p.m. The barge was still drifting toward the Rhode Island shore and was less than 2 miles offshore. The crewmen repeatedly attempted to release the anchor but failed. They stated that rain, fog, and smoke from the burning tug had reduced visibility and that waves breaking over the barge's deck made their task increasingly difficult and dangerous. The coxswain motioned to the crewmen to re-board the MLB when it became clear to him that the anchor could not be released; he said he feared that the MLB might capsize in the high surf as the vessels drifted into progressively shallower water. About 5:35 p.m., the chief engineer jumped from the barge to the MLB. The mate remained on the barge; he stated that he did not jump because he was afraid of landing on top of the chief engineer. The coxswain said that he did not tell the mate to escape by jumping into the water because the surf was so rough that the mate might have been swept away or run over by the MLB. The coxswain failed at several attempts to rescue the mate by 8  The guidelines prohibit a Coast Guard helicopter and crew from being placed at risk lives are in danger, the mission has a reasonable chance of success, and no other alternatives the guidelines state that risk of damage to an aircraft is not acceptable unless the value of the saved is greater than the cost of damage to the aircraft, and the aircraft is expected to be fully  unless human exist.

According to the coxswain, the surf was too rough for safe maneuvering, and the MLB was in danger of running aground. About 5:47 p.m., the coxswain radioed the station and asked that the air station dispatch a helicopter to rescue the mate. The coxswain then left, believing there was nothing more he could do without endangering his own crew. The barge grounded about 6 p.m. on the rocks of Nebraska Shoal, off Moonstone Beach, releasing about 828,000 gallons of oil. At 6:10 p.m., a second MLB was dispatched from Coast Guard Station Castle Hill in Newport, Rhode Island; it was to wait at the accident scene until the helicopter arrived. The MLB arrived on scene at 7:28 p.m. but could not get close to the grounded barge because of the dangerously high surf. At 7:11 p.m., the helicopter left the air station. (The pilot stated that because of the approaching storm he had been forced to wait more than an hour before taking off. He said that he had needed the time to check the weather, plan a safe flight route, and file an instrument flight rules flight plan with the Federal Aviation Administration. He was waiting for the front to come through and did not want to be on scene when it did.) At 7:54 p.m., the helicopter arrived on scene. The pilot said that the mate was holding on to an A-frame on the deck of the barge in order to keep himself from being washed overboard by the large waves that repeatedly crashed over the deck. The pilot lowered a rescue swimmer to the deck; the swimmer wrapped a belt around the mate, who was uninjured, and both men were safely hoisted to the helicopter. It departed the scene about 8:15 p.m. and arrived at Providence Airport at 8:50 p.m. About 8:30 p.m., the tug grounded. The towline between the two vessels was still intact.  Injuries The swimmer was treated for hypothermia and released. No one else was injured.  Damage The Scandia grounded on Moonstone Beach in South Kingston, Rhode Island. Nearly all of the tug's combustible interior, from the fidley grating upward through the galley, crew accommodations, and wheelhouse, was consumed by fire. The fire destroyed the navigation and communication systems and equipment. The damage to the tug was estimated to be $1.5 million. The grounding tore open 11 of the North Cape's 14 cargo tanks. Estimated structural damage to the barge was $3.6 million.   Factual Information  8  This accident resulted in Rhode Island's largest9 oil spill and severely affected the local fishing industry in the short term and threatened local beaches and the habitats of marine life and birds. Rhode Island's fishing industry employs about 35,000 people and generates about $500 million a year. Much of the catch of lobsters, crabs, and fish was embargoed by Health Department officials to keep oil-contaminated seafood away from consumers. The governor of Rhode Island declared a state of emergency so that Federal funding could be used to compensate fishermen and others whose businesses and livelihoods were affected by the oil spill. The Eklof Marine Corporation (EMC) hired salvage and environmental cleanup contractors to use deflection and oil-containment booms to help keep the oil away from pristine areas. The rough weather moved the booms from their intended locations and allowed oil to seep into environmentally sensitive ponds and fisheries. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed teams to study the effects of the oil on the fisheries and seabirds. According to NOAA's estimates, the oil killed millions of lobsters, harmed over a million pounds of shellfish, and affected thousands of pounds of fish in Block Island Sound and Rhode Island salt ponds. Thousands of seabirds and fish, such as flounder, tautog, and herring, washed ashore following the spill. Study teams estimated that it would take 1 to 5 years, depending on the species, for the affected fish and bird populations to return to the levels they had reached before the accident. Federal and State officials are using these studies to develop detailed plans for restoring the natural resources. NOAA used computers to calculate the trajectories of the oil and the effects of currents and weather on the dissipation of the oil. The calculations and field samples showed that within a week of the spill, the level of petroleum hydrocarbons in the water had fallen below the level considered toxic to shellfish and lobsters. NOAA estimated that the economic impact on human (public) use of the beachfront was minor. (Public use includes boat-based fishing, recreational diving, charter and party boat operations, beach use, and tourism.) However, the total scope of the environmental damage is still being assessed. Potential claims from the State of Rhode Island related to the natural resource damage are estimated to be $45 million.  Before this accident, the largest marine pollution incident in Rhode Island was the one that occurred in June 1989, in which the 560-foot-long tank ship World Prodigy ran aground on Brenton Reef, off Newport, spilling 200,000 gallons of home heating oil into Narragansett Bay. The spill was successfully cleaned up with minimal environmental damage. In comparison, the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in March 1989 in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilled about 10,836,000 gallons of oil, resulting in catastrophic damage to the environment.  9   Factual Information  9  Crew Information Crew Requirements Under 46 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 15.610, the captain of the Scandia had to be licensed by the Coast Guard and could not work more than 12 hours in a 24hour period. Because the Scandia operated round the clock, Coast Guard regulations required it to have a second licensed deck officer, a mate. When the Scandia was being operated but was not towing a barge, it did not have to carry a tankerman, a dayman, or a chief engineer. The North Cape was unmanned, and its certificate of inspection required two tankermen for loading and unloading the cargo. The entire Scandia crew met the Coast Guard's requirements for training and qualifications.  Captain The captain was licensed as a mate for coastal vessels under 500 gross tons with a radar observer endorsement; thus, his license exceeded the one he was required to have in order to operate towing vessels like the Scandia. He had completed the following CoastGuard-approved courses: basic and advanced firefighting (in October 1994) and survival at sea. His marine experience consisted of 14 years Company, where he had progressed from deckhand of the accident, the EMC had employed him for mo Scandia on several nonconsecutive occasions for a of the vessel since September 1995. with the McAllister Brothers Towing through mate to captain. At the time re than 7 years. He had served on the total of 2 years. He had been captain  On January 18, he said he slept for about 5 hours (12:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m.). He worked the 6-a.m.-to-noon shift, then took a nap before the fire started.  Mate The mate had a license for coastal vessels under 500 gross tons with a radar observer endorsement; he also had a tankerman's certificate. He stated that he had participated in drills aboard the Scandia. He had not taken any courses in firefighting or survival. He said he had worked in the marine industry for 17 years, starting on river towboats that pushed tank barges on the inland waterways. Then, he worked on offshore vessels in the oil industry in Louisiana, where he worked as tankerman, mate, chief mate, and captain.   Factual Information  10  The EMC had employed him for about 4 1/2 years. For the first year he had served as tankerman, the remaining time as mate on various EMC vessels. He had served as the mate of the Scandia since December 1994. On the day of the accident, he said he had slept for about 5 1/2 hours before he started his watch at noon.  Chief Engineer The chief engineer had a marine engineer's license for motor vessels of unlimited horsepower operating on limited oceans routes. He had 13 years of marine experience. He had been in the offshore supply-vessel industry as an oiler, assistant engineer, and chief engineer. Before joining the EMC, he had worked as chief engineer for 3 1/2 years on offshore supply vessels for Tidewater Marine. The EMC had hired him about 69 days before the accident, and he had spent the time as chief engineer of the Scandia. He said that he had participated in fire drills, and that ""we try to have a fire drill once every 2 weeks."" Coast Guard regulations require all licensed engineers, regardless of the vessel's gross tonnage or horsepower, to take firefighting training. The chief engineer had completed Coast-Guard-approved courses in basic and advanced firefighting about 4 years before the accident. He had been trained in using portable fire extinguishers, firefighting foam, fire hose teams, breathing apparatus, and fireman's outfits. He had also taken cold-water survival training while he was employed by a previous employer. Coast Guard regulations do not require uninspected towing vessels (UTVs)10 or unmanned barges to have a licensed engineer on board. The EMC had provided the engineer to operate the pumps on the barge when the cargo was being loaded or unloaded and to perform routine maintenance on the tug. The chief engineer was on watch from 6 p.m. until midnight on Thursday. That night he slept for about 5 hours, and then worked his 6-a.m.-to-noon shift in the engineroom on the day of the fire.  Dayman The dayman held a merchant mariner's document (MMD) endorsed as an ablebodied seaman (AB). He had obtained his maritime training over a 7-year period at the Naval Institute and Marine College, Russia. He had spent the next 7 years at sea, 5 as third mate and 2 as second mate, on Russian fishing trawlers. As a mate, he had attended a week-long firefighting school each year.  Towing vessels are uninspected, unless the vessel admeasures over 300 gross tons and is oceangoing. According to Coast Guard statistics, all but 10 of the 5,216 towing vessels in the United States are uninspected.  10   Factual Information  11  The EMC had hired him about 6 weeks before the accident, and his responsibilities included cooking and cleaning the galley and accommodations. He also helped moor the barge and tug. The accident trip was his first trip on the Scandia. He stated that when he boarded the tug, the captain told him what his duties were and how to use the survival suit. He stated that he did not know how to operate the semi-portable CO2 system that protected the engineroom. The dayman said he worked from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on the vessel on January 18 and then relaxed on board. He said that he went to bed that night at 11 p.m. and awoke at 7 a.m. on January 19.  Tankerman 1 The tankerman held an MMD endorsed as an AB. He had taken a course in loading and discharging tank vessels and had a tankerman rating. He stated that he had had no training in either firefighting or lifesaving. However, he correctly described to Safety Board investigators how to operate the CO2 system in the fidley. He said his last emergency drill on the Scandia was an abandon-ship drill, which was held about a month before the accident. He had worked as tankerman for 7 of the 10 years that he had worked in the marine industry. He had worked for the EMC as a tankerman for nearly 5 1/2 years and had served on the Scandia for about a year. Before joining the EMC, he had been employed by two other towing companies. He said he had slept about 5 1/2 hours (6 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.) before starting his shift at noon on the day of the accident.  Tankerman 2 The tankerman held an MMD endorsed as an AB and worked as the second tankerman, the steward, and the wiper on the Scandia. His 11 years in the marine industry included 9 as a tankerman and 2 as a deckhand. The EMC had employed him for over 4 years, and he had served on the Scandia for a little over a year. He had worked with the North Cape for about 4 years. He did not have firefighting training; none was required by regulations. He stated that he had last participated in a firefighting drill just over a month before the accident. The tankerman was on watch from 6 p.m. to midnight on January 18. After that, he said, he had slept for about 5 1/2 hours before starting his watch at 6 a.m.   Factual Information  12  Vessel Information Scandia The oceangoing towing vessel was 111.5 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 10.5 feet deep. It was operated by the EMC (see figures 2, 3, and 4). It was built in 1968 and admeasured 198 gross tons. It was documented by the Coast Guard to operate on coastwise and foreign voyages. Engineroom. The main deck of the Scandia continued inside the engineroom, where it was called the ""fidley deck""; the space above the deck was called the ""fidley,"" and the space below was called the ""lower engineroom."" The Scandia's 3,600-horsepower propulsion diesel engine was situated longitudinally on the tug's centerline in the lower engineroom. The engine's exhaust manifold pipe, 10 inches in diameter and thermally insulated, ran on top of the engine, 7 inches below the fidley deck grating. The temperature of the manifold, under the insulation blanket, was about 950o F under normal operating conditions. An exhaust gas turbocharger was attached to the aft end of the engine's exhaust manifold; the turbocharger was about 15 feet aft of the center of the fidley deck grating and just below it. The aft end of the turbocharger connected to a rubber pipe that formed a vibration connection to the plenum that drew fresh outside air into the engine. The company's port engineer estimated that the fidley deck grating was about 135o F under normal operating conditions. The holes in the fidley deck grating allowed air to move up from the lower engineroom to the fidley, where an exhaust fan in the stack vented the air to the outside. Two ventilation fans drew outside air into the lower engineroom. Two diesel generators, one on each side of the main engine, provided the vessel's electrical power. An oil-fired boiler (for hot water and heat) was in the aft starboard corner. All fuel and lube oil system components for the Scandia, including tanks, piping, valves, pumps, motors, and controls, were in the lower engineroom. The forward end of the lower engineroom had a workshop, including a wooden worktable. The Scandia's fire pump was in the lower engineroom; the pump was operated by the engine for the starboard generator via a power take-off clutch. To operate the pump, a crewmember had to come down from the fidley, using either the port or starboard stairway, open sea water valves to the pump, and engage the clutch. The pump could not be started from outside the engineroom. Fidley.

The cabinets contained machinery spare parts and were attached to the bulkhead. The vessel's electrical distribution systems, switchboards, and transformers were in the fidley. A watertight steel door at the aft end of the fidley led to the exterior of the main deck aft, where the winch for towing barges was. Emergency remote controls for shutting off fuel pumps to the propulsion and generator engines were on a bulkhead just outside the fidley's aft door, along with remote controls for closing the valves from the fuel tanks. Also located here were the control switches for the engineroom ventilation supply fans and exhaust fans. Crew Accommodations.

Above the the captain and the mate. The accommodations were made of  The Scandia was a UTV. UTVs are required to comply with regulations at 46 CFR Subchapter C, Part 25, which the Scandia did. These regulations required the Scandia to have at least three 15-pound portable fire extinguishers, lifesaving equipment, emergency position indicating radar beacons, and engineroom ventilation systems. In addition to meeting these requirements, the Scandia also had a semi-portable CO2 fire extinguishing system, additional portable fire extinguishers, a fire pump, and remote closing devices for fuel pumps, valves, and ventilation fans. (The regulations do not require vessels such as the Scandia to have remotely operated fixed fire extinguishing systems in the engineroom, remotely operated fire pumps, SCBAs, or firesuits. The Scandia was not equipped with these items.) The Coast Guard does not require UTVs to be classed by ship classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). However, the EMC kept the Scandia in ABS class as Towing Vessel for Ocean Service. ABS surveyors carried out annual hull and machinery surveys11 and dry dockings at 24- to 30-month intervals. Safety Board investigators reviewed the ABS survey records from January 1992 to April 1995, when the last survey before the fire was done. The ABS reported the overall condition of the Scandia to be satisfactory12 during this period. As a condition of maintaining ABS class, the ABS requires the vessel owner or operator to tell ABS Surveys are visual and operational examinations of selected mechanical and electrical equipment and systems and include the visual and ultrasonic examination of the hull plating and structure. In ABS survey reports, a vessel condition (machinery, electrical, material) is noted as ""Satisfactory"" or ""Un-satisfactory."" This comment is used to indicate whether the equipment met or failed to meet the operational or material requirements in an ABS survey. 12 11   Factual Information  17  surveyors about any significant problems on a vessel that may affect its classification. The EMC did not report any such problems to the ABS during this period. According to the ABS, machinery classification surveys are typically conducted with the vessel in port, when the main engine is not running. According to ABS rules, a survey is a spot check of a vessel's condition at a point in time and is not intended to provide a continuous evaluation of the vessel, and the ABS is not responsible for the maintenance of the vessel. North Cape The single-hulled barge North Cape was 340 feet long, 70 feet wide, and 27.8 feet deep. It was built in 1978 and admeasured 5,506 gross tons. The North Cape had a centerline longitudinal bulkhead and transverse bulkheads that divided the cargo block into seven pairs of port and starboard tanks; the vessel's total cargo capacity was 4.2 million gallons (100,000 barrels). For loading and unloading the cargo, the barge had a cargo pumproom on the deck forward and two pumprooms on deck aft. The Coast Guard had issued a certificate of inspection for the North Cape for unmanned operation on coastwise and ocean routes and for the carriage of Grade A and lower grades of oil. The North Cape was also classed with the ABS as an oil barge. The Coast Guard does not require unmanned barges to have anchors and windlasses, as no crewmembers are normally on board to operate them. (Manned barges are required to have anchors.) Nor does the ABS require such equipment as a condition of classification. The North Cape, however, had a 6,000-pound bow anchor. On the day of the accident, it was temporarily held in place on the bow anchor sled by a wire rope sling and shackle attached to an A-frame just behind the sled. The temporary arrangement was used while the windlass and its brake--which normally secured the anchor--were being repaired ashore. The North Cape was equipped with the anchor and windlass for operational convenience, according to the EMC; the vessel's logbook showed that it had often anchored while waiting for access to an oil terminal or for traffic to clear in a congested waterway. The mate stated that he had secured the anchor in the temporary fashion just before starting the trip and that the anchor had been similarly secured before when the windlass was being repaired.  Company Information The Scandia and the North Cape were operated by the EMC, Staten Island, New York. The EMC operated 42 vessels, including 22 tank barges, 12 tugs, 2 integrated tug/barges, and 6 tank ships. The vessels operated along the East Coast, on the inland waterways, in the Gulf of Mexico, and on Central and South American waters. The company had about 50 employees on shore and 225 employees on vessels.   Factual Information  18  The EMC's management consisted of a president, a vice president, an operations (and safety) manager, a port captain, and three port engineers. The EMC's 10-acre Staten Island facility included a full marine repair yard that consisted of a machine shop, an electric shop, a welding shop, and a safety and training building. The EMC did most of its vessel repairs in its yard using EMC personnel. (In February 1998, the president of the EMC told the Safety Board that the EMC had changed its corporate policy after this accident, when the EMC began contracting for all repair work.)  EMC's Vessel Maintenance Program In January 1996, the EMC gave the Safety Board investigators its Operation Notice 17-93, which briefly described the way in which the company's vessel inspection program (VIP) was intended to function. According to the document, the program was administered by the EMC's operations manager and was aimed at detecting and correcting unsafe shipboard conditions and practices which, if left undetected, could lead to accidents. The VIP required captains to inspect their vessels once a month, to ensure that their crews completed the repairs and maintenance within their capability, and to complete monthly discrepancy reports for their vessels and forward them to the operations department. The operations department was responsible for reviewing the discrepancy reports and for correcting problems, by directing either company repair personnel or subcontractors to do repairs at the EMC's repair yard. According to Operation Notice 17-93, serious safety discrepancies were to be corrected within about 2 weeks.  Maintenance of Scandia The Safety Board reviewed the Scandia's discrepancy reports for 1994 and 1995. One particular discrepancy was reported by captains as many as nine times between May 1994 and July 1995 and was characterized by them as a ""fire hazard."" The problem was described in a handwritten attachment to the June 1995 discrepancy report: The turbocharger is leaking oil in a bad way, it was looked at when we was in the yard for fire repairs,13 but nothing was done to it to correct the problem. The smoke is so bad that if we don't open the watertight door at the rear of the engineroom, the smoke forces the smoke in the galley and the rest of the tug. Oil comes out of the turbo and soaks the blanket and down on top of the engine and burns off. I've had complaints of headaches from the crew, irritated and sickening smell, all watertight doors should be closed underway, the amount of smoke coming out of the back door of the engineroom is always pointed out by other tugs as we pass them like there is a real problem in the engineroom. Chief [engineer] says it has flashed The writer is referring to the engineroom fire on March 1995, which is described in this section of the report. 13   Factual Information  19  and caught fire once before, He put it out with a CO2 extinguisher.... [footnote added] In addition to the turbocharger oil leak, the reports also mentioned a leak in the main engine exhaust system as another source of the smoke in the engineroom. Some other safety discrepancies reported by vessel masters are noted below:  The July 1995 report stated that the casing for the main fire pump was rusted through (""quarter-size holes"") and that the backup bilge pump was being used instead. The December 1995 report stated that the captain had to shut down the boiler ""due to fire hazard."" The November 1995 report stated that the ""fire hose threads do not match tug piping."" The September and October 1995 reports stated that ""the captain's room leaks water when raining. A lot of water!!! Floods!!!"" All reports from January to December 1995 stated that ""magnetic compass needs calibrating."" Eleven reports requested the replacement of safety guards on the air compressor belt. Six monthly reports requested safety guards for couplings on the steering gear pumps. Five reports from 1994 stated that both emergency escape hatches were sealed and inoperable. Five reports stated that hydraulic oil was leaking from steering gear valves.           The EMC's maintenance personnel could not provide documentation or details about when or whether the above discrepancies had been corrected. In February 1998, Safety Board investigators again interviewed the EMC operations manager, who administered the VIP, and the operations department supervisors responsible for reviewing and taking corrective action about discrepancy reports to determine why no action had been taken for long periods on the discrepancy reports. Their testimony is summarized below:  The company did not have a policy of keeping a record of repairs and did not have any record of repairs on the Scandia. (The EMC gave the Safety Board receipts for some repairs that subcontractors had done on the Scandia.) When Safety Board investigators showed the operations supervisors the discrepancy   Factual Information  20  reports, the supervisors could not recall any specifics about whether the problems mentioned in the reports had been corrected.  After the discrepancy reports were acknowledged that it often took no action were not communicated to maintenance maintenance system suffered from a lack departments in the EMC organization. reviewed, the operations staff and that vessel maintenance needs personnel. The staff said that the of communication among various     The EMC did not have a system of maintenance oversight to monitor whether repairs were properly conducted. An operations supervisor who reviewed the reports on the turbocharger oil leak and smoke explained that he did not take action because he did not have the technical knowledge to tell the difference between major and minor problems. Another operations supervisor responsible for reviewing the reports suggested that some captains exaggerated problems on their discrepancy reports, so he ignored the reports. The employment of two of the captains who had filed the discrepancy reports had been terminated around the time the accident occurred.    The captain of the Scandia asked Safety Board investigators to refer to the discrepancy reports to evaluate the maintenance of the Scandia.  Company Training and Drills Company representatives stated that the EMC's vessel crews received on-site training in drug and alcohol awareness, benzene handling, and tank barge vapor-recovery systems. Employees were also trained at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, New York, in survival at sea and in vapor-recovery systems. The company did not, and was not required to, train its employees at marine firefighting school. The captain said week stints on the tug. donning survival suits, Sunday, around noon at sleeping periods. that he tried to hold one emergency drill during each of his 2(The drills covered firefighting, dealing with a man overboard, and abandoning ship.) He said he usually held the drill on a the change of the watch, so as not to interfere with the crew's  He said that during fire drills, the crew laid out the hose from a fire hydrant, while the chief engineer activated the fire pump and provided pressurized water to the fire hydrants and the hose on deck. Tankerman 1 stated that firefighting drills on the Scandia involved the chief engineer starting the fire pump and the tankerman running the fire hose down an exterior side of the boat to extinguish an imaginary fire. He added that the drill was followed by a discussion of the firefighting scenario and that the participants   Factual Information  21  discussed each crewmember's duties and station during a fire. Tankerman 2 stated that drills were held every 4 to 6 weeks in summer. The captain said it was company policy to conduct drills; however, the EMC could not provide records of the drills. Coast Guard regulations do not require drills.  Fire Damage Safety Board investigators examined the damage on the Scandia and found no fire or smoke damage below the fidley grating, while the vessel was completely gutted above it. Investigators found evidence of severe fire damage near the center of the grating, which was directly above the main engine exhaust manifold. All the plastic switches, wooden workbenches, and various other combustible materials below the grating were unaffected by fire. There was no evidence of fires or leaks from the fuel or lube oil systems in the lower engineroom, where those systems and the Scandia's machinery were located. There was no evidence of a crankcase fire or explosion on the propulsion or generator engines. The metal casing of the exhaust gas turbocharger did not have any flame damage; the paint on the casing showed moderate discoloration from the effects of heat. (The turbocharger was about 15 feet aft of the center of the grating and just below it, and attached to the aft end of the engine's exhaust manifold pipe.) The rubber vibration pipe connection between the turbocharger and the air intake plenum was intact, but its upper exterior surface was moderately burned. From the grating upward, the engineroom was completely gutted by fire. All combustible insulation on the interior bulkheads, the overheads, and the wooden cabinets had been consumed. All electrical equipment in the fidley, including the main switchboard, circuit breakers, cables, and transformers, had been destroyed. Fire had destroyed the combustible contents of the vessel from the main deck up to the pilothouse, including the galley/dining area, the crew accommodations, and the stairway. The sheathings on all bulkheads and overheads, made of marinite and varnished wood, as well as mattresses, furnishings, and clothing, had been destroyed. Only the exterior steel of the superstructure remained. Near the grating, investigators observed the following:  The grating had been deformed by the heat of the fire and sagged down about 2 inches toward the exhaust manifold, where a section of the manifold's thermal insulation blanket had come loose. The protected glass globe of a light fixture, about 8 feet above the grating, had melted and sagged downward toward the exhaust manifold before solidifying.     Factual Information  22     Of two lifting I-beams in the fidley overhead, the port beam was warped from heat in a location above the sagging section of the deck grating. Black trickle marks of a solidified substance were found on the loosened insulation, as well as on the top and sides of the main engine. (Core Laboratories, Houston, Texas, could not positively identify samples of the substance sent to them by Safety Board investigators for analysis because the samples were contaminated with the barge's cargo oil when the Scandia ran aground and its engineroom flooded.) On the exterior of the vessel, the ventilation louvers on the port side of the stack showed heat damage, while the paint around the starboard louvers showed little heat damage.    On March 5, 1995, while the Scandia was moored at the Northeast Oil Terminal in New Haven, Connecticut, it had a fire in its engineroom. The fire was caused by a malfunction in the vessel's oil-fired hot-water heating system, which was in the aft starboard corner of the lower engineroom. The lower engineroom was significantly damaged, and extensive repairs were done at the EMC's repair facility later that month. After the repairs were completed, the Scandia was surveyed to the satisfaction of the ABS and continued operations. Safety Board investigators examined the hot-water boiler after the 1996 fire and found no recent fire damage. During the 1995 fire, the Scandia's crew fought the fire until firefighters from the local fire department arrived. According to a handwritten statement attached to the March discrepancy report, two crewmen borrowed breathing apparatus from the fire department firefighters and put out the fire. Afterward, the captain recommended that the EMC equip the Scandia with two sets of firesuits and SCBAs, so that the crew could effectively fight fires in the future. The EMC did not comply.  Waterway Information Long Island Sound is a deep navigable waterway connecting New York Harbor in the west to Block Island Sound, Rhode Island, on the east (see figure 1). Long Island Sound is about 110 miles long and 10 to 25 miles wide, and the waters are well marked with navigation aids. Marine traffic is sheltered from ocean storms and strong southerly winds by remaining in the lee of Long Island when transiting the sound. After leaving Long Island Sound, vessels proceed through the ""Race,"" which serves as a ""gateway"" to the next sound--Block Island Sound. Vessels are exposed to high southerly winds, waves, and ocean swells while in the Race because it does not have any islands to provide protective land cover. The Scandia had passed through the Race and by Watch Hill when the fire was reported. Block Island Sound is bounded by Rhode Island to the north and by Block Island to the south. The Atlantic Ocean lies east and south.   Factual Information  23  The coast of Rhode Island is lined with federally protected salt water ponds extending from Narragansett to Westerly, Rhode Island. The ponds are breeding grounds for fish and shellfish, and they are a refuge for waterfowl migrating along the Atlantic seaboard. At high tide, the sea breaches most of the ponds. The North Cape grounded about midway along a string of eight federally protected salt water ponds. The Scandia grounded near Trustom Pond, the centerpiece of a national wildlife preserve.  Meteorological Information At 7:20 p.m. on January 18, FleetWeather faxed the following forecast to the captain: January 18, evening, New York Harbor (departure of the Scandia): Winds out of the east-southeast at 15 to 25 knots, becoming south-southeasterly and increasing to 30 to 38 knots, with clouds, fog, and a chance of showers. January 19, early morning, Long Island Sound (planned transit of the Scandia): Southerly winds increasing to 35 to 45 knots. Seas 3 to 7 feet. January 19, between Watch Hill and Chatham, Massachusetts (Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds; planned transit of the Scandia): Southerly winds increasing to 35 to 45 knots a.m.; becoming westerly at 20 to 28 knots by late p.m., with rain, and seas of 4 to 8 feet. Much higher seas on waters exposed to south this p.m. (January 18) through January 19. The captain did not obtain further weather updates from FleetWeather on the day of the fire, nor did the EMC give him updates. When asked whether he had received weather updates, the captain did not tell Safety Board investigators in January 1996 that he had heard storm warnings on the tug's radio. Safety Board staff again interviewed him in February 1998 (see appendix), when he told investigators that he had been aware of the storm from radio broadcasts, but he did not provide details of when or what he heard. The Coast Guard routinely receives weather information from the National Weather Service (NWS) and makes urgent weather broadcasts, called safety marine information broadcasts (SMIBs), to warn mariners in case severe weather is forecast. Group Woods Hole broadcast a storm warning (SMIB) at 11:09 p.m. on January 18 and again on January 19 at 7:52 a.m., 12:26 p.m., and 2:26 p.m. The broadcasts were storm warnings14 for the region from Chatham to Watch Hill. (The Scandia had passed Watch Hill about an hour before it caught fire). For January 19, the SMIB forecast southerly winds from 25 to 35 knots during the day, increasing to 40 to 50 knots late in the day, and 10- to 20-foot seas. It also forecast rain, drizzle, and fog. For that night it forecast 14  According to the NWS, storm warnings are issued when winds of 48 knots or more are forecast.   Factual Information  24  southwest winds at 40 to 50 knots, diminishing later to 25 to 35 knots, and seas between 10 and 20 feet. A January 19 news release from the Coast Guard District Office warned mariners from Maine to New Jersey of a fast moving storm that could severely affect the area: A period of potentially dangerous winds from 40-50 knots with higher gusts is expected late today (19th Jan Friday) and tonight. Seas from 15 to 25 feet and minor coastal flooding are also expected.... Mariners are strongly reminded to closely monitor weather and Coast Guard emergency radio frequencies and seek safe shelter if needed. In addition to information about weather forecasts, Safety Board investigators obtained information regarding actual on-scene weather conditions from several other sources. A SAR message from Coast Guard Group Woods Hole described the on-scene weather at the time of the accident (2 p.m.) as southerly winds at 25 knots and seas between 6 and 8 feet. Also, the fishing vessel Seafarer, which was a mile away, was the first vessel to arrive on scene at 2:30 p.m.; its operation was not hampered by the weather. The fishing vessels Nautilus and Huntress were also operating in the area at that time. A situation report (SITREP) from the air station indicated that the on-scene weather was estimated at 10- to 12-foot seas and winds of 26 knots gusting to 36 knots, about 3 p.m., when the Coast Guard helicopter was providing air cover while the MLB crewmen rescued the crewmembers from the tug. At 4:30 p.m., the Coast Guard cutter Point Turner reported seas of 25 to 30 feet near the accident site.15 According to a SITREP from Group Woods Hole, the on-scene weather had deteriorated to 20- to 30-foot seas and winds in excess of 50 knots by about 5 p.m., when the Coast Guard MLB with two tug crewmen reached the barge to try to release its anchor.  Toxicological Information Coast Guard postaccident drug and alcohol testing regulations (46 CFR) require that specimens be collected ""as soon as practicable following an accident."" At approximately 10:30 p.m. on the day of the accident, the Coast Guard tested each member of the Scandia's crew with a breathalyzer for the presence of alcohol. All the results were negative.  The Point Turner was forced to abort its mission to assist the Scandia when sea action broke the attachments for the ship's refrigerated stores container.  15   Factual Information  25  Urine samples were collected to test for the presence of drugs16 about 5 a.m. the day after the accident and analyzed at South County Hospital, Wakefield, Rhode Island. The results for five of the crewmembers were negative. Results of the initial drug screening of the sixth crewmember, tankerman 1, identified the presence of amphetamines. Consistent with Federal regulations, the EMC contracted for the services of a medical review officer (MRO) to further analyze and interpret the test results. Subsequent testing was then done at a federally approved testing laboratory, Greystone Health Sciences Corporation, in La Mesa, California. The MRO attributed the presence of the amphetamines to a valid prescription medication being taken by the deckhand. The results of the drug test conducted at this facility showed that the presence of amphetamines was below the drug screening cutoff level. The MRO then certified that tankerman 1 tested negative for all drugs. Because a blood sample was not analyzed, it is not possible to determine whether the medication had impaired the tankerman.  Survival Factors Coast Guard Rescue Boats The coxswain told Safety Board investigators that he had initially selected a UTB instead of an MLB because the UTB was faster and had a closed cockpit to protect the crew from the weather. According to the Coast Guard's Operator's Handbook, the UTB is a light-weight aluminum-hulled, 26-knot, multi-mission vessel and is designed for moderate weather and seas. The MLB is an all-steel high-endurance boat designed for SAR missions in rough seas, including heavy surf and bad weather. It has a semi-enclosed coxswain's platform and a maximum speed of 13 knots.  Hypothermia Protective Clothing The crewmen on the SAR mission wore anti-exposure coveralls, the standard garments worn by Coast Guard crewmembers during cold-weather operations in closedcockpit boats. A coverall provides mobility and adequate protection from limited exposure to wind and spray, but it is not designed to protect someone who is immersed in cold water from hypothermia. When the coxswain, his crewmen, and the two tug crewmen later returned to the North Cape on the salvage mission, everyone except the coxswain wore survival suits. A survival suit encapsulates the wearer, providing excellent thermal protection for someone The urine samples were tested for the five drugs specified in Coast Guard (46 CFR 16.350) and Department of Transportation (49 CFR 40.21) regulations: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. 16   Factual Information  26  immersed in cold water. But the suit is cumbersome and bulky, making it difficult for the wearer to perform actions requiring dexterity. Both the UTB and the MLB carry survival suits. On the salvage mission, the coxswain wore a dry suit. The dry suit fits tightly so that it can keep the wearer dry and warm even if he is immersed in cold water. The suit is durable and flexible, and allows the coxswain the dexterity needed to operate the vessel, but it is not buoyant. Dry suits are normally stored at the boat station, rather than carried aboard the boats. When a coxswain is on a rescue mission, he is responsible for designating a crewmember to be a swimmer. If the coxswain knows before he gets to the accident scene that someone will have to be rescued from the water, he is supposed to have the swimmer don either a wet or a dry suit and a safety harness before the rescue boat arrives (Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M10470.10C ""Hypothermia Protective Clothing""). (A wet suit allows a layer of water to enter between the wearer's skin and the wet suit. Once the layer of water is warmed by the wearer's own body heat, it provides limited protection from hypothermia.)  Swimmer's Hypothermia The coxswain returned to the station as soon as he discovered that the swimmer had hypothermia. The coxswain told Safety Board investigators that he probably would have taken the tug crewmen directly to the barge had the swimmer not been hypothermic. He also said that had it not been for the explosion on the tug, he would have transferred the tug crewmembers directly to the MLB without their having to enter the water.  Other Information Towing Vessel Industry There are about 5,200 towing vessels in the United States, constituting, after fishing vessels, the largest segment of the U.S. commercial vessel industry. Most towing vessels are under 1,500 horsepower and operate mainly on inland waterways. The vessels push or tow 37,000 barges along the U.S. coasts, inland waterways, rivers, harbors, bays, and the Great Lakes. Over 32,000 crewmembers are employed for about 90 million onduty hours annually aboard the vessels. The members of the American Waterways Operators (AWO) include the majority of the owners and operators of U.S. towing vessels and barges. It is the national trade association for the inland and coastal barge and towing industry. The AWO has recently established a responsible carrier program (RCP) designed to improve marine safety and environmental protection. The RCP provides AWO members with broad guidelines and a model to use in developing company-specific safety programs that incorporate safe   Factual Information  27  operating practices not currently required by Coast Guard regulations. According to the AWO, the RCP is a voluntary safety program, and each company should tailor the program to its own operations. The EMC is a member of the AWO and is currently working to adopt the RCP. However, not all towing companies in the United States are members of the AWO, and many companies have their own safety programs.  Towing Vessel Accidents The Safety Board's investigation of the September 1972 accident of the tug Carolyn and the unmanned barge Weeks No. 254 identified the need to arrest a drifting barge using its anchor, similar to the issue of arresting the drift of the North Cape in this accident. The Safety Board found that the Weeks could have been prevented from drifting into the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel (CBBT) by using the barge's anchor. The bridge's piers were damaged extensively, and the CBBT was closed for 14 days. The resulting loss, excluding the cost of repairing the CBBT, was estimated at $3,397,000 (in 1972 dollars). The accident occurred when the tug Carolyn lost propulsive power while towing the Weeks in the Chesapeake Bay. The vessels drifted in heavy winds and collided with the CBBT. The Coast Guard cutter Madrona and the commercial tug Warrengas were standing by to assist. The Safety Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the captain of the tug to inform the Madrona or the Warrengas that the barge had a quick-release anchor and the decision of the commanding officer of the Madrona not to take the tug in tow as a last resort. Although unmanned barges are not required by regulation to have anchors, the Weeks had one and a trailing trip wire to release the anchor. To activate the trip wire, the tug would have had to circle to the rear of the barge, but the tug had lost propulsion. Either of the assist vessels could have activated the trip wire but did not because their crews were not told of the wire's existence, and a trip wire is a rare feature on an unmanned barge. The tug dropped its own anchor, but the anchor was too small to hold against the combined pull of the barge and the tug. The Safety Board recommended that the Coast Guard: Determine the need for anchors on unmanned barges and practical methods of controlling such anchors in order to prevent damage to any vessel, bridge, or other structure or other loss to bystanders on the navigable waters of the United States. (M-74-4). In October 1976, the Coast Guard responded that the effectiveness of ""braking"" with an anchor depends on the time and distance available when the navigator finds the vessel in imminent danger of collision. The Coast Guard argued that most accidents occur when a vessel is navigating close to other vessels, piers, or bridges, where the effectiveness of dropping an anchor is negligible. Therefore, the Coast Guard concluded,   Factual Information  28  unmanned barges do not need to have anchors. In June 1977, the Safety Board classified the safety recommendation ""Closed--Acceptable Response."" Coast Guard Information on Towing Vessel Accidents. According to the Coast Guard, between 1992 and 1996, towing vessels had 188 fires, almost all of which started in an engineroom. Many of the fires resulted in a total constructive loss of the tug, and several could not be brought under control without the help of outside emergency responders. In number, fires ranked as the second most common type of towing vessel accident, after groundings. Coast Guard data show that 80 percent of the total fatalities (64 deaths) in the towing vessel industry between 1992 and 1995 are the result of slips on and falls overboard from tugs and barges during operations. The Coast Guard does not consider the data on crew injuries to be reliable, as the reporting threshold for injuries is subject to interpretation and, for various reasons, injuries are often not reported. In 1994, the Coast Guard published a report17 about the types and causes of accidents involving towing vessels. The report was based on statistics for 1981 through 1991. The study stated that the majority (58 to 62 percent) of towing vessel accidents were caused by human errors rather than by causes identifiable during vessel inspection, such as those associated with equipment or material failures (17 to 20 percent). The Coast Guard concluded that inspection requirements for towing vessels were not justified by the results of this study. Data on Oil Spills From Vessels. Coast Guard data on oil spills show that, in 1995, among all vessel types, barges were the leading contributors to medium oil spills (10,000 to 100,000 gallons) and to major oil spills (over 100,000 gallons). Medium and major oil spills accounted for 37 percent of the number of spills and 75 percent of the volume of oil spilled. Tank barges accounted for all three major oil spills in 1995 and for three of the four major oil spills in 1996, including this accident. The statistics for 1994 are similar: barges spilled 69 percent of the oil spilled and accounted for 38 percent of the number of medium and major oil spills. Of the oil spilled in medium and major oil spills, tanks ships accounted for only 3 percent of the volume. Between 1992 and 1996, barges spilled 67 percent of the oil spilled in medium and major oil spills, while tank ships and freight ships spilled 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Comparison of Regulations. Coast Guard regulations for tank vessels (tankers) are different from those for tug-oil barge systems in many areas of vessel safety. Table 1 compares some of the regulations in safety areas that are discussed in this accident report, such as fire safety and anchors on vessels.  17  Towing Vessel Inspection Study, August 1994, U.S. Coast Guard.   Factual Information  29  Table 1.

The phaseout deadline for a particular vessel depends on its age and size, with older and larger vessels scheduled to be phased out earlier, while smaller vessels (under 5,000 gross tons) can remain in service until 2015. According to the schedule, the North Cape must be either phased out or converted to a double hull by January 1, 2005. The Coast Guard estimates OPA 90 will affect 86 U.S. barges, 143 U.S. tank ships, and   Factual Information  30  856 international tank ships. In other words, 85 percent of the total domestic deadweight capacity presently available is scheduled to be retired or converted by 2015. On July 30, 1996, the Coast Guard published regulations designed to minimize the risk of oil pollution from single-hull barges until they are phased out in 2015. The regulations specify operational measures for towing vessels, including bridge resource management, vessel-specific watch keeping procedures, and minimum under-keel clearance. More regulations resulted from the grounding of the Morris Berman18 in Puerto Rico and from the Mauvilla19 accident (in which the towboat hit a railroad bridge in Alabama, causing 47 fatalities on Amtrak's Sunset Limited). In July 1996, the Coast Guard also issued a final rule, ""Navigation Safety Equipment for Towing Vessels,"" to ""help ensure that the mariner piloting a towing vessel has adequate equipment to safely navigate the waters being transited."" Under the rule, the towing vessel must have radar, searchlights, radios, compasses, swing-meters, echo-sounders, electronic position-fixing devices, and marine charts and publications. The rule also establishes standards for the maintenance, inspection, and serviceability of towlines and towing gear. In January 1997, the Coast Guard did an economic analysis and concluded that it is not economically feasible to retrofit double hulls onto single hulls. The Coast Guard determined that the potential environmental benefits are not significant compared with the costs of retrofitting a double hull, in view of the limited time remaining before the single-hulled vessels are phased out.  Tug of Opportunity System (TOS) A TOS is an organized system for diverting a tug, which may be towing or escorting another vessel or idling, to arrest a drifting oil barge or vessel. Under this system, information regarding the capabilities and locations of suitable tugs is monitored so that in an emergency the proper resources can be immediately dispatched to help. In addition, the system ensures that the tug is appropriate for the condition of the sea and for the size of the vessel to be helped. The Coast Guard is considering implementing such a system, operated by industry, in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. An alternative approach is to have dedicated tugs stationed in environmentally sensitive or otherwise high-risk areas to assist barges and tankers in distress.

Risk is the combination of the probability of an accident occurring together with its consequences. Risk assessment20 is an organized and systematic search for high-risk conditions existing in a system. It is a complex process by which the risks in a system are identified, prioritized, and presented. After the risks are identified, risk management strategies can be developed and prioritized in order of effectiveness. The system stakeholders can use the results of the risk assessment to select certain risk management strategies over others, based on the level of system risk they are willing to accept. The level of acceptable risk is often dictated by economic, social, and political considerations. In response to the Scandia accident, a regional risk assessment team (RRAT) was formed under the leadership of the Coast Guard and included representatives from the departments of environmental protection of the Northeastern States (Rhode Island, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York), the AWO, and environmental advocacy groups. In February 1997, the representatives completed a report titled Regional Risk Assessment of Petroleum Transportation on the Waters of the Northeast United States (RRAT report). In the report, the RRAT reviewed current industry practices, reviewed casualty and oil spill data, critiqued Federal regulations, and assessed industry programs that influence vessel operation. The RRAT's purpose was to develop recommendations to help the Coast Guard develop regulations to improve safety and reduce the risks of transporting petroleum products by tug-barges through the Northeastern States. The scope of the report was limited, as it did not address fire safety on towing vessels; the Towing Safety Advisory Committee21 (TSAC) later submitted recommendations on fire safety to the Coast Guard for consideration in its rulemaking.  Rulemakings after Accident The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 required the Coast Guard to develop regulations, in consultation with the TSAC, to reduce the number of oil spills from single-hull barges. The Act requires an oil barge to have at least one of the following features:  For more information on risk assessment as it applies to marine vessel operations, see Marine Accident Report--Allison of the Liberian Freighter Bright Field with the Poydras Street Wharf, Riverwalk Marketplace, and New Orleans Hilton Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana, December 14, 1996 (NTSB/MAR-98/01). The TSAC provides the Coast Guard with industry and operations-related recommendations to assist with the development of regulations. The TSAC is authorized by Congress and represents a broad cross section of the towing industry. 21  20   Factual Information  32  (a) an operable anchor and a crewmember capable of stopping the barge from drifting ashore, (b) an emergency system that will allow the tug to retrieve the barge if the tow line breaks, and (c) any other means, equivalent to the above, to protect the barge from grounding. In addition, the Act requires that a tug engaged in towing barges have a fire suppression system or its equivalent. In response to the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, the Coast Guard issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in October 1997 to improve towing-vessel and tank barge safety in a variety of areas. The proposed rules were developed in consultation with the TSAC, as required by the Authorization Act, and were based on the recommendations made in the RRAT report. The Coast Guard proposed the following rules in response to the Scandia accident: For improving fire suppression measures aboard towing vessels, the Coast Guard proposed that all new tugs and, within 2 years, all existing tugs have the following:   A firemain system and fire pump that can be operated from the tug's pilothouse and locally at the pump. Fixed fire extinguishing systems in enginerooms on new tugs longer than 79 feet,22 in addition to the portable extinguishers that regulations currently require. For smaller new tugs and existing tugs of any size, semi-portable extinguishers are required in addition to the portable fire extinguishers currently required. Remote fuel and engine shutdowns. Muster list that identifies the crew's responsibilities and procedures in a firefighting emergency. Instruction and drills, including engineroom firefighting drills that are held at least once a month. Safety orientations to familiarize crewmembers with their vessel's safety features.       The NPRM solicited public comment on voyage planning requirements and mentions recommendations made by the RRAT and the TSAC to the Coast Guard on this Seventy-nine feet is used to differentiate between large and small tugs for application of the regulations and follows the same breakpoint used for fishing vessel regulations. The need for the differentiation is based on the practicality, space limitations, and cost effectiveness of installing certain equipment on small tugs. 22   Factual Information  33  subject. The recommendations include requiring documented company policies and procedures to take into account weather forecasts and the adequacy of vessel equipment before starting a voyage. The NPRM proposed any one of three methods for stopping drifting tank barges:  Operable Anchor for Manned Barges: In an emergency, a trained person on the barge can drop the anchor. The anchor system should be maintained and inspected to ensure that it is operable. The NPRM did not propose operable anchors for unmanned barges. Emergency Barge Retrieval System: The tug and barge are equipped with an emergency retrieval system that allows the tug to retrieve the barge if the towline breaks. The tug's crewmembers must be trained in the use of the equipment, and annual retrieval drills should be conducted. The system can be used on either an unmanned or a manned barge. Any Other Approved System: This option allows for the use of systems developed by industry in the future that offer a level of safety equal to or greater than the level offered by the other measures.      Pollution Response The method of coordinating the participating agencies; the Federal, State, and local governments; the trustees; and the industry, civic, and environmental groups that were involved in cleaning up the pollution are outlined in the area contingency plan. The pollution cleanup was coordinated by the Coast Guard acting as the Federal on-scene coordinator (FOSC). The FOSC set up a command post in Galilee, Rhode Island, and was assisted by the Coast Guard's Atlantic Strike Team (AST) and a regional response team composed of Federal, State, and local government representatives and the EMC. An estimated 700 people were involved in the pollution response and cleanup. The Federal Government billed the EMC about $1,900,000 for the cost of cleaning up the pollution. The DEM and NOAA were notified of a potentially major oil spill about 3 p.m. on the day of the accident, according to Coast Guard status reports on pollution response and notification activities (POLREPs). NOAA personnel estimated the trajectory of the potential spill to determine its probable impact on the coastline. POLREPs show that the AST was activated about 4 p.m. and arrived on scene around midnight. The AST assisted the FOSC by coordinating response, salvage, and lightering (pumping out remaining oil from the North Cape) activities, monitoring contractors, and assessing shoreline cleanup priorities. About 6:15 p.m., the EMC authorized its oil-spill cleanup contractors to deploy deflection booms, sorbent materials, and onshore/offshore oil skimmers to protect areas identified by the Coast Guard as being environmentally sensitive. About the same time, the EMC also engaged a marine salvage company and deployed three tugs and a 30,000barrel-capacity oil barge to lighter the remaining oil from the North Cape so that it would not exacerbate the pollution by continuing to leak. The lightering operations were   Factual Information  34  severely restricted over the next few days by intermittently stormy weather (winds up to 50 knots and 6- to 8-foot seas), which endangered the lightering and salvage crews. The AST report states that 74,550 barrels of heating oil were lightered from the North Cape. The North Cape was eventually re-floated off Nebraska Shoal on January 26, 1996, and removed from the scene.   35  Analysis  Exclusions The following factors were eliminated as causal to the accident: the crew's qualifications, fatigue, and use of drugs. The Coast Guard took the tug crewmembers to shore about 3 hours after the fire was detected. The opportunity to conduct chemical testing was further delayed because of the crewmembers' involvement in the salvage operations. During the salvage operation, two tug crewmembers tried to board the barge, and the captain and remaining crewmen were on shore monitoring the salvage and communicating with the salvage crew. Thus, all tug crewmen were involved in the salvage operation in some capacity. The last crewmember, who was airlifted from the barge, was returned to shore after 10 p.m. Shortly thereafter, all crewmembers were tested for alcohol. Because 9 hours had elapsed between the fire and the breathalyzer test, the Safety Board cannot conclusively determine that alcohol was not present in any of the Scandia crewmembers.23 24 On the day of the accident, none of the tug crewmembers reported suffering from any serious medical conditions. No evidence suggests that any of the crewmembers were impaired by alcohol or controlled substances. Tankerman 1 had been taking prescription medicine containing amphetamines. Although it could not be determined what, if any, effect the medicine had on him at the time of the accident, nothing about his performance suggests that he was impaired. Although the crewmembers had less than 6 hours of sleep before the start of their shift, it does not appear that their performance was impaired by fatigue or that fatigue played any role in this accident. 25  The qualifications of the crewmembers either met or exceeded the requirements of the Coast Guard. Because of the rate at which humans metabolize alcohol, evidence of alcohol is usually eliminated from the body in about 8 hours. Because problems and solutions associated with the timing of postaccident drug and alcohol testing were explored in a March 13-15, 1997, Safety Board Public Hearing and were comprehensively addressed in a subsequent Safety Board report, they are not discussed here. For more information, read Marine Special Investigation Report--Postaccident Testing for Alcohol and Other Drugs in the Marine Industry and the Ramming of the Portland-South Portland (Million Dollar) Bridge at Portland, Maine, by the Liberian Tankship Julie N on September 27, 1996 (NTSB/SIR-98/02). Because the crewmembers worked on a 6-hour-on-6-hour-off schedule, it is unlikely that they slept for a full 6 consecutive hours when they were off duty. 25 24 23   Analysis  36  Safety Issues In this accident, the Safety Board identified the following safety issues, which are examined in this report: Origin and cause of fire. Management oversight of vessel maintenance. Risk assessment: Weather and voyage planning. Barge retrieval systems. Anchors on unmanned barges. Fire safety of towing vessels. Search and rescue: Deployment of Coast Guard rescue boat. Hypothermia protective clothing. Decision to return to barge to drop its anchor. Environmental pollution and cleanup.  Fire Safety Board investigators analyzed the fire damage they saw in the Scandia's fidley to determine the fire's point of origin and cause. The investigators ruled out the exhaust gas turbocharger in the lower engineroom as a point of origin for several reasons. Because the turbocharger was separated by as much as 15 feet (aft) from the center of the fidley, which was the part that was most severely damaged by the fire, and because no burn path indicated that the fire had traveled between the two locations, the moderate heat discoloration of the paint on the turbocharger casing alone does not indicate that the turbocharger was likely to have been the place where the fire began. The absence of damage on the casing from flame impingement, together with the fact that the rubber vibration joint remained intact and unmelted, indicates that the turbocharger was not exposed to the large high-temperature fire that consumed the parts of the vessel above. Instead, the discoloration of the casing and the surface burns on the rubber joint are consistent with damage sustained during the long periods when the lube oil from the turbocharger leaked onto the adjacent hot engine manifold and onto the rubber joint and burned--a maintenance problem repeatedly mentioned on EMC   Analysis  37  discrepancy reports. However, the effects of heat from just above the rubber joint and turbocharger, would discoloration caused by the leaking oil. The Safety Bo leaking turbocharger oil was a serious fire hazard, it was the lower engineroom had no other damage from fire or out as the location of the origin of the fire.  the fire in the fidley, which was have exacerbated the burn and ard determines that although the not the cause of the fire. Because smoke, the Safety Board ruled it  The most intense heat damage was concentrated around the center and port areas of the fidley grating, where the steel had melted and sagged downward. The I-beam on the port side, which was above the sagging section of grating, was warped from the heat, showing that the hottest area was both below it and toward the port side. Because the natural convection of air causes heat to rise and fires to burn upward, the fire most likely originated at the grating and then traveled upward. Also, glass globes of light bulbs soften when heated and normally bulge out in the direction of the hottest temperature, providing a clue to where a fire has started. In this case, the bulb pointed to the sagging section of the fidley grating. Greater heat damage on the port-side ventilation louvers on the exhaust stack, compared to the starboard louvers, also indicates that the fire was more intense on the port side of the fidley. The testimony of the captain and the dayman, both of whom fought the fire, is also consistent with the physical evidence of the fire damage, in that they reported seeing scattered small fires near the center of the fidley and toward the port side but no fire in the engineroom below. All these factors lead to the same conclusion; consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the fire on the Scandia originated near the center of the fidley grating, which was above the main engine exhaust manifold. The Safety Board attempted to determine what may have caused the fire. Because laboratory tests failed to identify the blackened residue on the manifold where its insulation had come loose and on the sides of the engine below it and because the EMC and the crew could not provide any useful information, investigators considered substances that were likely to have been used aboard the tug at the time it caught fire.26 Because the Scandia was approaching the confined waters near Providence, the normal practice would have been to haul in the towline (barge) and put the Scandia in the pushing mode. The crew was probably preparing to apply grease to the steel towline before hauling it in, in keeping with common industry practice.  Various greases, lubricants, and paints were typically used by the crew of the Scandia for routine maintenance and operation of the tug's towline, machinery, and equipment. According to the manufacturer's data sheets, the greases and lubricants are petroleum based and pose a fire risk; consequently, they should be stored in sealed containers away from hot surfaces and areas of high temperature, such as the fidley.  26   Analysis  38  As part of the preparation, a crewmember may have placed a container of the towline grease (or a similar flammable lubricant) on the fidley grating to melt the grease before applying it. According to the EMC, the towline grease is normally stowed in a 5gallon container on the weather deck, where it was cold that day and where the grease might have solidified. The EMC did not have a documented and enforceable policy of prohibiting the storage of flammable liquids in the engineroom. Because the Scandia was rolling in 8- to 10-foot seas, the grease probably spilled from its container onto the grating. In this event, the grease-like substance would have melted and dripped onto the part of the manifold with loose insulation; the temperature of the manifold, 950  F, would have been high enough to ignite27 the substance on contact. The blackened residue observed on the manifold and on the sides of the engine below it was most likely the burned, grease-like substance. The substance that spilled is more likely to have been a high-viscosity grease-like material, such as towline lubricant, than a comparatively low-viscosity kerosene or diesel, as the latter would have run through the grating onto the engine and ignited. Such an event would have left evidence of a fire on the top and sides of the engine and, probably, also on the walkways around the engine. The Safety Board concludes that rough seas may have caused a container of flammable lubricant to fall onto the part of the engine manifold that had loose insulation, where the lubricant ignited on contact; however, the cause of the fire could not be precisely determined. After igniting at the manifold, the fire, because of natural convection, spread upward into the fidley and set fire to the puddles of spilled grease lying on the grating. The burning puddles provide a reasonable explanation for what the crewmen described as a number of small scattered fires on the grating. The flames from the burning grease then gradually set fire to the wooden storage cabinets attached to the bulkhead; from there, the fire progressed to the bulkheads themselves and then to the overheads. Because the tug's interior bulkheads were sheathed with combustible materials, the fire from the fidley continued to spread upward to the accommodations and to the remaining parts of the Scandia. Because the fire moved up and away from the manifold, the remaining sections of insulation on the manifold were not burned. The Federal Bureau of Investigation participated in the U.S. Department of Justice's criminal investigation of this accident but found no evidence to suggest that anyone had deliberately set the fire, and neither the EMC nor the vessel's crew was subsequently charged by the Department of Justice with deliberately setting the fire. (See appendix.) Safety Board investigators also found no evidence that the fire was deliberately set. The flash point of the towline grease/lubricant used on the Scandia was about 457 F, according to the EMC. 27   Analysis  39  Management Oversight of Vessel Maintenance After reviewing the Scandia's discrepancy reports, interviewing EMC operations department personnel responsible for the oversight of vessel maintenance, and evaluating the implementation of the EMC's VIP, the Safety Board determined that the EMC's management oversight of vessel maintenance was poor, which resulted in reducing the safety of its vessels. The VIP formed the cornerstone of the EMC's program of having its management oversee vessel maintenance. However, the Safety Board found that although the EMC had a VIP on paper, the EMC did not implement the VIP in practice, as evidenced by the discrepancy reports. Had the EMC followed its VIP, there would not have been the numerous instances of extended delays in repairing safety and maintenance items because the program required that serious safety deficiencies be repaired within about 2 weeks. Instead, safety and maintenance problems were not corrected for months, sometimes for more than a year. For example, when the Scandia's engineroom underwent extensive repairs after the 1995 fire in the boiler, the EMC could have fixed the long-outstanding problems noted on the discrepancy reports for the previous months.28 Instead, the EMC did not fix serious29 discrepancies, as evidenced by a subsequent discrepancy report that the turbocharger was leaking and by a leak in the exhaust system. Signi complaints management that repairs procedures. ficant delays in making repairs, as evidenced by the on their monthly discrepancy reports, demonstrate did not oversee the maintenance process and did not have were done in a timely enough manner to comply with crew's repeated that the EMC's controls to ensure the EMC's own  Because the EMC, by policy, did not keep maintenance or repair records, the operations department did not have a database with which to track the Scandia's history of repairs and maintenance. Without such a history, maintenance managers could not monitor trends in failure rates of the Scandia's equipment and could not make informed decisions about the vessel's need for preventative maintenance. The result was poor maintenance of the Scandia and repeated complaints from its captains. Lacking a proactive preventative maintenance approach, the EMC defaulted to making repairs only after systems broke down, hampering the vessel's operation and the EMC's commercial objectives. Not only did the absence of a planned maintenance program result in the Scandia being poorly maintained, the absence probably affected the maintenance of the entire  When a vessel undergoes extensive repairs and overhauls, it is generally economical, as well as convenient, to do other outstanding repairs. According to the ABS, exhaust leaks can be serious safety hazards and result in a vessel's safety classification status being withdrawn; however, ABS rules state that it is the vessel owner's responsibility to bring known deficiencies that could affect a vessel's classification status to the ABS's attention. There is no record in ABS survey documents of the turbocharger and exhaust leaks. Regulations do not require uninspected tugs to be classed with the ABS. 29  28   Analysis  40  EMC fleet. The EMC's process for exercising vessel maintenance (the VIP) was applied to all vessels in the EMC fleet and was enforced by the same personnel at the EMC. The EMC's practice of making repairs only after serious breakdowns had already occurred, rather than taking a preventive maintenance approach, and its poor oversight of maintenance resulted in a reduction of the Scandia's safety. Some of the discrepancies, such as missing safety guards, required relatively minor effort to fix; consequently, they should have been expeditiously repaired by vessel crewmen. By allowing the vessel's fire pump to corrode to the point of developing holes the size of a quarter, by permitting fire hoses with mismatched hose threads, and by sealing off emergency escape hatches, the EMC rendered these key safety features ineffective. Because the engineroom smoke described in the discrepancy report for June 1995 was severe enough to have been seen by passing vessels, the smoke was likely to have discouraged the Scandia's crewmembers from effectively monitoring the proper functioning of engineroom equipment during their engineroom tours. In addition to being an obvious safety hazard for the Scandia, the severe smoke also posed a health hazard for its crew. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that the EMC's oversight of vessel maintenance for its fleet was inadequate and that the implementation of its VIP was ineffective. The Safety Board believes that the EMC should develop and implement an effective management oversight program that provides maintenance managers with enough information to track maintenance trends and to make informed maintenance decisions that will ensure the safety of the company's fleet and crews. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code) in 1993. The ISM Code provides important guidance to shipping companies for exercising oversight of the operation and maintenance of oil tankers in international trade. However, no comparable guidance applies to tug-barges involved in domestic oil transportation. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard and the AWO should cooperate to develop and implement an effective safety management code to ensure adequate management oversight of the maintenance and operation of vessels involved in oil transportation by barges. The Safety Board notes that although the EMC is establishing a personal computer-based maintenance and repair database for its fleet, enough information is not yet available to judge its quality.  Risk Assessment The assessment and management of risk are the foundations of the Coast Guard's marine-safety and environmental-protection regulations, which are designed to prevent marine accidents and their effects on the public and environment.   Analysis  41  The RRAT's risk assessment, performed after the Scandia accident, was intended to assist the Coast Guard in developing effective towing vessel safety regulations. However, after analyzing the regulations proposed by the NPRM in light of this accident investigation, the Safety Board finds that a number of significant risks are not adequately addressed by the risk management strategies proposed in the NPRM. Some of the proposed risk management strategies include:     Weather and voyage planning. Barge retrieval systems. Anchors on unmanned barges. Fire safety of towing vessels.  Each of these risk management strategies is discussed below in light of the risks exposed in this investigation. Weather and Voyage Planning. The Safety Board analyzed the captain's vessel operations in light of the predicted weather and the actual on-scene weather and found that although a winter storm was rapidly approaching, the captain continued to proceed into the open seas of the Race, thus reducing his margin of safety for avoiding the storm. Further, the captain did not take into account updated weather information to reassess his decision to continue his voyage beyond the sheltered waters of Long Island Sound to the Race, and neither he nor the EMC had any plan to consider alternatives in case the vessel was endangered by the storm. The SMIBs, the NWS weather forecasts, and the Coast Guard's news release all predicted that the seas and winds would worsen rapidly later that afternoon. A comparison of the forecasts with accounts of actual on-scene weather, obtained from several SITREPs and from the MLB crewmen, shows that the forecasts were accurate in predicting that the storm would intensify in the late afternoon. Weather information from the MLB crewmembers is reliable because they were on scene both before and after the storm had reached its height. That the rapid change in on-scene weather was consistent with the forecast of a ""fast moving storm"" during the late afternoon is evidenced by the timeline below: 1:57 p.m.: winds S-SE/ 25 knots, seas 6 to 8 feet about 3 p.m.: winds 26 to 36 knots, seas 10 to 12 feet 4:30 p.m.: seas 25 to 30 feet 5 p.m.: winds S-SE /40 to 50 knots, seas 20 to 30 feet In the 1 1/2 hours after the fire started, the weather deteriorated significantly enough for the Scandia to be in danger of being swamped by 20- to 30-foot waves.   Analysis  42  Because the Scandia was just over an hour away30 from the shelter of Narragansett Bay (which lay en route to Providence) when the fire started, the captain might have reached the bay during the 1 1/2 hours if the fire had not broken out. However, the captain did not have detailed weather updates or information with which to plan or ""time"" his voyage; he simply proceeded toward the bay because it was the shelter closest to him and was en route to his destination. The captain's margin of safety was so narrow that he might have failed to reach the shelter of the bay even had there been no fire, because the timing of fast-moving storms usually cannot be predicted precisely. The weather also played a key role in the grounding of and pollution from the North Cape. After the Scandia's crew was rescued by the Coast Guard, the waves rapidly increased between 3 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. The crewmen who later boarded the barge to release its anchor discovered that the waves had increased to between 20 and 30 feet and were washing over the barge, making it impossible to release the ""jury-rigged"" anchor without risking severe injury. Had the weather not turned so severe, they may have been able to release the anchor, even though it would have taken longer than if the windlass had been in place. (The effect of releasing the anchor is discussed later under ""Anchors on Barges."") The severity of the weather also prevented other assist vessels, such as the tug Morton Bouchard, from reaching the scene in time to prevent the North Cape from drifting aground. The tug Catherine departed about 3:50 p.m. from New London, Connecticut, but was considerably slowed because the storm was reaching its peak about that time. Both tugs arrived after the North Cape had already run aground. After the storm gained intensity, 30-foot waves and 50-knot winds forced the Coast Guard cutter Point Turner to abort its attempt while en route to the North Cape. A small harbor tug at the station's harbor, the Capt Tom, overheard the Scandia's MAYDAY but was unable to assist because it was incapable of operating in such severe weather without endangering itself. Despite the prediction of a sharp deterioration in the weather, the captain of the Scandia allowed himself only a narrow margin in which to avoid facing such weather in open seas; consequently, the Safety Board analyzed the EMC's operations to determine whether establishing voyage planning procedures could increase the safety of the operations of the EMC's vessels. This investigation shows that the EMC had no procedures that would enable the crew to assess weather-related voyage risks or require the captain to obtain updated weather information or require the captain to consult the EMC's shoreside management about the risk of continuing the voyage under the prevailing weather conditions. The lack of participation by the EMC's shoreside management in evaluating and responding to the risks posed by the predicted storm reduced the operational safety of the tug and barge.  Based on a reduced speed of 5 knots due to the weather and a distance of 6.5 miles to the entrance of Naragansett Bay from the Scandia's location when the fire was reported.  30   Analysis  43  Because the captain did not obtain updated weather information, he did not have the information necessary to assess the risk involved in continuing his voyage into the Race. He may have underestimated how close he actually was to the storm front. Updated and long-term (48 to 72 hours) weather information would have helped him plan his voyage more prudently, significantly increasing the safety margin of his operations. The captain and the EMC's shoreside management did not consult about continuing the voyage from Long Island Sound into the Race. Had the EMC's management helped the captain to identify the risks, alternative courses of action could have resulted. An example of an alternative would have been the captain seeking safe harbor while the Scandia was sailing in the sheltered lee of Long Island Sound before proceeding into the exposed waters of the Race, where the vessel encountered rapidly worsening weather. The lack of an operable windlass may have deterred the captain from seeking shelter in the sound because once an anchor is dropped, it cannot be retrieved without a windlass. However, the need for an anchor in case the weather rapidly worsened should have been considered by the EMC through use of an equipment checklist as a part of voyage planning procedures. Although the EMC left all weather-related decisions entirely to the captain, the Safety Board points out that current maritime safety management practices, such as those embodied in the ISM Code, emphasize that responsibility for vessel safety cannot be limited to ship captains but must be shared by the upper levels of the company's shoreside management.31 Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the EMC should develop and implement procedures whereby designated management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. The procedures should be directed toward facilitating the making of timely decisions that affect the safety of company vessels and crews. The Safety Board also believes that the Coast Guard should require towing vessel companies to develop and implement procedures whereby management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. Voyage planning does more than improve the communications between a captain and his company's shoreside management; voyage planning can significantly improve a company's oversight of operations and its evaluation of weather-related risks, thereby reducing, at the planning stages of a voyage, the risk of an accident. The Scandia accident shows that EMC's inadequate oversight of vessel operations resulted in the Scandia's lack of preparedness to encounter the predicted bad weather and contributed to the accident. For example, if the EMC had had a checklist to ensure that the loose equipment and material aboard the Scandia were secured in heavy weather, to ensure that flammable materials were not stored in the engineroom, and to ensure that the North Cape was adequately equipped for the anticipated weather, the crew might have thought through the  For more information, see Marine Accident Report--Near Grounding of the Liberian Tank Ship Patriot, Bay of Campeche, Mexico, October 15, 1995 (NTSB/MAR-97/01/SUM).  31   Analysis  44  process of preparing for heavy weather and taking the necessary precautions, thus significantly improving the safety of operations. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that because the EMC did not have adequate voyage planning procedures to ensure that adequate weather information and operational precautions were considered in its decisionmaking, the risk reduction measures that could have been taken before the voyage began were not taken. Consequently, the Safety Board believes that the EMC should develop and implement voyage planning procedures and checklists for its towing vessels to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. Further, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard, in conjunction with the towing vessel industry, should develop and implement requirements for voyage planning standards and checklists for towing vessel companies to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. Moreover, the AWO should encourage its member towing vessel companies to develop and implement such standards and checklists. The Coast Guard's NPRM solicited public comments on voyage planning, and the Safety Board's recommendations, based on the findings of this accident investigation, are particularly relevant to the Coast Guard's request. They highlight the importance of voyage planning to the safety of tug-barge operations. Barge Retrieval Systems. In its NPRM, the Coast Guard proposed the use of an emergency barge retrieval system as an acceptable method by which a tug can recover its barge if the towline breaks. If the towline between a tug and its barge breaks, the tug can use an emergency barge retrieval system to retrieve its barge, but only if the tug, itself, is operational. In this accident, however, even if the Scandia had had a retrieval system, the vessel could not have used the system because the vessel was completely disabled by the fire. The same consequence would also result if a tug were to suffer other casualties, such as flooding, sinking, capsizing in heavy seas, or grounding. In such situations, a tug that has a retrieval system and is dispatched from another location is needed to retrieve the drifting barge. While a number of tugs set out to assist the North Cape and were prevented by the weather from arriving on scene in time, the tugs were not strategically located when they started their journey to assist and were selected by chance. No organized system ensured that the tugs were strategically located so they could reach the accident scene in time or that the tugs were powerful enough or possessed the proper equipment to provide the assistance necessary. There was also no assurance that their crewmembers were trained to handle emergency retrieval operations without seriously endangering themselves and their tugs. A TOS or an alternative system, therefore, may be necessary to complement the proposed retrieval system:   Analysis  45  In this accident there was a 4 -hour period, from the start of the fire to the grounding of the barge, within which the barge could have been retrieved. The Safety Board concludes that the use of a tug assistance system in conjunction with a barge retrieval system would have significantly improved the chance of arresting the drift of the North Cape and preventing its grounding. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard and the towing industry should institute a pilot project in the northeastern United States to evaluate the benefits of using an organized tug-assistance system to complement the proposed barge retrieval system or, if appropriate, develop and implement an alternative system to ensure barge retrieval if a tug becomes incapable of performing that function. Anchors on Unmanned Barges. An appropriately designed and installed  anchoring system may have reduced the possibility of grounding and pollution. chosen Sound. way to valuabl option. The captain had probably long been aware of the oncoming storm and could have to wait out the storm by dropping anchor in a harbor of safe refuge in Long Island However, the lack of a windlass would have deterred him because there is no easy retrieve an anchor without a windlass, and he would have lost the anchor--a e piece of equipment. This fact may explain why the captain never considered this  It is difficult to say with certainty whether the drifting North Cape could have been completely stopped before running aground even if the anchor and windlass had been properly installed and operable. The ability of an anchor to stop a vessel depends on various unknown factors, such as the holding power of the sea bottom compared to the magnitude of the drag forces exerted on the barge by the seas and wind. While an anchor is often ineffective in stopping a self-propelled vessel within a limited distance when the vessel is traveling at speed, the North Cape was drifting slowly, and there was a considerable distance for the anchor to take hold on the bottom before the barge grounded. Having an anchor drag along the bottom would have slowed the barge down and may have stopped it before it reached shore, thus giving the assist tugs much more time to reach it. The Safety Board therefore concludes that an operable anchor may have reduced the chance of the barge grounding. Anchors are routinely used to hold (to ""anchor"") a vessel in a waterway and are safety devices. (Although anchors are also used in emergencies as a braking device to stop the motion of a vessel that is underway at speed, anchors are not designed for this purpose and are likely to fail.) Just as Coast Guard regulations require anchors on manned barges to enhance their safety, so would anchors increase the safety of unmanned barges. The Coast Guard, however, does not require an unmanned barge to have an anchor because the Coast Guard recognizes that normally there is no one on an unmanned barge to release the anchor. Nevertheless, the North Cape was not unique in having an anchor and windlass because many owners equip their unmanned barges with an anchor and windlass for operational convenience. On such a barge, a crewman jumps from the tug to the barge.   Analysis  46  While the jump is usually safe under routine conditions, in rough seas or unfavorable conditions, the probability of injuries and deaths can be unacceptably high. In this accident, the lives of two tug crewmen were seriously endangered by the turbulent seas when they jumped aboard the North Cape to release the anchor. Even if the anchor and windlass had been properly installed, the Safety Board would have considered the risk to the crewmen's lives to be just as excessive. The Board's determination is supported by Coast Guard accident statistics, which show that slips and falls overboard are the largest cause of deaths and injuries in the towing industry. The Safety Board thinks that such risk reduction strategies as remotely operated quick releases for barge anchors should be considered as a way of avoiding the risks associated with transferring people to an unmanned barge. An example of using conventional technology for a remote anchor release is the trailing trip wire system that was used on the Weeks. The Safety Board notes that a trailing trip wire is not effective unless the tug is functional enough to be able to approach the trip wire to trip it. The Safety Board concludes that when a tug is disabled, modern devices, such as radiofrequency transmitters, that are suitably located on the tug may be effective in releasing the barge's anchor by remote control and that the use of such transmitters does not involve imposing risks on the crew. A remotely operated mechanism can be designed to operate independently of the tug's primary power systems so that the device is not dependent on the tug's ability to propel or steer itself. A remote device can be activated quickly even if a tug has lost propulsion or steering, is involved in a fire, or is sinking. In its NPRM, the Coast Guard invited readers to propose technological solutions to the problem of arresting drifting barges that are better than the existing techniques, which are often hazardous to the crews. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard, in conjunction with the towing vessel industry, should develop modern remote anchor release devices for barges in emergencies that do not expose crewmen to unnecessary risk. Further, the Safety Board believes that the AWO should encourage its members to work with the Coast Guard to develop a means of releasing anchors on unmanned towed barges by remote control from the towing vessel. Fire Safety of Towing Vessels. The safety of the Nation's fleet, about 30,000 barges, and its personnel and cargo, as well as the safety of the marine environment, depends to a large extent on the fire safety of the vessels that tow the barges. The fact has been consistently demonstrated by accident statistics for towing vessels, which show that fires are the second largest cause of towing vessel accidents. The statistics also show that almost all fires occur in the engineroom, where ignition sources, such as hot operating machinery and electrical equipment, are close to flammable fuels and oils and to the combustible materials used in the vessel's construction. The Scandia fire demonstrates how rapidly a fire on a tug can get out of control and cause a second accident involving a barge in its tow. The second accident caused large-scale pollution that significantly damaged the environment and drew public attention to this accident. The Safety Board determines that the chances of preventing pollution from towed oil barges would be greatly enhanced if Coast Guard regulations adequately addressed the fire safety of towing vessels.   Analysis  47  Despite the fact that the Scandia had firefighting equipment, such as the semiportable fire extinguishing system and the fire pump, that exceeded the Coast Guard requirements, the crew could not reach the equipment during the emergency. The intensity of the smoke and heat prevented the crewmembers from entering the fidley, and they could not reach the controls for the semi-portable extinguisher, which were only a few feet inside the fidley door. Consequently, the equipment was ineffective in fighting the fire. To use the semi-portable system, crewmembers would have had to enter the fidley and move close to the fire so that they could manually unreel the hose and direct its nozzle toward the base of the fire. To enter the fidley, however, the crew would have had to wear firemen's outfits and SCBAs. (A fireman's outfit provides protection from the heat, and an SCBA provides smoke-free, breathable air.) Firemen's outfits and SCBAs would also have significantly increased the effectiveness of the portable extinguishers, as the crewmen would have been able to get the extinguishers closer to the fire. The Safety Board notes that after the earlier fire on the Scandia (in 1995), the captain recommended that the EMC equip the vessel with two sets of firesuits and SCBAs and that the EMC did not comply. (The Safety Board also notes that the EMC has now provided its fleet with the equipment, but only after being directed to do so by a court.) The Safety Board concludes that the Scandia accident demonstrates the need for SCBAs and firesuits on towing vessels. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should require SCBAs and firesuits aboard all towing vessels, as well as training in their use. The crew would have been safer if the Scandia had had a fixed firefighting system in the engineroom that could be remotely operated from outside the engineroom. Crewmembers would not have been subject to the physical risks involved in entering a fire- and smoke-filled fidley, and the firefighting would have been more effective. The Safety Board supports the NPRM in proposing the requiring of fixed fire extinguishing systems in the enginerooms of new tugs but notes that the NPRM does not require fixed fire extinguishing systems aboard existing tugs. Also, the NPRM would not require tugs such as the Scandia to have firefighting equipment beyond what is already aboard the vessel, which the crew could not operate in this accident because the equipment controls were located in areas made inaccessible by the fire. The Safety Board concludes that the NPRM proposes a lower level of safety for existing tugs than for new tugs and would not make existing tugs any safer from the kind of fire that the Scandia experienced in this accident. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard should require approved fixed firefighting systems in the enginerooms of existing towing vessels. (The EMC, under court order, has equipped its existing vessels with fixed fire extinguishing systems.) Although the Scandia had a fire pump, it could only be operated from the pump in the lower engineroom. The crewmembers could not reach the lower engineroom because they could not even enter the smoke-filled fidley. (They needed to go down the stairway   Analysis  48  in the fidley to the lower engineroom, engage the clutch, and start the pump.) The Safety Board concludes that because the Scandia's fire pump could not be started from outside the engineroom, it could not be used for fighting this fire. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should implement the requirement in its NPRM that fire pumps on towing vessels also be operable from outside the engineroom. Neither the chief engineer, who led the firefighting, nor any other crewman was aware that the emergency remote shut-offs for the engineroom ventilation fans were just outside the fidley's aft door. The fans continued to supply the fire with fresh air, causing the fire to grow and spread rapidly. None of the crewmen activated the remote fuel pump or fuel valve shut-offs to the engineroom, which were also outside the aft door of the fidley. Basic marine firefighting requires that all ventilation and fuel supply to the engineroom be shut off in the event of an engineroom fire. Although the chief engineer had completed a Coast-Guard-approved basic firefighting course, his statements to Safety Board investigators and his actions during the emergency show that he was not familiar with the location of the Scandia's emergency shut-offs. Although the crewmembers told Safety Board investigators that they had participated in emergency drills, they showed a lack of familiarity with the Scandia's emergency firefighting systems. None of the crew had participated in engineroom firefighting drills on the Scandia, and none had been assigned specific duties in the event of a fire emergency. The chief engineer was the only crewman who said he knew how to operate the Scandia's fire pump. The Safety Board supports the proposals in the NPRM about requiring muster lists, drills on using SCBAs and fireman's outfits, and safety orientations that will familiarize crewmembers with their vessel before they sail. The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should incorporate these proposals in its regulations. The Safety Board notes that it will be up to the vessel owners to comply with the regulations and that, for uninspected vessels, the Coast Guard intends to rely on spot checks rather than on an inspection program. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should require vessel owners to keep detailed, signed logs of all on-board drills to assist the Coast Guard in its spot checks.  Risk Assessment--Summation. Because oil spill statistics from 1992 to 1996 show that oil barges spilled eight times more oil than tank ships, the Safety Board questions whether the Coast Guard's safety regulations for tug-barge systems are adequate when compared to those for tank vessels. A comparison of some of the fire safety regulations that are relevant to the Scandia accident shows that tank ships are subject to significantly higher safety regulations than tug-barge systems, although both carry similar cargoes. Regulatory   Analysis  49  differences in fire safety, as well as in other areas, such as vessel inspection and equipment redundancies, may explain why the pollution from tug-barges is so much greater than that from tank ships. If risks for tug-barge systems and tankers had been assessed with equal rigor, then the resulting regulations would probably have been comparable and would have provided an equivalent level of safety against pollution. Even though the RRAT conducted a risk assessment, based on which the Coast Guard issued the NPRM for improving tug-barge safety, the Board's investigation of this accident uncovered significant issues that were not addressed by the NPRM; thus, the proposed regulations may not be effective in reducing pollution. Even if the NPRM were adopted, it would not significantly reduce the overall regulatory discrepancy between tank vessels and tug-barges in many areas of safety, because the NPRM focuses only on safety issues relating to the Scandia accident. The Safety Board concludes that the large difference in the oil pollution data for the two vessel types quite likely results from the discrepancy in risk mitigation regulations that apply to them. The Coast Guard has both the authority and the responsibility to direct a comprehensive risk assessment to mitigate the effects of marine accidents on the public and the environment. The Safety Board therefore believes that the Coast Guard should conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to develop risk mitigation regulations for tugbarge systems that provide a level of safety against marine pollution equivalent to that provided by regulations for tankers.  Deployment of Coast Guard Rescue Boat The Coast Guard rescue boat crew lost 20 minutes in reaching the accident scene because the sea was unsafe for the 41-foot UTB, forcing the SAR crew to return for a 44foot MLB. The delay did not prevent the Coast Guard from rescuing the Scandia's crew. However, the delay allowed the fire to progress and caused a more dangerous situation to develop for the crewmembers while they waited for the Coast Guard to arrive. The delay also forced the SAR crew to conduct a more difficult in-the-water rescue because the wheelhouse windows on the tug had ""exploded"" by then, forcing the tug crew to enter the water. If the SAR crew had initially deployed in the MLB, the crew would have arrived 20 minutes sooner than it did, and the coxswain would been able to conduct a direct vessel-to-vessel transfer of the tug crew as he had earlier envisioned. With an out-of-thewater transfer, the swimmer would not have suffered from hypothermia, and the crew of the Scandia would have been exposed to less risk. The coxswain explained that he initially selected the UTB instead of the MLB because the UTB was significantly faster and more maneuverable and offered greater protection from the weather. The coxswain's points are valid, but he did not recognize that the wind and sea were too severe for a UTB until he was some distance out to sea.   Analysis  50  The coxswain made the decision to use a UTB instead of an MLB. According to the Coast Guard`s SAR plan, the selection of the boat is the responsibility of the officerin-charge (OIC) at the boat station. Because the OIC was not present at the time of the accident, it became the officer-on-duty's (OD's) responsibility. However, the OD did not give the coxswain any guidance about the type of boat to use. Although the coxswain morning, he did not check a m his knowledge of the weather When the coxswain launched, update. had ore on the seen a weather report posted at the station earlier that recent weather report at the station. Instead, he based what he could readily see from the station windows. duty watchstander did not supply the latest weather  In the Safety Board's opinion, the Coast Guard's procedures for deploying the proper boat were adequate. However, the Coast Guard station personnel did not adequately follow the procedures. For instance, the OD did not give the coxswain the necessary guidance for selecting the boat, and the coxswain failed to check the latest weather information. The Safety Board concludes that the OD and the coxswain did not consider the weather and sea conditions sufficiently in selecting the rescue boat, and the result was a 20-minute delay in arriving on scene. The Safety Board believes that Coast Guard stations should conduct a mandatory pre-deployment briefing for all SAR missions to ensure that the on-scene weather and sea conditions are assessed accurately so that the proper rescue boat is selected.  Hypothermia Protective Clothing The coxswain decided it was necessary to return to the station immediately so that the swimmer could be treated for hypothermia. The coxswain stated that had the swimmer not become hypothermic, the coxswain would have proceeded directly to the barge and attempted to drop its anchor before the weather worsened. Coast Guard procedures32 prescribing the use of hypothermia protective clothing specify that in cold-water areas, a surface swimmer should don either a wet suit or a dry suit and a safety harness en route to the scene of the accident if the coxswain or boat crew has prior knowledge that someone must be rescued from the water. The coxswain is responsible for selecting the swimmer from the boat crew. During the initial response to the Scandia, the coxswain did not tell the swimmer to outfit himself because the coxswain did not anticipate that a rescue from the water would be necessary. As a result, when the swimmer entered the water, he was wearing only anti-exposure coveralls, which were inadequate to protect him from hypothermia. In the Safety Board's opinion, it is likely that someone, either a Coast Guardsman or a civilian, will fall into the water during any small-boat rescue operation in rough seas. 32  U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M10470.10C ""Hypothermia Protective Clothing.""   Analysis  51  Therefore, the need for a swimmer to enter the water should always be anticipated under such conditions. Since it is extremely difficult to remove anti-exposure coveralls and don a dry or wet suit on a rolling and pitching small boat in rough seas, a pre-designated swimmer should don appropriate thermal protective garments before the boat leaves the station in cold-water areas. The Safety Board concludes that had the swimmer been properly attired, he probably would not have become hypothermic. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard should establish and implement procedures to require a pre-designated swimmer to don suitable thermal protective clothing before launching a small boat on a SAR mission in cold water.  Decision to Return to Barge The Safety Board analyzed the group commander's decision to send a Coast Guard crew, along with two Scandia crewmen, to the North Cape to drop its anchor. This decision required an analysis of the potential risks of injury or death to the Coast Guard and civilian personnel, an assessment of the risk of loss of or damage to Coast Guard resources, and a judgment about the probability of success. The group commander learned that assistance from commercial tugs would not be available in time; consequently, he knew that using a tug to re-establish control over the drifting barge was no longer an option. Then, after the air station declined to provide a helicopter to deliver the two tug crewmen to the barge, the group commander decided to send the MLB to the barge. He said that he believed because of several factors that the mission was likely to succeed: the EMC had assured him that the crew was capable of dropping the anchor, the coxswain had agreed to deliver the crewmen to the barge, and the tug crewmen themselves were confident they could drop the anchor within 5 minutes of boarding the barge. Although the group commander believed he had made a reasonable decision, in the Safety Board's view, the decision was based on incomplete facts and was not fully justified. Even though the EMC told the group commander that the tug crew could drop the anchor, the EMC did not fully understand either the condition of the surf in which the attempt would be made or the condition of the anchoring gear on the barge. The EMC had no knowledge of the limitations of the Coast Guard vessel or of the stress on the crew. While the EMC's advice may have been well intended, it was based upon incomplete knowledge of the conditions and should not have been a basis upon which the group commander made his decision. Although the coxswain agreed to the group commander's decision, the coxswain had no way of knowing that the sea and weather had become much more dangerous or that the barge would be in the surf when he arrived on scene. According to the group commander, the return trip to the barge would not have been attempted without the coxswain's consent. However, it is possible that the coxswain was so tired from having   Analysis  52  just completed a strenuous rescue operation in rough seas that he may have been incapable of accurately judging his own fitness for continued duty. The chief engineer and mate of the Scandia both volunteered to return to the barge and believed that they could be successfully drop the anchor within 5 minutes of boarding the barge. However, neither man knew what condition the anchoring equipment would be in when they boarded the barge or had any information about how treacherous the onscene conditions had become. Their belief that they could accomplish the task quickly was more a matter of wishful thinking than a matter of fact. Thus, the three criteria on which the group commander based his decision were little more than opinions with no basis in fact. Of particular concern to the Board was his decision to place civilian lives at risk to conduct this dangerous mission. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that although the coxswain, the Coast Guard boat crew, and the tug crew volunteers made a heroic attempt to prevent an oil spill, the decision to allow them to do so was ill-conceived and not justified. The Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod had informed the group commander that the air station would not provide a helicopter to deliver anyone to the barge because aviation risk assessment criteria specify that SAR personnel should only be placed at risk if human lives are in danger. When the group commander proceeded with the salvage mission, he did not tell the air station. Had he told the air station, its personnel may have reviewed the criteria for launching and may have made a decision not to place civilian and Coast Guard personnel at unnecessary risk. While the group commander thought he had assessed the risks fully before he ordered the attempt to drop the barge anchor, in the Safety Board's view he had not. He did not fully recognize the severity of the sea and weather conditions or anticipate that another life-threatening rescue would be necessitated as a result of the dangers encountered by the salvage crew. Such an assessment has been identified in previous Safety Board investigations. As a result of its investigation of the 1991 capsizing and sinking of the U.S. commercial fishing vessel Sea King,33 the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation M-92-54 to the Coast Guard: Incorporate into the training of SAR personnel procedures to ensure the gathering and dissemination of pertinent information by all appropriate SAR personnel to facilitate a thorough assessment of the potential risks to persons involved in a SAR mission. As the result of the investigation of three 1993 accidents34 involving Coast Guard SAR responses that proved unsuccessful because of the inadequacy of the risk For more information, read Marine Accident Report--Capsizing and Sinking of the U.S. Fishing Vessel Sea King Near Astoria, Oregon, January 11, 1991 (NTSB/MAR-92/05). 34 33  For more information, read Marine Accident Brief Reports--Grounding of the U.S. Sailing Pleasure   Analysis  53  assessments, the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation M-94-7 to the Coast Guard: Provide risk assessment training to all Coast Guard personnel directly involved in SAR missions. On November 21, 1994, the Coast Guard Commandant stated: I concur with these recommendations. The Coast Guard has taken action to add risk assessment training for SAR personnel at appropriate levels in the operational chain of command, and full implementation is expected by May of 1995. The Commandant's response further indicated that, as a result of the Board's recommendations, risk assessment training had been included in training courses for small-boat coxswains, for pilots and aircrews, for small-boat station commanders, for cutter commanders and executive officers, for operations-center watchstanders, and for group and station commanding officers and executive officers. As a result of the Commandant's response, Safety Recommendations M-92-54 and M-94-7 were classified ""Closed--Acceptable Action."" While the Safety Board is gratified that the Coast Guard has incorporated risk assessment training in the training for all levels of SAR activity, from small-boat coxswain to group commander, training in and of itself does not ensure that proper risk assessments will be made in all cases. To be truly effective, training must be reinforced by pertinent operational guidelines. According to the pilot of the second rescue helicopter, the operations officer at the air station declined to provide helicopter assistance for the salvage mission after consulting personnel from the Group. The request was denied because the formal risk assessment guidelines, which are in the Coast Guard Commandant's Instruction 3710, Air Operations Manual, prohibit the placing of a Coast Guard helicopter and air crew at grave risk for any operation, such as a salvage mission, that is not a life-threatening emergency. (The risk of losing the aircraft or the air crew is considered a grave risk.) The group commander did not have any comparable published formal risk assessment guidelines to follow in making his assessment of the risks presented by the salvage operation. In the Board's opinion, it is just as necessary to provide guidelines for placing Coast Guard surface craft and surface personnel at ""grave risk"" as it is to provide such guidelines for aircraft and aviation personnel. The guidelines should clearly explain the procedures for conducting risk assessments and analyses that are necessary before conducting SAR and salvage missions, for identifying grave risk to surface craft and personnel, and for obtaining concurrence and approval from the respective district commands. In particular, the guidelines should emphasize the need to protect civilian Craft Rite of Passage, Isle of Palms, South Carolina, August 4, 1993 (DCA-93-MM-023); Sinking of the U.S. Pleasure Craft Big Abalone, Coos Bay, Oregon, August 20, 1993 (DCA-93-MM-029); and Sinking of the U.S. Tug Duke Luedtke, in Lake Erie, Near Cleveland, Ohio, September 21, 1993 (DCA-93-MM-030).   Analysis  54  lives from unnecessary ""grave risk."" The Safety Board concludes that developing and implementing risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface SAR units that are similar to those for the deployment of aircraft would enhance the quality of risk assessments by Coast Guard operational commanders. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard should develop and implement risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface SAR units that are similar to those published in Coast Guard Commandant's Instruction 3710.  Coxswain's Decision to Leave Mate on Barge After returning to the scene, the chief engineer and the mate successfully boarded the barge. After their attempt to drop the anchor had failed, the coxswain was able to retrieve only the chief engineer. The coxswain spent about half an hour attempting to maneuver the MLB near the barge so that he could retrieve the mate, but he was unable to do so because the sea had worsened considerably. He was faced with an extremely difficult decision in weighing the dangers faced by his crew and vessel against the safety of the stranded crewman. The coxswain realized that the MLB was at risk of capsizing in the rough surf and that some of the MLB's electronic equipment was functioning erratically because of the rough seas. He asked for a Coast Guard helicopter to rescue the stranded crewman. He then left because there was nothing more that he could do other than endanger his vessel and crew. The Safety Board concludes that the coxswain's decision to leave after asking for a rescue helicopter for the stranded crewman was reasonable, considering the need to protect his own crew and vessel and his inability to retrieve the crewman.  Pollution Response Because the weather was rough enough to move the oil deflection booms from their intended locations and to hamper cleanup activities, some oil seeped into environmentally sensitive areas, resulting in a significant short-term impact on the fishing grounds and local fisheries. Because the spilled oil was light grade, much of it weathered and evaporated into the atmosphere under the action of sunlight and the turbulent waves, as demonstrated by the tests conducted by the EPA 5 days later, which showed that the level of petroleum hydrocarbon was well below the level considered harmful to marine life. Most of the remaining oil was corralled by the floating booms and mechanically skimmed from the surface by vacuum hoses. However, NOAA is still assessing the degree of long-term environmental damage, including the impact on fish and bird populations, which are expected to need several years to return to the numbers they had reached before the accident. As required by the area contingency plan, the responsible governmental agencies, parties, and environmental cleanup resources were notified soon after the crew abandoned the tug that a major oil spill was anticipated. Consequently, pollution cleanup resources were being transported to the scene well before the North Cape's tanks were breached.   Analysis  55  The Safety Board concludes that the notifications and the pollution cleanup response were adequate, considering the adverse weather following the accident.   56  Conclusions  Findings 1. Drugs, fatigue, and crew qualifications were not causal to this accident. 2. The fire on the Scandia originated near the center of the fidley grating, which was above the main engine exhaust manifold. 3. Rough seas may have caused a container of flammable lubricant to fall onto the part of the engine manifold that had loose insulation, where the lubricant ignited on contact; however, the cause of the fire could not be precisely determined. 4. The Eklof Marine Corporation's oversight of vessel maintenance for its fleet was inadequate, and the implementation of its vessel inspection program was ineffective. 5. Because the Eklof Marine Corporation did not have adequate voyage planning procedures to ensure that adequate weather information and operational precautions were considered in its decisionmaking, the risk reduction measures that could have been taken before the voyage began were not taken. 6. The use of a tug assistance system in conjunction with a barge retrieval system would have significantly improved the chance of arresting the drift of the North Cape and preventing its grounding. 7. An operable anchor may have reduced the chance of the barge grounding. 8. When a tug is disabled, modern devices, such as radio-frequency transmitters, that are suitably located on the tug may be effective in releasing the barge's anchor by remote control, and the use of such transmitters does not involve imposing risks on the crew. 9. The Scandia accident demonstrates the need for self-contained breathing apparatus and firesuits on towing vessels. 10. The Coast Guard's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposes a lower level of safety for existing tugs than for new tugs and would not make existing tugs any safer from the kind of fire that the Scandia experienced in this accident. 11. Because the Scandia's fire pump could not be started from outside the engineroom, it could not be used for fighting this fire. 12. The large difference in the oil pollution data for tug-barge systems and tankers quite likely resulted from the discrepancy in risk mitigation regulations that apply to them.   Conclusions  57  13. The Coast Guard officer-on-duty and the coxswain did not consider the weather and sea conditions sufficiently in selecting the rescue boat, and the result was a 20-minute delay in arriving on scene. 14. Had the surface swimmer been properly attired, he probably would not have become hypothermic. 15. Although the coxswain, the Coast Guard boat crew, and the tug crew volunteers made an heroic attempt to prevent an oil spill, the decision to allow them to do so was illconceived and not justified. 16. Developing and implementing risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface search and rescue units that are similar to the guidelines for the deployment of aircraft would enhance the quality of risk assessments by Coast Guard operational commanders. 17. The coxswain's decision to leave after asking for a rescue helicopter for the stranded crewman was reasonable, considering his need to protect his own crew and vessel and his inability to retrieve the crewman. 18. The notifications and the pollution cleanup response were adequate, considering the adverse weather following the accident.  Probable Cause The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the fire damage aboard the tug Scandia and the subsequent grounding of and pollution from the barge North Cape was the Eklof Marine Corporation's inadequate oversight of maintenance and operations aboard those vessels, which permitted a fire of unknown origin to become catastrophic and eliminated any realistic possibility of arresting the subsequent drift and grounding of the barge. Contributing to the accident was the lack of adequate Coast Guard and industry standards addressing towing vessel safety.   58  Recommendations As a result of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the following safety recommendations: to the U.S. Coast Guard: Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to develop risk mitigation regulations for tug-barge systems that provide a level of safety against marine pollution equivalent to that provided by regulations for tankers. (M-98-103) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry, develop and implement an effective safety management code to ensure adequate management oversight of the maintenance and operation of vessels involved in oil transportation by barges. (M-98-104) Require towing vessel companies to develop and implement procedures whereby management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. (M-98-105) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry, develop and implement requirements for voyage planning standards and checklists for towing vessel companies to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. (M-98-106) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry in the northeastern United States, institute a pilot project to evaluate the benefits of using an organized tug-assistance system to complement the proposed barge retrieval system or, if appropriate, develop and implement an alternative system to ensure barge retrieval if a tug becomes incapable of performing that function. (M-98-107) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry, develop modern remote anchor release devices for barges in emergencies that do not expose crewmen to unnecessary risk, and require their utilization. (M-98-108) Require self-contained breathing apparatus and firesuits aboard all towing vessels, as well as training in their use. (M-98-109) Require approved fixed firefighting systems in the enginerooms of existing towing vessels.

(M-98-111) Require that towing vessels have muster lists, drills on the use of selfcontained breathing apparatus and fireman's outfits, and safety orientations to familiarize crewmembers with their vessel before sailing. (M-98-112) Require vessel owners to keep detailed, signed logs of all on-board drills to assist the Coast Guard in its spot checks. (M-98-113) Require Coast Guard station search and rescue personnel to conduct a mandatory pre-deployment briefing for all search and rescue missions to ensure that the on-scene weather and sea conditions are assessed accurately so that the proper rescue boat is selected. (M-98-114) Establish and implement procedures to require a pre-designated swimmer to don suitable thermal protective clothing before launching in a small boat on a search and rescue mission in cold water. (M-98-115) Develop and implement risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface search and rescue units similar to the guidelines published in Coast Guard Commandant's Instruction 3710. (M-98-116) to Eklof Marine Corporation: Develop and implement an effective management oversight program that provides maintenance managers with enough information to track maintenance trends and to make informed maintenance decisions that will ensure the safety of the company's fleet and crews. (M-98-117) Develop and implement procedures whereby designated management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. (M-98-118) Develop and implement voyage planning procedures and checklists for your towing vessels to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. (M-98-119) to American Waterways Operators, Inc.: Develop an effective safety management code for your member companies to implement to ensure adequate management oversight of the maintenance and operation of vessels involved in oil transportation by barges. (M-98-120)   Recommendations  60  Encourage your member towing vessel companies to develop and implement voyage planning standards and checklists to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of the operational precautions. (M-99-121) In cooperation with the Coast Guard, develop a means of releasing anchors on unmanned towed barges by remote control from the towing vessel. (M-98-122) BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD  JAMES E. HALL Chairman ROBERT T. FRANCIS II Vice Chairman  JOHN A. HAMMERSCHMIDT Member JOHN J. GOGLIA Member GEORGE W. BLACK, JR. Member  July 14, 1998  Vice Chairman Robert T. Francis submitted the following statement: I have concurred in the probable cause of this accident because I believe it adequately addresses the chain of events that ultimately led to the fire aboard the tug Scandia and the subsequent grounding of the Scandia and the tank barge North Cape. However, I can not concur in our criticism of the U.S. Coast Guard coxswain of Station Point Judith for his choice of the 41-foot utility boat for the initial response for the rescue of the crewmembers of the Scandia. The report acknowledges valid reasons for the coxswain's initial choicethe utility boat was significantly faster, more maneuverable, and offered greater protection from the weather for the crew and, presumably, for the six rescued passengers from the Scandia tug. According to our investigation, the multi-mission, 41-foot utility boat is used most often to perform most missions, although the 44-foot motor life boat is available for more difficult sea conditions. The coxswain's decision to take the faster and more agile boat to rescue civilians in serious, life-threatening and immediate danger comported not only with the experience of the coxswain and station command, but also with the Coast Guard's procedures for deploying the appropriate boatprocedures that the Safety Board finds to be ""adequate.""   Recommendations  61  Of necessity, our accident investigation process reviews actions taken in such incidents with 20-20 hindsight, which enables the Safety Board to make considered decisions and thoughtful recommendations. However, I can not concur in the use of this distant and cool review to criticize the coxswain's decisions made under immediate, urgent, and critical circumstances on which the lives of the crew of the Scandia depended. The coxswain could have been better informed about the current weather and sea conditions before he left Station Point Judith. Yet, his decisions, the assembly of the duty boat crew, and the launch for the rescue operation all occurred within approximately 5 minutes. I am reluctant to criticize that sort of timeliness where lives are at stake. And, while outcome-determinative analysis is not desirable for Safety Board investigations, this mission was successfulthe crew of the Scandia was rescued and the crew of the Station Point Judith 44-foot motor life boat all returned to the station despite the 20minute delay to return to the station for the 44-foot motor life boat. The Coast Guard performs the difficult and dangerous job of search and rescue admirably. For the Coast Guard, the answer to the question of initiating a search and rescue operation on our Nation's waters is not ""whether"" but ""when."" I want to ensure that our investigation and report here do not discourage prudent, courageous action or dampen the enthusiasm and commitment of those who choose to serve in the U.S. Coast Guard.   this page intentionally left blank   63  Appendix The National Transportation Safety Board was notified of this accident on January 19, 1996. Four investigators from the Safety Board's Washington, D.C., headquarters were dispatched to the scene, arriving on January 20. Investigators met with representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, with local emergency response agencies, and with the operator of the Scandia and arranged to board the grounded tug as soon as possible. Sworn testimony was taken from the crew of the Scandia and from relevant Coast Guard personnel between January 22 and January 25. The barge North Cape was boarded and examined after the pollution abatement activities were completed and the vessel had been towed to a safe location. The initial on-scene investigation was completed on January 26. Eklof Marine Corporation (EMC) (operator of the Scandia and the North Cape) and the U.S. Coast Guard were parties in the investigation. The Safety Board investigated the accident under the authority of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1997 under Safety Board rules. In September 1997, the EMC and affiliates, the president of the EMC, and the captain of the Scandia pled guilty to a series of State and Federal criminal charges of having been negligent in the operation of the Scandia and its tow. The pleas were the culmination of a coordinated criminal investigation involving the U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Attorney General, in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Coast Guard participated. Those who pled guilty admitted that the firefighting apparatus was inadequate, that operating the tow without a serviceable anchor had jeopardized safe operation, and that the vessels had been poorly maintained and operated in weather for which they were unfit. Additionally, they admitted to giving misleading information to Safety Board investigators. The Safety Board's investigation was deferred until the defendants were sentenced in January 1998, after which additional testimony was obtained from the EMC. The EMC agreed to pay $8.5 million in fines for spilling oil and causing substantial harm to the marine environment. In addition, the EMC agreed to undertake the following $1 million remedial safety program:   Install Coast Guard-approved, remotely operated, fixed CO2 fire suppression systems in the enginerooms of its tugs and tankers. Equip each towing vessel with two fireman's outfits and SCBAs and start a company program to train and periodically drill its vessel captains and crews in the proper use of firefighting equipment.   Appendix  64     Install operable anchors and windlasses on all its barges. Accept a court-approved consultant to oversee the implementation of these measures.  In February 1998, the EMC told Safety Board investigators that, in addition to implementing the directives ordered by the courts, the company is in the process of setting up a personal computer-based system that will keep records of vessel maintenance and repairs in the future. In February 1998, the Safety Board resumed its investigation by re-interviewing EMC personnel about vessel maintenance. No ""at risk"" testimony on vessel maintenance obtained in January 1996 has been used in this report. Only those parts of eyewitness testimony from the crew that were not contradicted by information from other sources have been retained in this report. Use of eyewitness testimony was necessary for describing the sequence of accident events and for maintaining continuity in the report. The use of the eyewitness testimony did not affect the validity of the analysis in this report. The report is based on the information developed as a result of the investigation and on additional analysis done by the Safety Board. The Safety Board has considered all facts in the investigative record that are pertinent to the Board's statutory responsibility to determine the cause or probable cause of the accident and to make recommendations.   65  Acronyms and Abbreviations  AB able-bodied seaman ABS American Bureau of Shipping AST Atlantic Strike Team AWO American Waterways Operators air station Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod CBBT Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel CFR Code of Federal Regulations DEM Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management EMC Eklof Marine Corporation EPA Environmental Protection Agency FleetWeather FleetWeather Ocean Services FOSC Federal on-scene coordinator IMO International Martime Organization ISM International Safety Management MLB motor life boat MMD merchant mariner's document MRO medical review officer NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NPRM notice of proposed rulemaking NWS National Weather Service OD officer-on-duty OIC officer-in-charge OPA 90 Oil Pollution Act of 1990 POLREPs pollution response and notification activities RCP responsible carrier program RRAT regional risk assessment team SAR search and rescue SCBA self-contained breathing apparatus SITREP situation report SMIBs safety marine information broadcasts station Coast Guard Station Point Judith TOS tug of opportunity system   Acronyms and Abbreviations  66  TSAC UTB UTV VIP  Towing Safety Advisory Committee utility boat uninspected towing vessel vessel inspection program"
GX010-49-11768728	Final Recommendations To The Commissioner           Bureau of Motor Vehicles   Driver Evaluation Task Force       Testing Procedures and Screening Protocols for Detecting Impairments That Affect Driver Performance      Submitted August 24, 1999   Alvin Hayes, Chair        Background and Summary    In February, 1999, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Gary A. Gibson announced the formation of the BMV Driver Evaluation Task Force. The task force was created to review existing laws and regulatory procedures for the purpose of recommending modifications that will enable the Bureau to more accurately detect the presence of an impairment that could affect a person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle. Task force members were guided by the Commissioner’s preference for policies that are age neutral. This report contains the final recommendations from the BMV Driver Evaluation Task Force.  The task force met seven times between February 24 and July 3, 1999. During its five-month tenure, the task force reviewed regulatory protocols from driver licensing agencies in Indiana and other states. The panel solicited opinions and research from leading experts in the fields of optometry, psychology, geriatric medicine, physical therapy and other relevant disciplines. As well, task force members reviewed statistical data and reports from state, federal and private traffic safety agencies.  Following its review of relevant information, the task force debated a variety of recommendations to be offered to the commissioner. The issue of age-based testing or screening methods divided the group. All proposals involving age-based testing or screening were decided by slim margins and nearly all proposals using age-based criteria were defeated. After consideration of the recommendations, members approved five proposals. These proposals represent a significant departure from previous BMV policies in that they avoid using age-based qualifying criteria.  The task force expressed interest in new testing protocols and procedures that are being tested in other states. During several task force presentations, cognitive testing and initial screening protocols were presented as alternatives to traditional evaluation tools. While members found these new methods to be worthy of serious consideration, the task force concluded more testing is needed to verify that these screening tools are reliable in a field office environment.  Task force recommendations are subject to review and approval by the commissioner.  In August, 1999 the Bureau will allow Indiana citizens to comment on the task force recommendations during public hearings to be held in Indianapolis, South Bend and Evansville, Indiana. These hearings will assist the Commissioner in assessing public opinion. Once the Commissioner completes his review of the task force recommendations and comments expressed during the public hearings, the following steps will be required to enact any or all of the proposals:      Adoption by the Commissioner;     Promulgation of rules and regulations by the Bureau where a proposal is permitted under the Indiana Code; or     Approval by the Indiana General Assembly, if a proposal is not currently authorized under the Indiana Code.                Policy Recommendations    TERMINATION OF AGE-BASED DRIVE TESTS -  The task force recommended that the Bureau  should not  reinstate its requirement that Indiana driver license renewal applicants aged 75 and older take a driver skills test. This procedure was discontinued on December 5, 1998, after the Commissioner released a finding that neither the Indiana Code nor the Indiana Administrative Code grants authority to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to require testing for a driver license renewal applicant based on that person’s age.  Opinions were nearly evenly divided regarding the issue of age-based testing. A majority of task force members favored discontinuing age-based testing because of the following factors:      Americans Leading Longer, Healthier Lives . Improvements in health care, pharmaceuticals, and other quality of life factors have delayed the onset of physical and mental impairments that could negatively affect driver performance.      Low Drive Test Failure Rate.  Fewer than 10 percent of driver license renewal applicants fail the driver skills test. A majority of task force members concluded that the low failure rate indicated that the skills test is unnecessary in a majority of cases. BMV driver examiners told the task force that failure rates do not show significant change until a driver reaches 85 years of age.      Improvements in Testing, Screening Techniques.  There are increasing numbers of researchers who are developing new testing procedures, screening protocols and technology that can be applied by driver licensing agencies to determine driver fitness. These screening tools are gaining acceptance among leading state and federal driving regulators as being reliable and accurate predictors of driver impairments. As a result, task force members consider it preferable for the Bureau to conduct driver impairment screening procedures where advisable in lieu of mandatory driver skills tests, with age as the sole qualifying criteria.      Age-Based Testing Not Fair.  Some members oppose age as a qualifying factor for screening drivers as age is not a reliable predictor of driving ability, in their opinion. Although drivers ages 75 and older may be overrepresented among persons involved in traffic collisions, an individual driver should not be categorized based on a statistical category.     A minority of task force members opposed the prevailing recommendation regarding age-based drive testing. Those members expressed the following concerns:          Risk of Driver Impairments Increase With Driver Age  The minority task force view holds that age is not a predictor of driver performance, but as there is no method available for the Bureau to proactively screen drivers for impairments prior to a collision or other incident, age-based skills tests will prevent accidents.      Accident Rates -  State and federal statistics indicate that drivers over age 75 have the highest collision rates of any age group except for persons under age 21.         REQUIRE DRIVE TESTING BASED ON DRIVER PERFORMANCE -  The task force voted to replace age-based testing with a screening procedure that is based on driver performance. This recommendation requires any driver, regardless of age, to submit to a drive test after exceeding an unspecified number of accidents, driver license points or traffic convictions. By adopting this requirement, the task force would establish a new state policy that makes operator performance as the primary criteria that requires a driver to submit to the Bureau’s screening and evaluation process.  This proposal was presented as a counterproposal to the Bureau’s previous testing requirement for drivers aged 75 and older. A majority of task force members favored this type of screening criteria because it is perceived to be age-neutral and fair to all drivers. If this procedure is adopted, a commissioner’s designee (e.g., the BMV Point Study Commission) would have to establish a minimum standard for convictions, accidents and/or license points that would generate a mandatory drive test requirement prior to promulgating new regulations.  REFERRALS FROM PUBLIC WITH IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY -  Currently, the Bureau accepts written referrals from the public citing specific unsafe behavior or medical condition that poses a traffic safety risk. However, some task force members suggested that many medical professionals may not report an impairment that may affect a person’s driving ability because such action might be considered a breach of patient confidentiality.  Task force members expressed an interest in adopting measures that would increase reporting of physical and mental impairments by medical professionals. Therefore, the task force recommended the state adopt rules that would protect physicians, nurses, psychiatrists and other health workers from legal action resulting from a medical professional reporting information about a patient’s driving impairment.  ADOPT PERIPHERAL VISION STANDARD -  Adding a peripheral vision standard was the third task force recommendation. Currently, the Bureau conducts a vision screening that only measures a driver’s visual acuity. Several experts suggested that a peripheral vision standard is a necessary component for effective driver screening. This proposal was the only recommendation that was unanimously approved.  ESTABLISH TASK FORCE TO EXPLORE YOUNGER DRIVER ISSUES -  Some task force members expressed concern that the task force did not address issues specific to drivers under age 18. Factors that cause collisions in which a younger driver is involved include a lack of structured driver training, poor decision making, risk-taking behavior and driver immaturity. While the task force acknowledged that Indiana lawmakers recently approved a Probationary Driver license statute that restricts operating privileges for persons ages 16-18, members said additional measures are needed that provide training and improve decision-making capacity.  The task force suggested that a panel should be created to study critical issues involving younger drivers, which includes behavior patterns, statistical data, new technology and screening procedures, judicial and administrative policies in other states and other methods that would help the Bureau identify young problem drivers.  ESTABLISH PILOT SCREENING AND EVALUATION PROJECT -  The task force reviewed a wide variety of research projects and technology-based tools that have been designed to assist state agencies in screening driver licensing applicants for physical and mental impairments. Currently, none of these tools are being used for regulatory purposes by a driver licensing agency.  The only state agency that is using the new technology-based screening tools is Maryland’s Motor Vehicle Administration. The agency is participating in a pilot project, sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is designed to test the validity of the screening and evaluation tools in a license branch environment. To date, no information is available regarding the success of the pilot project, and which, if any, of the screening and evaluation tools should be used.  However, task force members agreed that the Bureau should conduct its own pilot study to measure the effectiveness of screening and evaluation tools. The task force suggested that the pilot project should be conducted based on the following criteria:       The study should be conducted for a period of two years;      Persons ages 75 and older should be required to participate in the study;      Normal regulatory provisions would be applicable to the results of an applicant’s screening procedure (e.g., if a possible impairment is discovered, the applicant would have to submit to a driver skill test or a physician would be required to provide a report regarding the applicant’s condition. )      The project should be monitored by an independent panel of physicians and scientists.
GX107-69-16304086	"Testimony of   Jim Hall, Chairman   National Transportation Safety Board   before the   Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure   Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation   House of Representatives   Regarding   Coast Guard Search and Rescue Communications   November 3, 1999         Good morning Chairman Gilchrest and members of the Committee.  It is a pleasure to represent the National Transportation Safety Board before you today regarding the subject of Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) communications.       The Coast Guard’s 1998 Annual Report states that ""The Coast Guard seeks to save all mariners in imminent danger.""  And, they have a good record of achieving that goal.  In 1998, the Coast Guard responded to approximately 38,700 distress calls and saved more than 4,000 lives.  However, in December 1997, the distress call from the 34-foot recreational sailing vessel  Morning Dew  was not responded to, and the lives of the four individuals aboard were not saved.  The Safety Board’s investigation of that accident found serious deficiencies in the Coast Guard’s communication system.  My testimony will focus on those findings and our recommendations to correct the problems we found.     In addition to the accident involving the  Morning Dew,  the Safety Board has investigated five additional marine accidents involving Coast Guard communications since 1993.        August 4, 1993  – At 12:08 a.m., the operator of the sailing vessel  Rite of Passage  notified the Coast Guard that the vessel was disabled near the Isle of Palms, South Carolina, with engine problems and that he needed assistance.  Believing that the operator was in no immediate danger, the watchstander classified the incident as a non-distress situation, issued a marine assistance request, and a local towing company advised that they would respond.  At 1:00 a.m., the Coast Guard received a telephone call from the Isle of Palms Police Department reporting that an unidentified sailing vessel was aground and listing badly.  The Coast Guard then dispatched a 41-foot utility boat to respond to what was thought to be a second vessel in distress. At 5:50 a.m., a local rescue squad recovered the operator’s body from the surf.  If the watchstander had asked the operator the questions on the SAR checklist, he would have learned that the operator was a 67-year-old man with a heart condition requiring medication, and may have increased the urgency of the situation and indicated a need for an immediate Coast Guard response.     August 21, 1994  – A disabled 18-foot Questar motorboat with the vessel’s owner and one passenger on board capsized while being towed by the Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel  Puppet  near Juneau, Alaska, resulting in one fatality.  Events surrounding this accident suggest that the SAR response was hampered by the undisciplined use of VHF-FM channel 16 by participants in a fishing derby.  The Safety Board found that the Coast Guard made no attempt to minimize inappropriate use of channel 16 by the approximately 1,000 vessels participating in the fishing derby.  The sheer volume of inappropriate radio traffic on a channel that was supposed to be reserved for calling out and distress severely compromised the Coast Guard’s ability to receive and respond to distress calls.  As a result of this accident, the Safety Board issued recommendations to the Coast Guard regarding radio reception capability, the use of Coast Guard Auxiliary resources, SAR policies, and post-accident toxicological testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel.       April 14, 1995  – An 18-foot-long Thunderbird Cheyenne motorboat capsized in about 16 feet of water, in Oswego, New York, resulting in the deaths of all three occupants.  Another boater saw the capsized vessel and reported the sighting and the location to someone at a local marina.  The marina operator called Coast Guard Station Oswego and relayed the report.  The watchstander at Station Oswego notified the duty officer of the call, but the duty officer decided that no immediate action should be taken.  The boat was found the next day by a local law enforcement marine patrol boat after the boat was reported overdue.     June 13, 1998  – A distress call from the recreational boat  Florida Air Specialist,  which was in Apalachee Bay, Florida, for recreational fishing with three people on board ,  was logged by Coast Guard Auxiliary watchstanders as a hoax.  The Coast Guard did not initiate a review of the recorded radio communications until after the only survivor of the accident reported that a distress call had been transmitted.  Had no one survived the  Florida Air  accident, the Coast Guard may not have known that the distress call had been made.  The investigation into this accident is on going.     January 18, 1999  – About noon, the  Adriatic , with four people on board, completed clam harvesting operations and began the trip from the fishing grounds off the coast of Long Beach Island, New Jersey to Atlantic City, New Jersey.  At about 2:58 p.m., the operator radioed a mayday to the Coast Guard.  Watchstanders from three units converged onto the airwaves all within the first few seconds, overlapping one another.  In addition, another Coast Guard unit made an unscheduled marine information broadcast at the same moment the call outs were initiated.   All four people are missing from this vessel.  The Board’s investigation is on going.     Like these accidents, the  Morning Dew  tragedy involved Coast Guard communications.  The Safety Board was first informed about this accident in April 1998, when several Members of Congress asked that we conduct an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident, and to review the Coast Guard's actions following the accident.  I want to point out that under our current agreement with the Coast Guard, we were not initially informed about the accident because it did not meet the notification criteria.      As a result of the Congressional requests, we proceeded to conduct an extensive marine accident investigation.  More than 35 witnesses were interviewed, and extensive factual information was gathered from the Coast Guard, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), the Charleston Pilots Association, the Charleston Coroner, and family members of the victims.  We also contracted with the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center to survey the communications system serving Coast Guard Group Charleston, including two subordinate stations and six antenna high sites stretching from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Savannah, Georgia.  The Navy also transcribed more than 300 hours of radio and telephone communications recorded at the Charleston station.  In addition, the Board held a public hearing in Charleston in February 1999.  The final report was discussed at the October 5, 1999, Board meeting.     The Accident Investigation     The owner of the  Morning Dew  was moving the vessel from a marina near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, via the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), and had purchased the appropriate charts for that trip.  The group on board, comprised of the owner, his two sons, ages 16 and 13, and his 14-year-old nephew, got underway a little after noon on December 27, 1997.   On the afternoon of December 28, 1997, in Winya Bay, South Carolina, the  Morning Dew  was seen proceeding outbound in the main shipping channel, past the entrance to the ICW, and toward the open ocean.      In order for the  Morning Dew  to exit the bay and reach the open ocean, it had to continue in or near the shipping channel for about seven miles, during which time the boat would pass 12 or more channel markers before reaching the mouth of the bay.  Once there, the vessel had to navigate past a 2.2-mile-long jetty before turning right to follow a southwesterly course, along the coast, toward Charleston, South Carolina, about 43 miles away.       From all available evidence, just after 2:00 a.m., the  Morning Dew  struck the north side of the north rock jetty extending from the harbor at Charleston.  The paint markings and debris path documented by the SCDNR show that the vessel was carried over the jetty, probably by waves in combination with the rising tide, resulting in the vessel’s coming to rest submerged in about 12 feet of water on the south side of the jetty.       At 2:17 a.m., a Coast Guard Group Charleston communications watchstander received a static-filled radio message -- the only words he heard were ""U.S. Coast Guard.""  Although he tried to raise someone on the radio, he received no response.  Despite having the capability to do so, the watchstander did not replay the recording of the message to determine the nature of the call, nor did he wake his duty officer.  Much later, when the tape was finally replayed, the voice of an excited adolescent male was heard saying ""May ... mayday, U.S. Coast Guard come in.""        About 6:20 a.m., the boatswain of the inbound freighter  Pearl Ace  reported hearing cries for help coming from the water near buoy 22 as the ship entered Charleston Harbor. He immediately reported it by radio to the master on the bridge, and the pilot in turn contacted the pilot dispatcher and asked him to relay the information to the Coast Guard.  The pilot also asked the operator of the pilot boat  Palmetto State  to search the area where the calls for help had been heard.  The search by the  Palmetto State  was unsuccessful.     When the Coast Guard duty officer was contacted regarding the cries for help he decided to take no action, even though Coast Guard resources were available to initiate a search.  He later told investigators that he thought the pilot boat could handle the situation.      A full Coast Guard search was not initiated until the bodies of two teenagers were discovered near the beach about 11:00 a.m. The other teenager was found soon after, and the owner was not found until about three weeks later.     Following the accident, the SCDNR initiated a death and boating safety investigation.  Despite an SCDNR request to the Coast Guard regarding possible distress calls, the Coast Guard was not forthcoming with information because they were conducting an administrative investigation into the watchstander's actions.  In fact, although Coast Guard officials were aware of the mayday call on the evening of December 29, 1997, no one outside the Coast Guard, including the SCDNR or the victims' families, was told about it for more than 2 1/2 months.  That failure hampered the SCDNR's investigation. The information regarding the distress call was not released by the Coast Guard until  Boating News  filed a Freedom of Information Act request in February 1998.       Mr. Chairman, the results of the Board’s investigation of the  Morning Dew  accident were distressing, particularly with regard to the following areas:  the need to upgrade Coast Guard SAR communications equipment; the adequacy of watchstander duty time, and the need to upgrade watchstander procedures for responding to an emergency; the need for additional training for communications watchstanders; and the lack of investigation coordination.     SAR Communications      The Board’s investigation of the  Morning Dew  accident sought to evaluate the equipment resources available to the Coast Guard communication center watchstanders when they receive a call for assistance from a distressed mariner.  Specifically, we were interested in determining if the radio and recording equipment were adequate, and what means were available to the watchstander to locate a distressed boater when the boater did not or could not provide his location to the Coast Guard.  The Board contracted with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to assist in this effort.  Unfortunately, a number of significant deficiencies with the communication systems at the Charleston and Mobile group offices, the only two offices surveyed, were found, and suggested that similar problems may exist throughout the Coast Guard.  Group Mobile was studied to provide another data point, and because of its connection with the  Florida Air Specialist  accident previously mentioned.      Operational testing on the direction finding (DF) equipment at group Charleston showed it was very inaccurate, had limited features, and thus was not being used.  This DF system was designed to only provide a line of bearing to, rather than the geographic location of, the transmitting radio.  In addition, it could not record the bearing information for later review and correlation to recorded audio transmissions.        The Navy’s assessment of the communication system included an evaluation of the audio recording equipment used in the Coast Guard’s communication centers.  We found that the recorders in use at Charleston and Mobile were difficult to operate when searching for specific recorded communications.  In addition, the recorders were not suitable for quickly replaying recently received messages.        Some antennas and towers needed maintenance, and there was no program to specifically inspect antenna towers.  A continuous frequency swept voltage standing wave ratio measurement, which can be used to document antenna bandwidth and identify nulls, had not been performed on the antennas.  The antenna at Mount Pleasant, which picked up the  Morning Dew  transmission, was found to be located on a tower along with several other commercial antennas, and tests found some interference from these other antennas at certain frequencies.  The noise levels on the telephone lines connecting the Charleston Group Communications Center to the antenna high sites were not being routinely monitored, and the quality of the telephone lines used to connect the group communications centers to the antenna high sites were less than optimum.     As a result of their findings, the Naval Surface Warfare Center recommended the following improvements to optimize the efficiency of the communication system:        Institute a programmed antenna maintenance program that would improve the early detection of faults;         Institute a frequency management program to reduce the possibility of signal interference from other transmitters;         Install a condition-based monitoring system that would provide continuous monitoring of remote equipment; and         Upgrade the class of telephone service to reduce the possibility of signal degradation through the existing phone lines.       Safety Board staff visited the Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada for information about Canadian Coast Guard SAR communications.  We learned that the Prince Rupert radio station has been successfully using a commercially available DF system in SAR operations since 1992.  The Prince Rupert Station is one of three Canadian Marine Communications and Traffic Services stations that have radio DF equipment for use in SAR  cases.  These off-the-shelf commercial DF systems are reasonably priced and are currently being manufactured by several companies in the United States and elsewhere.       The officer-in-charge reported that the Canadian DF system is easy to use, accurate, and  capable of determining the geographic location of a transmitting radio to a distance of sixty to eighty miles through triangulation.  The system can also digitally record bearing information for later retrieval and analysis.  According to the Canadian Coast Guard, the DF system has reduced SAR response time by eliminating time-consuming searches for vessels in distress.  As soon as the station receives a transmission, it also knows the vessel’s location.  The system can locate vessels in distress when incomplete maydays are transmitted, and can provide navigation information to vessels lost in fog, and locate vessels with open microphones.  Because the equipment can also identify and locate a hoax caller, it has reduced nuisance calls and unnecessary SAR missions, resulting in a cost savings.      The Prince Rupert Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station also has recording equipment to record all incoming and outgoing radio communications.  The recording equipment consists of separate units for instant playback and for longer term archival recording. Unlike the equipment at Group Charleston, it allows for quick replay of a message if there is any doubt about its content.      The Safety Board is aware of the U.S. Coast Guard’s national distress and response system modernization project, which has been in various stages of development for 20 years.   Unfortunately, the initial operational capability is not scheduled until fiscal year 2003, and full operational capability will not be until the 2005-2006 timeframe.  In the interim, the Coast Guard intends to install new DF equipment at selected communication centers in areas having significant SAR activity, and has allocated $2 million in fiscal year 2000 for the procurement of the equipment.       It is our understanding that the interim DF equipment will be similar to equipment now in place at communication centers, and will only provide a line of bearing to the transmitting vessel and will not likely have the ability to record the DF data.  The Board believes that this equipment will not significantly improve the Coast Guard’s SAR response capability.      Therefore, the Safety Board adopted a recommendation requesting that the Coast Guard immediately provide all SAR communications centers with the capability for watchstanders to easily and instantly replay the most recent recorded radio transmissions, and that they immediately begin to equip all SAR communications centers with currently available, commercial, off-the-shelf DF systems that provide, at a minimum, the capability to establish a position fix and to record position data for later retrieval and analysis.     Group Charleston’s Personnel Duty Time, Equipment, and Procedures for Responding to an Emergency      The Board expressed concern that current Coast Guard duty policy does not provide redundancy for listening to communications.  Such a procedure is typical during the night, for example, when the operations duty officer is sleeping.     At the time of the  Morning Dew  accident, a newly qualified and inexperienced communications watchstander was on duty, alone, for 6 to 8 hours, and it was during this time that he failed to detect the word ""mayday"" in the 2:17 a.m. transmission and consequently  misidentified the call.     In addition, the Coast Guard is currently operating under an interim staffing policy, pending the results of an analysis of workload and staffing of all group and activity functions, that codifies practices in existence at the time of the  Morning Dew’s  sinking.  It permits communications watchstanders to work 12-hour shifts and sets a supervisory ratio of 1-to-5 for each watchstanding position.      In many communications centers, including Group Charleston, there is only one communications position; thus, the watchstander always stands a solo watch.  This leaves watchstanders with no backup if they need to use the restroom; are unable to sustain attention or wakefulness; or benefit from a ""second opinion"" in the case of an unclear call, a unique situation, or concurrent SAR cases.     While the 12-hour watch duration may facilitate scheduling, the Board does not feel it adequately considers the watchstander’s ability to perform.  Work schedules must not only ensure that duty positions are covered at all times, they must ensure that continuous vigilance by watchstanders is possible and feasible.  They must also take into account the need for oversight and supervision of novice watchstanders, so that sleep loss and fatigue do not degrade performance.  Sleep loss has immense potential to exacerbate the problems of excessive shift length, monotony, and boredom. Coast Guard telecommunications specialists endure long hours of tedium, make routine radio broadcasts, perform routine administrative tasks, and listen to a drone of routine radio chatter.  Without a mechanism for effectively monitoring their performance, a 12-hour watch can result in decreased alertness and diminished vigilance.       The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should develop permanent staffing policies that would require redundancy to monitor incoming radio traffic.  This would provide oversight and supervision of relatively inexperienced watchstanders, have a backup in evaluating incoming radio calls, and generally provide redundancy in the overall listening and decision-making process.  As a result, we adopted a recommendation that asks the Coast Guard to ensure that the workload and staffing analysis contracted with the Center for Naval Analysis fully incorporates existing human performance research on vigilance, attention, and fatigue in the determination of shift length, shift rotation, and staffing levels at all Coast Guard SAR communications centers.     Communications Center Watchstander Training     The Board’s investigation of the  Morning Dew  also examined the training received by the communications center watchstander on duty at the time of the accident.  Since his entire experience as a communications watchstander at the time of the accident consisted of 6 months’ duty at Group Charleston, we were particularly interested in whether his training adequately prepared him for the position.       Regular Coast Guard communications watchstanders attend a 10-week telecommunications school, during which they learn the operation of various communications equipment, radiotelephone protocols, and procedures for handling different types of communications, including distress messages.  After completing the formal classroom training, they must complete the  Group and Stations Communications Watchstander Qualification Guide  and on-the-job training at their assigned communications center.  The guide contains five divisions of qualification tasks comprising reading assignments and a number of tasks in each of the 22 divisions to be completed and practiced in sequence by the student, with the help of the instructor.  Once candidate watchstanders complete the local on-the-job training, they are required to pass an oral examination by a qualifications review board before they are considered qualified to stand watch unsupervised.     The communications watchstander on duty at the time of the accident had completed on-the-job training on the qualification guide in 3 to 4 weeks, and spent only 20 to 30 minutes before his oral qualification review board.  In order to complete his guide in 4 weeks, the candidate watchstander had to complete and master more than 4 to 6 tasks weekly, including completing the associated reading assignments.       The Safety Board believes that novice watchstanders should be provided with ample opportunity to practice what they were taught during their formal schooling and on-the-job training, and to demonstrate a suitable level of proficiency before they are deemed qualified to stand watch.       In addition, the current focus of the training for communications watchstanders is on the proper operation of hardware and the use of standardized responses to typical situations.  However, communications watchstanders do not handle only typical situations.  They also encounter atypical situations that require them to use analytical skills to make judgments and formulate decisions that may have life-and-death implications.  For example, the watchstander in the  Morning Dew  accident failed to take into account such factors as the urgency in the voice of the caller, the time of night, and the prevailing weather when he concluded that the 2:17 a.m. call from the vessel did not require action.  Similarly, in regard to the report of cries from the water, the operations duty officer at Group Charleston did not take into account the nature of the report, the credibility of those making the report, or the potential effectiveness of the pilot boat when he allowed that vessel to conduct an independent search even though Coast Guard resources were available.     The Safety Board adopted a safety recommendation to the Coast Guard that calls for implementation of a course or training program for all operations and communications center watchstanders designed to develop or enhance those individuals’ judgment and decision-making skills.     Investigation Coordination     Because of questions raised in the months after the  Morning Dew  accident regarding investigation coordination, this issue was of interest to the Board.  Throughout the initial response to the accident, the SCNDR, the coroner, and local agencies participated in an Incident Command System (ICS) that allowed them to effectively manage their personnel, resources, and communications.       The ICS allows different agencies with d operating procedures to work together in one system to accomplish a common goal.  The ICS also reduces the duplication of effort and the burden that can be placed on people involved in an accident investigation who must obtain similar information from different parties.  The fact that the Coast Guard did not participate in this system resulted in a lack of coordination between the Coast Guard and local agencies.  For example:        Both the coroner and the Coast Guard needed information from the families of the deceased.  The Coast Guard needed to know how many people had been on the vessel, and the coroner needed to establish their identities and made death notifications.  Had the Coast Guard participated in the ICS, Coast Guard representatives would have been aware of the coroner’s procedures, and the process would have been much better coordinated.         The SCDNR investigator-in-charge arrived on scene and was told that the Coast Guard had already requested that a commercial salvage operator send divers to identify the name on the sailboat.  The SCDNR investigator-in-charge, wanting to preserve any evidence in case of a criminal investigation, had to tell the divers not to disturb any of the evidence.  The preservation of evidence should have been discussed before divers were deployed.         Although a Coast Guard representative was in telephonic contact with an SCDNR representative and police officials during different phases of the response, the absence of a Coast Guard representative at the command post where decisions were being made resulted in the Coast Guard representative’s not being able to efficiently track the progress being made in the joint investigation or to answer any questions.  In addition, he was not able to provide information known to the Coast Guard that may have facilitated the SCDNR investigation.  For example, the investigator-in-charge learned from the newspaper about a witness who saw the  Morning Dew  and about the reports to the Coast Guard of a boatswain hearing cries from the water.       The problems in coordination that arose during this accident could have been avoided if the Coast Guard, the SCNDR, and local responders had used a system that allowed them to manage a joint SAR operation.  Therefore, the Safety Board adopted a recommendation that asks the Coast Guard to implement a program whereby Coast Guard emergency response personnel participate in drills with local agencies within their area of responsibility in order to exercise their role in the incident command structure, and gain experience in using the incident command system.      When reviewing the initial accident investigation coordination, the Board was distressed to learn that the commanding officer of Group Charleston was unaware of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Coast Guard and the State, even though it had been in place since 1984.  The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 specified that cooperative agreements between the Coast Guard and each of the states within the district’s area of responsibility be in place to foster cooperation between State and Federal governments in reducing deaths, injuries, and property damage from recreational boating accidents.  These agreements usually cover such subject areas as law enforcement, public education and training, boating casualty reporting and investigative reports, SAR, aids to navigation, and use of the Coast Guard Auxiliary.     Although the agreement between the Coast Guard and the State of South Carolina had been reviewed in 1994, personnel changes have occurred in both the state agencies and the Coast Guard, and telephone numbers and points of contact may also have changed.  Coast Guard Headquarters issued a message to all district commanders in February 1999 directing a review of all existing agreements or MOUs between the districts and other agencies within their areas of responsibility.  The guidance, however, did not provide a timeframe for the completion of the reviews, nor did it provide for follow-up periodic review and updating, which is necessary to ensure that the agreements are kept current.        The Board Members have asked staff to draft safety recommendations to the Coast Guard and the Governors of the 50 states to review and revise, within 6 months and at least biannually thereafter, all boating safety agreements between the Coast Guard and the States to ensure that those agreements are coordinated between local Coast Guard authorities and the appropriate agencies within the States and accurately reflect current responsibilities and jurisdictions of each entity in such areas as boating casualty accident investigation and reporting, SAR, and related boating safety issues.        The Safety Board believes that if the commanding officer of Group Charleston had knowledge of the agreement and its provisions, the coordination between the Coast Guard and the SCDNR in the aftermath of the accident may have been significantly improved.      Mr. Chairman, it is noteworthy that the  Morning Dew  investigation did not identify the actual search by Coast Guard boat and helicopter crews as an issue in this accident.  Once the SAR was initiated, it proceeded well.  But, in order for an SAR to take place, Coast Guard communications and operations personnel must receive, acknowledge, and act upon a distress situation.  In the case of the  Morning Dew , this did not occur until after the Coast Guard was notified by the Sullivans Island Police Department that bodies were discovered near the beach 11:15 a.m. on December 29, 1997, some eight  hours after the first mayday call from the vessel.        We recognize that over the last few years the Coast Guard has had its budget and personnel significantly reduced, and still maintained its high level of response to distress calls and lives saved.  However, we believe the Coast Guard should reexamine its priorities and make the necessary investment in infrastructure and personnel that will help ensure the safety of Americans on our waterways.  We believe rapid action in response to our safety recommendations by the Coast Guard will prevent the recurrence similar accidents.      Mr. Chairman that completes my statement and I will be happy to respond to whatever questions the Committee may have."
GX239-96-14995035	"CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY REVIEW FALL 1998 VOL. 3, NO. 1  Fast-Track Recalls U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Ann Brown, Chairman Mary Sheila Gall, Commissioner Thomas H. Moore, Commissioner  Recalling dangerous products from the marketplace is one of the most important responsibilities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). And CPSC's efforts to improve this process -- with its fast-track consumer product recall program -- were recently recognized nationally. (See box below.) No company likes to recall one of its products. But when a safety problem makes a product recall necessary to prevent injuries and save lives, it is to everyone's benefit to move quickly. The CPSC fast-track product recall program speeds up the recall process and gets more dangerous products out of people's homes. This saves industry and government both time and money, and reduces the potential for injuries and deaths to the public. Since CPSC instituted a pilot fast-track program in August 1995, more than 315 recalls involving about 50 million potentially defective products have been conducted. About half of CPSC's recalls are now done under this streamlined system.  How Fast-Track Works The fast-track recall program is provided for companies willing and able to move quickly with a voluntary recall of their product. The fast-track program eliminates procedural steps from the traditional recall process. This includes CPSC staff's technical evaluation of a product to determine if a defect exists that could harm consumers. This procedure, called a preliminary determination, can take several months.

The specific recall actions to be taken, including notice of the recall to consumers, distributors, and retailers, must be part of the plan. The recall process must get underway within 20 days. If CPSC staff accepts the above information, the preliminary determination is waived, and the fast-track recall proceeds.  Many Companies, Many Products All kinds of products have been included in the fasttrack recalls. For example, a major manufacturer recently recalled tens of thousands of humidifiers that could potentially overheat or catch fire. A leading manufacturer of children's products recalled tens of thousands of baby monitors that could smoke and flame. A prominent clothing retailer recalled more than 100,000 children's jackets with zipper pulls containing unacceptable levels of lead. A well-known company recalled tens of thousands of gas grills because a defective hose could leak gas or cause fires. Other fast-track recalls have included such products as computer monitors, baseball batting aids, bicycle cranks, and play equipment. Recalls for all of these products were initiated in 20 or fewer days.  the percentage of products returned has climbed to nearly 60%. This is because it is easier to effectively recall a potentially hazardous product when the problem is identified early and action is taken quickly. Manufacturers and retailers can stop sales of products and return them before the products get into consumers' homes. In addition, recalls handled under the traditional recall process at CPSC also have speeded up since the fasttrack program was implemented. With the time saved using the fast-track process, CPSC staff can spend more resources on those cases that are better handled under the traditional recall program. (See Running the Recalls, page 3.)  What's a Recall? A product recall is a generic term for removing a product from the marketplace, as well as a repair, replacement, or refund of a product. The exact form a recall takes depends on the specific problem and the specific fix. For example, some products are potentially so dangerous that they need to be taken off the market and destroyed. Other products can be made safe by a simple repair. One important benchmark of a successful recall program -- whatever remedy it entails -- is that it reaches as many people as possible who own, use, sell, or distribute the product. To that end, CPSC and companies work closely together to alert consumers, retailers, and distributors to the product recall. This usually includes a joint press release with CPSC, a point-of-purchase poster, and other notices. Among these are paid advertisements, direct mail, video news releases, website postings, posters for display at medical offices, hospitals, child care centers, and repair centers, and incentives targeted to likely product owners.  Genesis of Fast-Track Since CPSC's inception in the early 1970s, consumer product companies have been required to report product defects that could create a substantial risk of injury to CPSC. Later, Congress also required firms to report unreasonable risks of serious injury or death. In recent years, CPSC has received 250 to 300 such reports each year. Companies who do not report product defects in a timely manner could be subject to civil penalties of up to $1.5 million. For many companies, reporting such problems carried with it negative connotations, as well as opened up possible product liability issues. Many companies did not readily come forward with recall programs. Other companies willing to do recalls felt that CPSC's required preliminary determination procedure actually slowed down the process. To speed up the recall process and to offer industry an opportunity to avoid the perceived stigma of CPSC's preliminary determination of a product hazard, CPSC staff suggested a pilot fast-track process in 1995. CPSC made the pilot program permanent in 1997.

Under the fast-track process, 2   Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  Running the Recalls CPSC's Office of Compliance negotiates product recalls with industry. In an interview, Marc J. Schoem, Director of the Recalls and Compliance Division, talked about the process. What are the benefits of the fast-track product recall program? Our primary job is to reduce injuries and deaths from consumer products, and the fast-track program allows us to get dangerous products out of the marketplace and out of people's homes faster. These fast-track recalls take an average of just nine days from initial report of a problem to initiation of the recall activity. A traditional recall may take months. Why is the fast-track recall process faster than CPSC's traditional recall process? The fast-track recall program eliminates many technical steps. In a traditional recall, for example, it can take months to adequately evaluate a product to determine if there's a product defect and, if so, whether this presents a substantial risk of injury to consumers. This may lead to our preliminary determination -- or ""PD"", as we call it -- that a product has a problem. If so, companies are understandably concerned that the PD could be used against them in a product liability suit. The fast-track program eliminates the ""PD."" If companies come to us already willing to do a recall, then our staff doesn't have to spend valuable time determining whether the product has a defect. We can immediately begin working with the company to develop a recall plan to get the product out of the market. Why does CPSC still handle some recalls under the traditional process? Not all recalls lend themselves to the fast-track process. For example, we may believe a product has a problem, but the company doesn't agree with us. Another company may admit there's a problem, but hasn't identified a specific cause or can't figure out how to fix it. Some recalls are just too complex to do in 20 days. We then have to take the time to test and evaluate the product to make our case. In these instances, we'll handle the recall under our traditional process. How do you find out about products that may need to be recalled? Under the law, companies have to report product safety problems to us. If a company discovers that its product has a defect that could create a substantial hazard or presents an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, the company must let us know immediately.  Do you find out about all dangerous products this way? Unfortunately, no. Not all companies report these problems to us, even though they're supposed to. We get a lot of information from other sources -- including trade complaints, state and local governments, fire and police departments, emergency medical personnel, and from consumers who use the products. In addition, we have great resources at CPSC, including our national hospital injury database, called NEISS, and our ability to receive complaints via our telephone hotline, web site, and e-mail. If, under the fast-track recall program, you rely on the company's evaluation of a product, how do you confirm that the information is accurate? We carefully review the information the company gives us. And, it's in a company's interest to give us complete information. If not, companies could put themselves in the position of having to do a recall twice. In addition, they might subject themselves to a substantial penalty under the law for not providing accurate information. So far, we have not had any problems of this kind. What has industr y had to say about the fast-track recall program? We've had a lot of positive feedback from industry. A fast-track recall means that companies can be ""in-andout"" in 20 business days. For them, that boils down to spending less time dealing with government and more time focusing on their business. The best indication of fast-track's success is that we've had ""repeat business"" by a number of companies under this program. Overall, it's a much less adversarial process than the traditional recall program. Is there any particular type of company that benefits most from using the fast-track recall program? We've found that fast-track works for just about any kind of company. We've used it successfully with small companies that have a limited number of products in the marketplace and with major manufacturers with millions of products that need to be recalled. Any negatives to the fast-track recall program? I think it puts more pressure on CPSC staff to meet these compressed deadlines. But I also think there's a greater sense of staff satisfaction in being able to get dangerous products out of the marketplace faster. After all, the fast-track program was suggested and implemented by CPSC staffers who wanted to improve the recall process.  3   Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1998  Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  NEISS Data Highlights -- 1997 CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) collects current injury data associated with 15,000 categories of consumer products from hospital emergency departments across the country. Consisting of a national probability sample of hospitals of differing sizes and locations, NEISS provides national estimates of the number and severity of consumer product-related injuries. The 1997 NEISS estimates have been produced from an updated sample of 101 hospitals, including children's hospitals. Information from NEISS is available to the public through CPSC's National Injury Information Clearinghouse (phone: 301-504-0424).

Hosp. & DOA  * Estimated Number of Cases: Since NEISS is a probability sample, each injury case has a statistical weight. National estimates of product-related injury incidents are derived by summing the statistical weights for the appropriate injury cases. * CV (Coefficient of Variation): The CV, the standard error of the estimate divided by the estimate, is a measure of sampling variability (errors that occur by chance because observations are made only on a population sample).  * Number of Cases: This is the actual number of injury cases collected from the hospitals sampled. Since injury cases have different statistical weights, these ""raw"" numbers should not be used for comparative purposes. * Product-Related Injuries: These are national estimates of the number of persons treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments with consumer product-related injuries during the given time period. The data system allows for reporting of up to two products for each person's injury. Therefore, a person's injury may be counted in two product groups.  6   Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  Consumer Product Incident Repor t Please contact us about any injur y or death involving consumer products.

Product: About 8.4 million Omega brand fire sprinklers manufactured since 1982 by Central Sprinkler Corp. and its subsidiary Central Sprinkler Co. The sprinklers are installed in homes, schools, hospitals, dormitories, nursing homes, and many other buildings. Most recalled sprinklers have 3 flat round metal disks stacked one above the other with a small space between each disk. Problem: CPSC alleges that the sprinklers are defective and could fail in a fire. CPSC alleges that, on average, between 30% to 40% of Omegas removed from various locations across the country for testing failed to activate as they should. The recall follows the resolution of the lawsuit filed by CPSC on March 3, 1998. CPSC has reports of Omega sprinklers not functioning in 17 fires with at least four persons suffering injuries and over $4.3 million in property damage. What to do: Call 1-800-896-5685 any time or access the Omega recall website at Omegarecall.com for information about identifying recalled sprinklers and getting free replacement glass bulb sprinklers and reimbursement toward cost of removal and replacement.

No injuries have been reported. What to do: Stop using the pajama sets and return them to a Limited Too store for a full refund. Call 1-800-934-4497 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. ET Monday through Friday for information. Product: About 200,000 AIWA mini home audio systems distributed by AIWA America, Inc. The recalled audio systems have model number CX-NA303U on the back of the unit. The systems are about 10 by 12 by 13 inches and include a combination radio, tape, CD player, and speakers. They were sold in electronics, department, and discount stores nationwide from March 1998 through July 1998 for about $200 to $250. Problem: These audio systems could contain a faulty transistor that can cause the unit to smoke, presenting a fire hazard. AIWA has 100 reports of smoking or emitting a burning odor and three reports of units catching fire. No injuries were reported. What to do: Stop using these mini-home audio systems and call AIWA America at 1-888-619-9353 between 6 a.m. and midnight ET seven days a week for instructions on returning the units for free repair. Product: About 58,000 wooden bunk beds made by Lexington Furniture Industries. The bunks are twin size and sold under the brand names, Lexington, Devan, YoungHinkle, Dixie, and Henry Link. The brand name is stenciled on the inside frame of the bed. These beds were sold in furniture stores and department stores nationwide from January 1980 through August 1997 for about $200 to $1,200. Problem: If the top bunk is mis-assembled, there could be a space between the end of the mattress and the end of the bed that could be large enough for a child's body to fall through, but small enough to entrap a child's head. Lexington Furniture has one report of a child falling through the space when the bunks were set up as twin beds; no injury was reported. What to do: Slide the mattress to either end of the top bunk and measure the space between the end of the mattress and end of the bed. It should not be 3-1/2"" or greater. If there is a space of 3-1/2"" or more, stop using the bed and call Lexington at 1-888-463-0111 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday for a free kit to close the gap.

What to do: Stop using the bassinet and call Century at 1800-583-4092 anytime for a free repair kit.   Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  NHTSA Recalls The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is the government agency responsible for improving safety on the nation's highways. As part of its efforts to achieve this goal, NHTSA is authorized to order manufacturers to recall and repair vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment (including air bags, tires, and child safety seats). The following safety recall campaigns are being conducted in cooperation with NHTSA. For more information about NHTSA recall activities, you can access NHTSA on the Internet at http://www.nhtsa. dot.gov or by calling the NHTSA Auto Safety Hotline at 1-888-DASH2-DOT (1-888-327-4236). American Honda Motor Company Honda is recalling 967,771 1995-1997 Accord sedans, coupes, and wagons (except the DX model and models with V6 engines) manufactured from April 1994 through May 1997. The factory installed air-conditioner wire harness was improperly routed allowing some wires to rub against each other, eventually causing a short circuit. The short circuit can possibly cause the underhood wiring to overheat and smoke, causing a fire in the engine compartment. A short circuit can also result in a blown fuse or dead battery. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Honda at 1800-999-1009. [NHTSA Recall 98V231] AmTran Corporation AmTran is recalling 2,293 1997-1999 Conventional school buses built with Code G47AODM outward opening service door and Code G47ACDC or G47A5DC manual door control and manufactured from February 1997 through August 1998. Certain clothing articles such as draw strings can become lodged between the door control rod clevis attachment as a person is exiting the bus. If the driver is unaware of this situation, the entrance door may be closed, capturing the item in the door, causing death or injury to the person exiting the bus. Owners who do not receive the free repair kit within a reasonable time should contact AmTran at 1-800-843-5615. [NHTSA Recall 98V200/AmTran Recall 98-303] BMW BMW is recalling 340,000 1992-1995 318i, 318iA, 318is, 318iSA, 318C, 318iCA, 325i, 325iA, 325is, 325isA,325ic, 325iCA, M3; 1989-1995 525i, 525iA, 525iTA, 535i, 535iA, 530i, 530iA, 530iTA, 540i, 540iA,M5; 1988-1995 735i, 735iA, 735iLA, 740iA, 740iLA, 750iLA; and 1991-1995 840CiA, 850i, 850iA, 850Ci, 850CiA, 850CSi manufactured from January 1988 through November 1994. A malfunction or failure of a coolant system component, such as a thermostat, water pump, or fan belt, can result in significantly increased coolant temperature and system pressure. If the indications of a critical overheating condition is not noticed by the driver, it is possible a coolant system component could be damaged or fail. If a crack were to form or a seam were to separate in the heater core end piece, hot coolant could suddenly be expelled inside the car, increasing the risk of personal injury to a car's occupant. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact BMW at 1-800-831-1117. [NHTSA Recall 98V178]  Chrysler Corporation Chrysler is recalling 685,000 1995-1998 Cirrus, Dodge Stratus and 12,996 1998 Plymouth Breeze and Chrysler Sebring passenger vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions and manufactured from July 1994 through January 1998. If the cable connecting the console shifter mechanism to the ignition key is improperly adjusted and the operator applies pressure to the release button on the console shifter to shift out of Park with the key in the locked position, the connecting pin in the shifter can break. If this happens, the ""ignition-park"" interlock system will be nonfunctional, and the vehicle can roll away if the parking brake is not set. Dealers will test and inspect for proper operation of the system. Any vehicles that are not functional after the inspection will have the shift mechanism and cable replaced with a ""self-adjusting"" design. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Chrysler at 1-800-992-1997. [NHTSA Recall 98V183/Chrysler Recall 789] Chrysler Corporation Chrysler is also recalling 157,000 1996-1997 Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, and Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager mini vans equipped with integrated child seats and manufactured from January 1995 through July 1997. The shoulder harness restraint on the integrated child seat can become difficult to release when the safety belt latch plate becomes contaminated. This can cause difficulty in removing a child from the restraint. Dealers will clean the latch mechanism. An extender will be added to the emergency release anchor for the child seat safety belts so that the release clips are more visible and accessible to the operator in the event that the retractor mechanism cannot be unlocked. In addition, an instructional owner's manual supplement card will be provided. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Chrysler at 1-800-9921997. [NHTSA Recall 98V185/Chrysler Recall 791] Ford Motor Company Ford is recalling 175,000 1995-1998 Contour and Mercury Mystique vehicles manufactured from July 1994 through January 1998. The floor shift automatic transmission control can be damaged if subjected to certain interior cleaning products. The gear position indicator can deteriorate and not correctly indicate the actual gear position resulting in incorrect gear selection. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Ford at 1-800-3923673. [NHTSA Recall 98V233/Ford Recall 98S26] Volkswagen of America, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The  Commission  has received correspondence  from Carol Pollack-Nelson, Ph.D., requesting that the  Commission  issue  regulations that would establish a mandatory standard for hunting tree  stands to address the risk of falling, and ban waist belt restraints  used with the tree stands. The  Commission  is docketing this request as  a petition under the  Consumer   Product   Safety  Act. 15 U.S.C. Secs. 2056  and 2058. The petitioner states that incident reports and medical  literature show that serious injuries and death are associated with  hunting tree stands and waist belt restraints. She states that  ``regulation is needed to ensure that stands are designed with optimal  materials and instructions in order to reduce the likelihood of a  fall.'' She also states that, although waist belts are intended to  prevent injury, they have been involved in four fatalities where  hunters were asphyxiated by them.

Why it is important for everyone to wear a lifejacket while boating 5. Two factors that increase the possibility for hypothermia and frostbite 6. Two factors that increase the possibility for heat exhaustion 7. The causes, prevention, symptoms, and field treatments of hypothermia, heat exhaustion, and frostbite 8. How to create a hunting plan    Physical conditioning The creation of a hunting plan Knowledge of first aid 1. Anticipated weather 2. Altitude 3. Terrain Topography, or the changes in elevation, such as hills and valleys, is important for a hunter to consider when planning an exercise program. Walking up and down hills requires much more energy than walking on flat ground. Also, y ou w ill place added demands on your body if you carry a backpack. If you will be hunting at higher elevations you will need to remember that the air will have less oxygen. This, too, will reduce your strength and endurance.  Physical Conditioning Physical conditioning is the strengthening of your hear t, lungs, and muscles. Physical conditioning takes time to accomplish. Don't put it off until the last minute! You should develop an exercise program that takes into consideration your age, weight, and general health condition. You may want to consult with your doctor when designing your exercise program. Listed below are some general health concerns to consider: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Age Weight Heart condition Allergies Physical limitations Medications  S  TUDENT  P  ERFORMANCE  OBJECTIVES  OUTDOOR SAFETY KEY TERMS Physical conditioning Topography First Aid CPR Hypothermia Frostbite Heat Exhaustion PFD  Long before the hunting season arrives, a hunter should start preparing himself or herself mentally and physically. This will help to provide a safe and enjoyable hunting experience. Important things to consider include:  The type of hunting that you plan to do will also have an effect on your exercise program. You should consider the environmental conditions you will encounter when getting in shape for a hunting trip. Some of these include:  57   Creating a Hunting Plan Some hunters don't consider their hunt until they step into the field. These hunters are missing out on a very important part of the hunt, the hunt plan. There are many benefits in taking time to plan a hunting trip in advance. You will increase your chances of having an enjoyable and successful outing when you carefully plan each hunt. Planning in advance with your friends and hunting partners also builds excitement and increases everyone's knowledge. Most importantly, a hunting plan could save your life by helping you be prepared and by letting others know your location and time of return. A hunting plan should address many different things. For example, the area where you will be hunting and the type of weather you may encounter will determine what type of clothing you need to take with you. Remember that weather conditions may change quickly. A wise hunter will be prepared for these sudden changes. Obviously, a long and distant hunting trip will require much more planning than a one-day hunt close to home. For a single day's hunt, you may choose to take a snack with you.  For longer hunting trips, especially those that include setting up a campsite, you will need to plan much more carefully for food and shelter needs. This may not be a problem if you will be driving to your hunting area. If you will be backpacking, however, you will need to plan much more carefully. For these trips you will need to take into account the amount of weight you will be able to carry. Make a list of all the hunting equipment you will need so that you will not forget any important items. Carefully check all your equipment to be sure it is in good condition. Make sure that you are familiar with the use of all your equipment. Become familiar with the habits of the game you will be hunting, and be able to accurately identify the game. Study the hunting laws for the area where your hunt will occur. Know what licenses or permits are needed. You may also need to learn about the altitude and topography of the location where your hunt will take place. Write out a detailed schedule for your hunt and leave a copy with someone who will not be going with you. This becomes very important when emergencies develop or if you fail to call or return on time.  Things to Consider in a Hunting Plan:                Hunting licenses Proper clothing Expected weather conditions Food Water Shelter Necessary equipment Method of travel Educational preparation Hunting law familiarization Detailed schedule First-aid kit Survival kit Signaling devices Watch  Someone should know when you plan to return and your actual hunting location.  58   If you have done a good job of planning, it is likely that you will have a safe and enjoyable hunt. It then becomes important that you stick closely to your plan. There is much truth in the old saying, ""Plan your hunt and hunt your plan."" When you return home, you should review your plan to see what changes you should make for your next trip. This will help to make your next outing more enjoyable and successful than your last.  Hunters should also learn how to properly perform CPR. CPR (cardio-pulmonary r esuscitation) is a combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing. Severe injuries, such as a victim of a heart attack or a person whose injury causes breathing or heartbeat to stop, will need CPR. An injury can occur while hunting even when we are careful. It is important to know what to do, and what not to do, in such medical emergencies. Improper care could worsen the victim's condition. Anytime first aid or CPR is needed you should remember the three basic steps:  First Aid Everyone, especially hunters, should take a class in first aid. First aid is the immediate and temporary care of the victim of an accident or sudden illness until a professional medical person arrives. In order to give first aid, it is essential that you carry a first-aid kit. A good first-aid kit includes:  Latex gloves  Sterile gauze dressings  Roller bandages  Tape  Triangular bandages  Space blanket  Rescue barrier for CPR  Maintenance medications  First-aid book  CHECK  CALL&  CARE  CHECK the area to be sure it is safe to attend the victim. If it is safe, CHECK the victim to find out what happened and determine their condition. If possible, CALL for help. After help has been contacted, you should then CARE for the victim, using the knowledge you learned in a first-aid / CPR class. A first-aid kit that you have with you will help greatly in providing care for the victim. 59  Review your hunting plan carefully and often. You should add information as you have new ideas and eliminate things that are unnecessary or excessive. As the time for your hunt approaches, you will need to finalize your hunt plan.   Understand that mild bleeding and fractures are not usually life threatening. However, a person who is not breathing or has no pulse is at great risk of dying. A victim who is unconscious should also be considered at risk of dying.  Extreme Conditions Extreme weather conditions can also create dangerous health situations for hunters. Proper precautions can greatly reduce a hunter 's risk of injury or even death. Hypothermia is a condition where your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat. This may be the greatest threat to a hunter 's safety. If your body temperature drops too much in your vital organs, especially your brain and heart, they will stop functioning. Hunters may be at risk of hypothermia due to exposure to cold air or cold water. Wet clothing, wind, exhaustion, and cold water greatly increase the danger of developing hypothermia. It is important to remember that hypothermia can occur at any time of the year. Hypothermia has been called ""The killer of the unprepared."" Hypothermia is a common condition and the number one killer of outdoor recreationists. It is important to plan ahead before going into the field. 60  While hypothermia is a reduction of your overall body temperature, frostbite is the freezing of body tissue (skin). Frostbite most commonly affects your fingers, toes, ears, nose, and face. It is usually caused by direct exposure to cold or to high wind. Frostbite may lead to the loss of skin and tissue, and may cause blisters. The resulting damage may be permanent. To avoid frostbite, keep skin surfaces covered in cold weather and take the same precautions as given for hypothermia. Heat exhaustion is a condition when your body becomes overheated. Increased air temperature, poorly ventilated clothing, loss of body fluids, low physical fitness, or being overweight can cause heat exhaustion. If severe, death may occur from damage to vital organs. You can help prevent heat exhaustion by avoiding too much activity on hot days. Also, be sure to wear loose clothing and wear a hat when in the sun. Drink plenty of water even when you are not thirsty.  HYPOTHERMIA Prepare 1.

This is especially true when hunting in an unfamiliar location. In a populated area, this will not usually be a serious problem. However, becoming lost could become a survival situation in a wilderness region that is far removed from towns and homes. You should always plan ahead to be prepared when going hunting. The greater the chance of becoming lost, the more detailed your preparation should be. Preparation should start with a personal survival kit that should be carried every time you go hunting. A belt pouch or fanny pack can hold items needed in a survival situation. A good survival kit should include the following:                62 Pocket knife Compass Plastic whistle Matches in a waterproof container Second fire making method Fire starter Soap Water purification tablets Medication (If needed) First-aid kit Drinking container Nylon cord Extra glasses (if needed) Sunglasses Signal mirror  If you do become lost or injured while hunting, remember to  STOP. S = Sit T = Think O = Observe P = Plan First, SIT and rest for a while. Being rested will help you to THINK more clearly. OBSERVE your surroundings and PLAN your course of action. By following these steps, you will be more calm and prepared to evaluate your situation more realistically. Panic is the worst thing you can do when lost. By admitting that you are lost, you will know to follow the steps outlined below. You are less likely to make mistakes that will make your situation worse if you follow these steps. 1. Wait for help as long as possible. Wandering through the woods to try to find your way back to camp will most likely result in being further off course. Since a hunter should always tell his hunting partners where he will be going, they will be better able to find you if you stay where you are. 2. Before it gets dark, make preparations for an overnight camp. Start a campfire and build  M S      ETHOD OF  IGNALING FOR  H  ELP  3 blasts on a whistle 3 fires in a triangle Signaling mirror SOS in snow or sand  BELIEVE IT OR NOT. You CAN get lost in Ohio or become injured! Survival knowledge should be important to every hunter.   a shelter. Take a inventory of your supplies and plan on how you will make the best use of each item. Plan on making your supplies last for three days. 3. Remember that the international signal for help is three of anything. 4. Three loud blasts on a whistle will alert those within hearing distance of your need for help. The proper response when hearing this signal is two return whistle blasts. Anyone going into the field should always carry a whistle for such emergencies. 5. If for any reason you do not have a whistle, you may fire three shots from your gun. Use extreme care to be sure your shots will be in a safe direction. 6. At night, three fires located in a triangle will give notice of your emergency. In daylight, a small mirror may be used to reflect the sun's rays and attract attention. You may also spell out ""SOS"" in snow or sand. When you are hunting alone, or if all of your hunting party becomes lost, remember that you left a hunt plan with someone. When you don't return or call on time, they will start looking for you. This is why it is very important for you to closely follow your hunt plan. That way your  rescuers will know where to search for you.  Water Safety A to an sible also a boat can help a hunter get area that would be imposto get to by foot. A boat is n easy way to carry your gear.  Before getting into your boat, you should check the local laws for any required equipment that must be carried aboard your boat. One such item that the law requires is a PFD, or a personal flotation device sometimes called a life vest. Everyone in the boat must wear a PFD. If you should ever fall overboard, a PFD will keep you afloat until you reach safety. You should never stand up in a boat. Any quick motion or wave could cause you to fall out of the boat. Always remember to load equipment and passengers evenly in the boat and do not overload the boat. This could cause the boat to turn over or sink.  When hunting near water or from a boat this device can SAVE YOUR LIFE!

Both victims were one of two people aboard each vessel.  Victim #1 was the vessel Captain and owner and victim #2 was the father of the vessel owner.  The United States Coast Guard responded to the incidents after emergency assistance calls were placed.  The United States Coast Guard determined that both victims' injuries were consistent with entanglement scenarios.  The Massachusetts FACE program concluded that to prevent similar occurrences in the future fishermen should:      disengage the transmission before attempting to work on or near a propulsion shaft and coupling   guard moving machine parts, such as propulsion shafts, to avoid contact           INTRODUCTION (Victim #1)    On December 30, 1999, the Massachusetts FACE program was notified by a newspaper clipping service, that on December 20, 1999, a 43-year-old self-employed male fisherman (victim #1) had been fatally injured.  His shirt became entangled in the rotating propulsion shaft of the fishing vessel he was aboard while attending to the bilge pump.  A site visit was not conducted as part of the investigation due to the unavailability of the vessel.  In addition, the incident, which occurred off the coast of Massachusetts, fell under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard Office in a neighboring state.  The Massachusetts FACE program Director held telephone conversations with coast guard personnel and collected the Coast Guard Investigation Report, Coast Guard Fishing Vessel Safety Alert, death certificate, and newspaper articles.    The victim, a self-employed fisherman, had owned and operated the vessel on which the fatality occurred for approximately one year.  A typical fishing trip for the victim would include one other crewmember.  Prior to buying his own fishing vessel, he had fished with a family member on his vessel.         INVESTIGATION (Victim #1)    On the morning of December 20, 1999, the Captain (victim #1) and his one crewmember set out for a fishing trip in a 54-foot long wood hull rig trawler off the coast of Massachusetts.  The boat had a 300-horse power inboard diesel engine.  It was reported that there were 2 to 3 foot seas and 10 - 15 knot winds out of the southeast with good visibility.    On the return trip back to shore, both men were in the wheelhouse and the fishing vessel was moving at 6 - 7 knots at 1,400 engine revolution per minute (rpm).  According to the Coast Guard Investigation Report, the victim left the wheelhouse to tend to the bilge pump because of water in the engine room bilge.  The other crewmember stayed in the wheelhouse.  The vessel's bilge pump was located beneath the propulsion shaft.  The propulsion shaft was connected to the transmission by a flanged coupling, and both the propulsion shaft and flanged coupling rotated when the transmission was engaged.  The flanged coupling consisted of two round metal sections bolted together with two retaining bolts that fasten the coupling to the propulsion shaft.  The shaft extended to the vessel's propeller.    To gain access to the bilge pump, the victim removed a wood deck cover, which exposed approximately 2 feet of the 2½-inch diameter shaft and the flanged coupling.  While reaching underneath the propulsion shaft to clear away debris from the bilge pump, the victim's shirt became entangled in the rotating shaft, pulling him into the bilge.  When the victim did not return to the wheelhouse, the crewmember went to the engine room and found the victim lying face down partially in the bilge with one arm over the propulsion shaft.    The crewmember returned to the wheelhouse and radioed for emergency assistance.  A nearby fishing vessel relayed the call to the Coast Guard and then went to the victim's vessel to try and provide assistance.  The Coast Guard arrived at the fishing vessel and freed the victim from the propulsion shaft.  The Coast Guard brought the victim and the fishing vessel in to a local wharf where they were met by the local police, state police, and a medical examiner who pronounced the victim dead.         INTRODUCTION (Victim #2)    On December 23, 1999, the local media notified the Massachusetts FACE program that on December 22, 1999, a 40-year-old self-employed male fisherman (victim #2) had been fatally injured.  He was on his son's fishing vessel (who was a self-employed fisherman), and while checking the vessel's transmission, his shirt became entangled in the rotating propulsion shaft.  On February 23, 2000 the Massachusetts FACE program Director traveled to the location where the fishing vessel was docked and interviewed the marina owner.  The death certificate, photographs of the fishing vessel, Coast Guard Investigation Report, and the Coast Guard Fishing Vessel Safety Alert were all obtained during the investigation.         INVESTIGATION (Victim #2)    On the morning of December 22, 1999, a fisherman (victim #2) and his son, who owned the fishing vessel, set out for a fishing trip off the coast of Massachusetts in a 30-foot long wood hull vessel, which was rigged for sea urchin dredging.  The vessel was equipped with a single inboard gasoline engine and a 70-inch long by 90-inch wide wheelhouse.  It was reported that there were 2 to 4 foot seas and 15 - 20 knot winds out of the northwest with 3 miles of visibility.  The son typically would work alone on his vessel.    The victim was on board to fish and assist his son in solving a problem with the vessel's propulsion system, particularly a vibration within the propulsion shaft area.  The victim had engaged the clutch from the operating station located inside the wheelhouse and directed the vessel on a southwesterly course.  While the victim went to check the transmission, his son took the wheel and steered the vessel.  The transmission was located below the deck, behind the operating station, and directly in back of the engine.  The engine protruded above the deck line and a wooden housing was used to cover the protruding section of engine.  The wooden housing measured approximately 33 inches long, 38 inches wide, and 30 inches high.  In addition, to the housing, there was a rectangular wooden deck cover located directly behind the wooden housing. When in place, the wooden deck cover eliminated access to the propulsion shaft and coupling.  The deck cover measured 33 inches long and 26 inches wide.    Prior to checking the transmission, the victim had removed the rectangular wooden deck cover exposing approximately 1½ feet of the 1½ inch diameter transmission propulsion shaft and coupling.  It was stated in the Coast Guard Report that the son heard a loud clanging sound and then the engine immediately shut down.  The son turned around and found his father entangled in the propulsion shaft.    It appeared that while the victim was checking the propulsion shaft and transmission, one or more of the rotating coupling retaining bolts had caught his shirt pulling him into the opening and entangling him with the shaft.  The son immediately radioed for emergency assistance.  A nearby fishing vessel's Master relayed the call to the Coast Guard and then went to try and assist the victim.  The Master of the nearby fishing vessel helped the son cut the father's clothing and freed him from the shaft, then they performed 2-person cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  A Coast Guard utility boat arrived and transported the victim to a waiting ambulance.  He was then transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.          CAUSE OF DEATH    Both medical examiners listed the causes of deaths for both victims as multiple traumatic injuries.         RECOMMENDATIONS/DISCUSSION    Recommendation #1: Fishermen should disengage the transmission before attempting to work on or near a propulsion shaft and coupling.    Discussion:  A rotating shaft creates a potential entanglement hazard for workers employed nearby; this hazard is increased when there are objects protruding from the shaft.  In both of these cases, the propulsion shafts were attached to the transmissions by flanged couplings.  Retaining bolts were used to fasten the couplings to the shafts and the bolts protruded from the couplings approximately ½ inch.  When the transmissions were engaged, the propulsion shafts and couplings were able to rotate at high speeds.  If the transmissions had been disengaged, the propulsion shafts and couplings would not have been rotating and the entanglement hazard would have been reduced.    In addition, lockout/tagout procedure should be considered for work on or near vessel propulsion shafts.  This may be most appropriate for larger vessels where a section of exposed propulsion shaft might not be near the wheelhouse.  The person performing the work could place tags at the control for the transmission and/or the ignition location prior to beginning the work.  This same worker would remove the tags only when the task was completed.  1           Recommendation #2:  Fisherman should guard moving machine parts, such as propulsion shafts and couplings, to avoid contact.    Discussion:  A guard should be designed and constructed to prevent a fisherman from having any part of their body exposed to potential injury even while other barriers such as floor covers are removed.  As stated in the United State Coast Guard Regulation 46 CFR 28.215 ""suitable hand covers, guards, or railing must be installed in way of machinery which can cause injury to personnel, such as gearing, chain or belt drives, and rotating shafting.  This is not meant to restrict necessary access to fishing equipment such as winches, drums, or gurdies.""  2     Certain maintenance activities and diagnosing of mechanical problems may require equipment to be operating, but prior to these activities, the machinery should be completely shut down and a visual inspection performed for possible hazards.  In these cases, once the floor covers where removed, the victims had unobstructed access to the rotating propulsion shafts and couplings. Guards could have been constructed out of metal, wood or plastic and have covered just the flanged coupling and the protruding retaining bolts minimizing the entanglement hazard.  In addition, when both guarded and unguarded machinery is operating, a safe distance should always be kept between the worker and the moving equipment.         REFERENCES      Code of Federal Regulations, Labor, 29 Part 1910.147 The Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout).

For the purpose of this statistical report, a hunting accident is considered to be an injury to an individual arising from hunting, firearm or archery related activity classified either ""A"", ""B"" or ""C"" as follows: A. B. C. An accident/incident resulting from the discharge of a firearm or bow while hunting, which causes the injury or death of any person(s). An accident/incident while hunting, not involving the discharge of a firearm or bow, which causes the injury or death of any person(s). Any other accident/incident resulting from the discharge of a firearm or bow, which causes the injury or death of any person(s), other than while hunting.  The purpose of the Report of Hunting and Hunting Related Accidents is to provide statistical information on the similarities, causes, frequency, and location of hunting accidents. This information is analyzed to aid in determining the directions of measures to deter hunting and hunting related accidents. By publishing this information and including it in Hunter Education Programs, the Wildlife Resources Commission hopes to reduce the number of hunting and hunting related accidents and fatalities to make the sport safer for all. Public concern about hunting accidents has been responsible for laws being enacted to require hunters to wear a hunter orange outer garment or hat and to require mandatory hunter education for new hunters. Copies of these laws are included in this publication.  Charles R.

Dale Questar motorboat, 18 feet 6 inches long, Alaska State No. AK 9955K, fiberglass hull and deckhouse, built in 1987 Coast Guard Auxiliary Vessel PUPPET, O.N. 681658, 48 feet long, 36 gross tons, built in 1985, uninspected Accident Type: Location: Date: Time: Property Damage: Injuries: Accident Vessel Complement: Capsizing Immediately south of Shelter Island on Lynn Canal near Juneau, Alaska August 21, 1994 1433 (Local) Approximately $10,000 1 Death 1 Operator 1 Passenger  On August 21, 1994, a disabled 18-foot Questar motorboat with the vessel's owner and one passenger on board capsized while being towed by the Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel PUPPET immediately south of Shelter Island, Lynn Canal, near Juneau, Alaska. The Questar's owner, who was mildly disabled, was trapped inside the vessel's cabin and was drowned. The passenger was not injured. In examining the Coast Guard's safety management during the 1994 Golden North Salmon Derby and the incident involving the Questar, the Safety Board identified five significant safety issues: communications during the derby, policy on the use of Coast Guard Auxiliary resources in hazardous weather and sea conditions, policy on removal of passengers from towed vessels, risk assessment training of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in search and rescue operations, and policy on postaccident toxicological testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in marine accidents.   this page intentionally left blank   INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS  THE ACCIDENT uring the morning and early afternoon of August 21, 1994, two men, the owner/operator, 45, and his passenger, 26, aboard an 18-foot Questar motorboat (see figures 1 and 2), were participating in the Golden North Salmon Derby south of Shelter Island, Lynn Canal, near Juneau, Alaska (see figure 3). The derby is an annual 3-day fishing tournament held in the Juneau area to raise scholarship funds. The Coast Guard estimated that up to 1,000 vessels would participate in the derby. The weather was overcast with showers, the wind was out of the south at 25-30 knots, and the seas were 3-5 feet. Sea water temperature was about 55 F. The National Weather Service in Juneau had issued a small 1 craft advisory for the Eastern Gulf Coast of Alaska, including the Lynn Canal and area around Juneau. Shortly after noon, the operator of the Questar tied the motorboat to the fish packing vessel KAMILAR, anchored near the south end of Shelter Island, to discharge his catch of fish. While next to the KAMILAR, the Questar took on water over its side from boarding seas. About 1230, as the Questar was pulling away from the KAMILAR, the outboard engines stopped. The motorboat drifted southwesterly toward Admiralty Island for 30-45 minutes as the crew made numerous unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines. The Questar's operator did not have a radio and flagged down a nearby recreational boat, the IDLE HOURS, to ask for help. The Questar's operator asked the IDLE HOURS' operator to call the Coast Guard for assistance. The IDLE HOURS was unable to reach the Coast Guard by VHF/FM radio because of the volume of traffic on channel 16, the VHF  calling and distress frequency monitored by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel PUPPET, a 48-foot Nordic fiberglass motorboat, was standing by in the Saginaw Channel on the west side of Shelter Island. The PUPPET was under the tactical control of Coast Guard Station Juneau in support of the 1994 Golden North Salmon Derby. The PUPPET was under the command of a Coast Guard Auxiliary operator, whose wife, an Auxiliary Boat Crew Member, comprised the crew. Both individuals, who were the vessel's owners, had 17 years of experience in the Coast Guard Auxiliary and, together, almost 350 patrols and 30 towing assists. Also aboard the PUPPET that day were four guests: a Coast Guard Chief Radioman assigned to the Coast Guard 17th District Communication Center in Juneau, his wife, and their two children. The Chief Radioman overheard the IDLE HOURS' radio call to the 17th District Communication Center relaying the Questar's request for assistance. He helped the two parties shift their radio conversation to a Coast Guard working frequency, channel 22, normally used by the 17th District Communication Center. The PUPPET's operator was fishing off the stern of his vessel at the time and was unaware of these radio conversations. The operator of the IDLE HOURS indicated to the Coast Guard that his vessel did not have sufficient power to tow the Questar to Auke Bay, a small harbor about 5 nautical miles southeast of the south end of Shelter Island. The Coast Guard Chief Radioman aboard the PUPPET radioed the 17th District Communication Center and stated that he was familiar with the Questar and that the PUPPET would be on-scene within the hour to assist. The Chief Radioman informed the PUPPET's operator that he had just committed the  D  A small craft advisory is a notice that alerts mariners to sustained weather or sea conditions that might be hazardous to small vessels.  1     4 PUPPET to a case, and the vessel got under way shortly thereafter. As the PUPPET motored toward the south end of Shelter Island, the operator directed that the towline and bridle be laid out on the afterdeck. He discussed the upcoming tow with the Coast Guard Chief Radioman, who mentioned that he had seen the Questar before. The operator stated that he believed his guest, the Chief Radioman, was experienced in small boat search and rescue (SAR) and that he therefore did not question him about picking up the Questar. The Chief Radioman later told investigators that his career was in the communications field and that he had little practical seamanship experience in small boat SAR operations. In effect, the operator of the PUPPET allowed the Chief Radioman to assume the responsibilities assigned to the PUPPET's Auxiliary crewmember. Coast Guard policy prohibits guests' involvement in Auxiliary patrol activities. Meanwhile, the IDLE HOURS had towed the Questar back to the KAMILAR and secured the vessel alongside, initially tying it to the weather side of the KAMILAR. The Questar's low freeboard and open decks allowed seas to flood the vessel, requiring that the crew bail out the water and run the bilge pump. The Questar was eventually moved to the leeward side of the KAMILAR to await the arrival of the PUPPET. About 1425, the PUPPET arrived on scene and prepared to take the Questar in tow. The PUPPET's operator did not discuss alternatives to being towed, the Questar's condition, or the physical condition of the Questar's operator and passenger. The Auxiliary operator of the PUPPET was unaware that the Questar had flooded and was susceptible to flooding from rough seas and that the Questar's operator had 2 medical disabilities. After advising the vessel's occupants to don their personal flotation devices The Questar's operator had mild cerebral palsy, was under medication for epileptic seizures, and had a left clubfoot. 2  (PFDs), the PUPPET's operator and the Chief Radioman passed the towline to the passenger on the Questar's bow, directing him to tie the towline around the anchor windlass. They did not consider the stem padeye of the Questar's trailer hitch as an alternate attachment point for the towline. The operator of the PUPPET then directed the Chief Radioman to advise the Questar's two occupants to go to the stern of the vessel; they were to wave their hands to communicate with the crew of the PUPPET if a problem developed during the tow. The PUPPET's operator did not set a towing watch. The Chief Radioman recalled that as the tow was getting under way, he looked back on the Questar and determined that everything looked ""OK"" to him. He admitted that he had difficulty seeing what was happening on the Questar at the end of a 150-foot towline. He did notice that only one of the Questar's crewmembers was still at the vessel's stern. He stated that the second crewmember might have moved into the vessel's cabin, a box-like structure fitted with smoked glass windows. The cabin was fitted with an accordion-style fiberglass (folding) door that provided access to the bow area and a second door (sliding glass) that opened to the stern. The afterdoor was open when the vessel was taken in tow. At 1430, the PUPPET's operator reported to the 17th District Communication Center that he had taken the Questar in tow heading for Auke Bay and that he would relay an estimated time of arrival when he had determined what speed he was able to make. He did not provide a situation report to Station Juneau, his patrol commander. The PUPPET and tow initially steered a southeasterly course toward Auke Bay through an area marked by the confluence of Favorite and Saginaw Channels. Sea conditions in this area were confused, with chop and breaking waves. When the Questar was about 150 feet from the KAMILAR, the PUPPET's Auxiliary crewmember noticed that the Questar was down by the bow and alerted the operator to slow down. After a wave suddenly broke over the   5 Questar's bow, the vessel assumed a bow-down attitude, flooding the foredeck. The passenger, who was sitting at the stern of the Questar, stated that he shouted to the operator to get out of the cabin and reached out to grab his wrist. Before the operator could exit the cabin, a second wave broke over the bow, causing the bow to submerge. Water swept aft, collapsing the deckhouse front accordion door and flooding the cabin. The passenger later stated that he tried unsuccessfully to pull the operator out of the cabin and that the next thing he knew, he was floating in the channel. Shortly thereafter, he observed the Questar, now full of water, slowly roll to starboard and capsize. The passenger was rescued within minutes by one of the boats that had been discharging fish to the KAMILAR at the time of the accident. When the PUPPET's operator, who was steering from the flying bridge, realized what had happened to the Questar, he reversed engines, causing the towline to become fouled in one of the propellers. The maneuverability of the PUPPET was thereby restricted, and it was unable to participate in the rescue effort. The PUPPET, with one shaft, later proceeded to Auke Bay. The master of the KAMILAR stated he had observed the events that occurred between the time the Questar was taken in tow and the subsequent attempt to rescue the operator trapped in the vessel's cabin. The master noticed the PUPPET's operator turn the tow in the direction of Auke and increase speed. He further stated that when the PUPPET increased speed, he became concerned and tried to contact the vessel using VHF/FM radio (channel 16) to advise the operator that he needed to slow down. Before the master could get through, the Questar capsized. At 1434, the KAMILAR's master radioed the 17th District Communication Center to advise them what had happened and that assistance was needed. The 17th District Communication Center immediately issued a 3 PAN on channel 16 describing the incident and A voice communication practice indicating that the calling station has a very urgent message to transmit 3  requesting that any vessel in the area help with the rescue. Shortly after notifying the Coast Guard of the accident, the KAMILAR's master launched one of his small boats to try to right the Questar and extract its operator. When the master realized that efforts to right the vessel would not be successful, he weighed anchor and maneuvered the KAMILAR alongside the Questar so that he could use the KAMILAR's seine winch to lift the Questar's bow out of the water. He was able to raise the Questar far enough out of the water to allow crewmembers from the KAMILAR to remove the operator from the Questar's cabin. About 25 minutes after the initial capsizing of the Questar, the unconscious operator was carried to the deck of the KAMILAR, where one of the crewmen who was a certified emergency medical technician (EMT) immediately initiated CPR. According to the EMT, the Questar's operator was not breathing and had no pulse; his skin color was blue. Station Juneau's 25-foot patrol boat, responding to the PAN, arrived at this point, and a Coast Guard EMT joined the attempt to revive the operator. The Coast Guard EMT provided a medical kit from the patrol boat containing a positive-pressure oxygen delivery system used for CPR, but the system's oxygen tank was empty and the EMTs continued with manual CPR. At 1507, the unconscious operator was transferred to Station Juneau's 25-foot patrol boat and taken to Auke Bay, where he was transferred to a waiting ambulance and transported to Bartlett Memorial Hospital. CPR was administered continuously during the trip to the hospital. He was pronounced dead at 2141 that evening. An autopsy indicated drowning as the cause of death. No evidence indicated fatigue, alcohol, or drug involvement in this accident. Except for  concerning the safety of a ship or person.   6 the autopsy on the Questar's deceased operator, no toxicological testing was conducted. Guard Auxiliary vessel, the FAERING, also assigned to Station Juneau for patrol during the derby, was responding to a medical case in the Shelter Island area. The FAERING reported to the 17th District Communication Center that it was under way to Auke Bay with a patient. This report was the first one indicating that a second Auxiliary vessel was responding to an assist case, and the Coast Guard did not quickly resolve the confusion among SAR personnel over which victim was associated with which incident. In addition, more than 2 hours passed before SAR controllers realized that the Questar's passenger had not been accounted for after the Questar capsized. In fact, the passenger had already been transported to Auke Bay and questioned by Station Juneau personnel. Station Juneau did not inform Group Ketchikan or 17th District SAR personnel of this fact. During its review of communication records, the Safety Board found that SAR personnel accepted and passed on inaccurate information without question or verification. At one point, Group Ketchikan, the SAR mission coordinator, briefed 17th District SAR personnel that a helicopter from Coast Guard Air Station Sitka, Alaska, was on the way to the accident site, that the FAERING was transporting the Questar's passenger to rendezvous with an ambulance, and that Station Juneau's 25-foot patrol boat was en route to Auke Bay to pick up a dive team, none of which was accurate. No one individual in the SAR communication network verified and assessed the streams of information for quality or significance during the Questar's response. Coast Guard Group Ketchikan had issued a 1994 Golden North Salmon Derby operational order that assigned Coast Guard Station Juneau as patrol commander of all support units, including four Coast Guard Auxiliary vessels, in its area of tactical control. Station Juneau's primary means of communication with units under its control was VHF/FM radio. However, Station Juneau was unable to communicate with its units reliably because of poor VHF/FM radio reception attributable to the location of its  SAFETY ISSUES In examining the Coast Guard's safety management during the 1994 Golden North Salmon Derby and the incident involving the Questar, the Safety Board identified five areas of concern: communications during the derby, policy on the use of Coast Guard Auxiliary resources in hazardous weather and sea conditions, policy on removal of passengers from towed vessels, risk assessment training of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in SAR, and policy on postaccident toxicological testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in marine accidents. Coast Guard Communications The Safety Board found deficiencies in Coast Guard communications during the 1994 Golden North Salmon Derby that compromised the Coast Guard's ability to effectively discharge its SAR mission responsibilities in the Juneau area. The Coast Guard estimated that approximately 1,000 vessels participated in the derby, yet discipline over the use of VHF/FM radio channel 16 was minimal. Legitimate traffic, such as the IDLE HOURS' initial call for assistance to the Coast Guard, was suppressed by the sheer volume of radio operators using channel 16 and by operators with more powerful radios. The Coast Guard made no attempt to minimize inappropriate use of channel 16 on August 21, 1994. Planning for the use of one or more public working frequencies during special events such as the derby could have alleviated the congestion on channel 16, the Coast Guard's distress, safety, and calling frequency. During the 1994 derby, a period of highvolume VHF/FM traffic, the 17th District Communication Center became a choke point for the flow of radio communication information. When reports of the Questar's capsizing were being radioed, a second Coast   7 antenna and high mountains in the area that blocked radio signals. For all practical purposes, Station Juneau was unable to exercise command over resources responding to marine incidents in its area. Before the Questar capsized, Station Juneau was unaware that two of its Auxiliary vessels, the PUPPET and the FAERING, were proceeding with assist cases. Moreover, the PUPPET's operator did not confirm with Station Juneau, the patrol commander, his intention to tow the Questar, although both the 1994 Golden North Salmon Derby operational order and a directive issued by the derby's Juneau Auxiliary Flotilla Commander required that he do so. The operator of the FAERING, also attached to Station Juneau, failed on several occasions to obtain authorization from Station Juneau before providing assistance to boaters in distress. The Safety Board believes that had Station Juneau been provided with reliable radio communication capability, allowing it to talk with units in its patrol area, the Coast Guard's confusion in responding to the Questar's request for assistance and subsequent capsizing could have been minimized. Policy on Use of Auxiliary Resources in Hazardous Conditions The Safety Board found that the Coast Guard 17th District does not have a policy on use of the Auxiliary in assist cases involving hazardous weather and sea conditions. The Executive Petty Officer at Station Juneau stated that the station limits such assist operations to calm seas and daylight hours. The Coast Guard's Auxiliary Boat Crew Qualification Guide, COMDINST M16798.21, defines calm seas as waves of 1 foot or less. It defines heavy seas as waves of 4 feet or more. At the time of the accident, Group Ketchikan had a draft 4 document specifying that under no Appendix 8 to annex E from Group Ketchikan's standard operating procedure, which was in draft at the time of the Questar accident, reflected Group Ketchikan's policy for use of the Auxiliary. Since the accident, the 17th Coast Guard District has reorganized, and Group Ketchikan has been eliminated. 4  circumstances should Auxiliary vessels be used in severe or adverse conditions. Neither adverse nor severe were defined. The National Weather Service in Juneau was predicting winds up to 25 knots and seas as high as 5 feet, for the Juneau area on the day of the accident. Before the capsizing of the Questar, Station Juneau had reminded Group Ketchikan that the station's 25-foot boat was on patrol near Shelter Island and was available for use. Coast Guard boat crews are regularly trained and tested in towing under hazardous conditions. Auxiliary operators, on the other hand, meet a much less demanding training requirement to maintain qualification. Nonetheless, the Auxiliary vessel PUPPET was allowed to respond to the Questar's request for assistance without SAR personnel having made a proper assessment of the Auxiliary operator's capabilities and limitations, the risks involved, or other response options available, as 5 is required under Coast Guard SAR procedures. The PUPPET's operator stated that the decision whether or not to tow was entirely his to make. He was unaware that Station Juneau and Group Ketchikan had policies restricting his authority to accept assist cases. The Coast Guard, responding to downsizing pressure, plans to shift more of its small boat operational workload from regular Coast Guard units to Auxiliary resources. The Safety Board believes that this accident demonstrates a need to clearly define limits in the use of Auxiliary resources when weather and sea dictate the use of better trained and equipped regular Coast Guard units.  Coast Guard National Search and Rescue Manual, COMDTINST M16120.5A.  5   8 The Safety Board believes that the occupants of a disabled vessel should be removed, if removal can be done safely, before the vessel is towed and that the Coast Guard needs to revise its policies on removal of occupants during towing operations to reduce the risk associated with on-scene response personnel making decisions based on incomplete information. Risk Assessment Training of Auxiliary Personnel Involved in SAR Operations The Safety Board is concerned that the PUPPET's operator failed to properly assess the risk to the Questar's operator and passenger in attempting to tow the motorboat. The Safety Board has addressed the issue of risk assessment by Coast Guard SAR personnel in its investigations of the capsizing and sinking of the SEA KING, RITE OF PASSAGE, and BIG ABALONE (see appendix A). Although the Coast Guard is training its active duty SAR personnel in risk assessment, Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel are not receiving this training. The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should have applied the lessons learned from the above accidents to its response in the Questar incident. It is critical to the success of any SAR mission that on-scene response personnel determine the nature of the problem, do a risk assessment, and decide on a course of action that minimizes the risk to life and property. The Auxiliary operator of the PUPPET, in responding to the Questar's request for assistance, conducted operations that exposed the Questar's crew to unnecessary risk. The PUPPET's operator also allowed a guest aboard his vessel to become involved in Auxiliary patrol activities, contrary to Coast 7 Guard Auxiliary operational policy. While his guest, a Coast Guard Chief Radioman assigned to the 17th District Communication Center, was experienced in communications, he had no practical experience in SAR and towing operations. Even if the operator thought that the Coast Guard Auxiliary Operations Policy Manual, COMDTINST M16798.3C. 7  Policy on Removal of Passengers from Towed Vessels The Safety Board is concerned that existing Coast Guard policy on removal of passengers before towing allows on-scene response personnel too much discretion. Although its SAR towing doctrine gives primacy to the safety of passengers during a towing operation, the Coast Guard does not have a policy for mandatory removal of passengers from towed vessels, assuming conditions are safe to do so. 6 Rather, its policy is to remove all occupants from the disabled boat, if necessary. The Auxiliary operator of the PUPPET assumed he had been directed to tow the Questar to Auke Bay. He discussed the upcoming tow with his guest, the Chief Radioman, and, based on the information available to him, decided not to remove the operator and passenger. The PUPPET's operator believed the tow was routine and that the Questar's operator and passenger were in no danger if they remained on their vessel during the operation. He neither determined the physical condition of the Questar or its crew nor asked the Questar's crew whether they had any concerns about being towed. Safety considerations did not preclude removal of the Questar's crew. The Questar was moored in the lee of the KALIMAR, and transferring personnel from the Questar to the PUPPET would have been routine. In fact, little benefit was to be gained from leaving the Questar's crew on their vessel during the tow. The PUPPET lacked an effective means of communicating with the Questar. Additionally, the crew of the Questar, which was at the end of 150 feet of towline, would have been unable to rapidly alert the PUPPET's crew to an emergency on the Questar or to assist the PUPPET's operator in managing the tow by, for example, adjusting the length of the towline (the adjustable end of the PUPPET's towline was tied around the Questar's anchor windlass). Boat Crew Seamanship Manual, Commandant Instruction M16114.5A. 6   9 Chief Radioman was experienced in small boat SAR, the Safety Board believes that he should not have allowed a guest on his vessel to assume the responsibilities properly assigned to the PUPPET's Auxiliary boat crewmember. The PUPPET's operator did not ask about the physical condition of the Questar's operator and passenger, in particular, whether anyone had special health problems or medical disabilities. Had he done so, he probably would have determined that the Questar's operator had mild cerebral palsy, was under medication for epileptic seizures, and had a left clubfoot. In addition, the operator failed to ascertain the condition of the Questar, what the original problem was, and what other problems the crew were experiencing with the vessel while waiting for assistance. The Questar had initially taken on water after unloading fish next to the KAMILAR, and the operator had been unable to start either engine. After the Questar was towed back to the KAMILAR by the IDLE HOURS, the motorboat continued to take waves over the side, requiring the operator and passenger to run the bilge pump and bail out water. The Questar's open fore and aft decks had minimal drainage, and the vessel had a low freeboard in relation to the waves it was encountering. Moreover, the Questar's high wind profile in relation to her shallow draft made her susceptible to wind loading. Had the PUPPET's operator examined the Questar more closely and talked to her crew, he may have determined that the vessel's seaworthiness in the prevailing sea conditions was questionable. Proper trimming of a vessel to be towed is one of the Coast Guard's principal towing safety precautions taught to SAR personnel. The PUPPET's 150-foot 5/8-inch double-braided nylon towline, connected to the Questar's anchor windlass on the main deck, created a downward force that may have prevented the Questar's bow from riding over waves encountered during the tow. A shorter towline with less catenary may have reduced the downward force on the bow of the Questar during the tow. The PUPPET's operator did not consider using the Questar's trailer hitch stem padeye, which would have been a better connection point for the towline because of its lower position on the vessel. Exacerbating the Questar's trim condition was the operator's move into the cabin as the tow was getting under way. Although the PUPPET's operator asked the Questar's crew to remain at the stern of the vessel, he did not monitor the crew's activities once the PUPPET was under way. The Questar operator's relocation into the deckhouse created a forward moment that increased the bow-down trim of the vessel. The PUPPET's operator did not set a towing watch that could have detected this condition. Setting an alert, dedicated towing watch that will maintain a constant watch and frequently account for all occupants on the towed vessel is critical during any towing operation and is recommended under Coast 8 Guard towing doctrine. The Chief Radioman aboard the PUPPET noticed that one of the Questar's crew had moved away from the vessel's stern, but the significance of the move was not apparent to him. The PUPPET's operator had not instructed the Chief Radioman in any towing safety precautions before getting the tow under way. When the PUPPET began its tow of the Questar, the PUPPET's operator did not evaluate the motorboat's response to being towed in the prevailing seaway at low speeds. When he looked back at the Questar, after being prompted by his boat crewmember to slow down, the Questar was already being dragged under the first wave. By the time he was able to reverse his engines, the Questar was capsizing. If the PUPPET's operator had observed how the Questar was responding at slow towing speeds, he may have noticed that the Questar was not riding over the waves but into them. The Safety Board believes that had the operator of the PUPPET evaluated the risk more thoroughly than he did, he would not have Coast Guard Boat Crew Seamanship Manual, COMDINST M16114.5. 8   10 towed the Questar with its crew aboard. However, unlike their counterparts in the regular Coast Guard, neither he nor his crewmember had received Human Error Accident Reduction Training (HEART) or similar risk assessment training. The Safety Board believes that had the Auxiliary crew of the PUPPET been trained in SAR risk assessment, this accident may not have happened. The Safety Board also investigated the issue of crew survivability during this capsizing. Had the PUPPET's operator monitored the actions of the Questar's operator and passenger and restricted their movements to the stern of the vessel, the Questar's operator may not have been trapped in the cabin when the motorboat capsized. In its investigation of the capsizing and sinking of the U.S. fishing vessel SEA KING, the Safety Board determined that the people who had remained on board in the cabin during the tow could not safely exit when the vessel capsized. Using lessons learned from the SEA KING and Questar accidents, the Coast Guard Auxiliary needs to revise its towing policies to ensure that people who remain on board a towed vessel are situated so as to ensure their safe exit in the event of an emergency. Toxicological Testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary Personnel During its investigation, the Safety Board found that Coast Guard SAR personnel involved in the Questar's capsizing, including the PUPPET's Coast Guard Auxiliary crew, were not toxicologically tested. The Coast Guard designated this accident a class A mishap and invoked the provisions of its Safety and Environmental Health Manual, COMDTINST M5100.47, by convening a vessel mishap analysis board. The medical officer assigned to that board is responsible for ensuring that appropriate examinations and laboratory procedures, including complete physical examinations and toxicological tests, are conducted to establish which human factors were relevant to the accident. While toxicological testing after a class A mishap is routine for active duty personnel, the Coast Guard does not have a policy to require toxicological testing of Auxiliary personnel involved in vessel mishaps, even if they are operating under Coast Guard orders. The Coast Guard justifies this position on the grounds that Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel are volunteers 9 and the ""Good Samaritan Law"" should apply. The Secretary of Transportation has published a directive (DOT Order 3910.1C) prescribing the department's policy and procedures for implementing Executive Order 12564, Drug-Free Federal Workplace. The directive calls for testing each employee, if his or her work performance may have contributed to an accident, for the presence of drugs following an accident involving one or more deaths. This policy applies to the Coast Guard. The Safety Board believes that members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, while operating on Coast Guard orders, also have significant responsibilities affecting public safety and should meet the same standards as full-time Coast Guard personnel.  Telephone conversation with COMMANDANT (GHSE-4) on April 28, 1996.  9   PROBABLE CAUSE  The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the Questar's capsizing was the flooding of the vessel due to use of improper towing procedures by the Coast Guard Auxiliary operator of the PUPPET. Contributing to the capsizing was the  failure of the PUPPET's operator to properly assess risk before deciding to tow the vessel in hazardous sea conditions. Contributing to the loss of life was the failure of the PUPPET's operator to remove the Questar's operator and passenger before towing the vessel.   RECOMMENDATIONS  As a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the following recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard: Improve Station Juneau's radio reception capability commensurate with its tactical responsibilities in the mission area. (M-96-11) Develop written policies that set limits, based on clearly defined weather and sea conditions, on the use of Coast Guard Auxiliary resources. (M-96-12) Revise Coast Guard search and rescue policy to require or recommend removal of occupants from towed vessels before beginning the tow if it is safe to do so. (M-96-13) Provide risk assessment training to all Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in search and rescue missions. (M-96-14) Revise Coast Guard Auxiliary policies on units rendering assistance to vessels  to ensure that all people who remain on board a towed vessel are situated so as to ensure their safe exit in the event of an emergency. (M-96-15) Revise Coast Guard regulations to require mandatory postaccident toxicological testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in marine accidents while operating under Coast Guard orders. (M-96-16) Incorporate the lessons learned from this accident into a case study training exercise for Coast Guard search and rescue units, including Coast Guard Reserve and Auxiliary commands. (M-96-17) Publicize the circumstances of this accident to all Coast Guard units responsible for search and rescue. (M-96-18) Disseminate a copy of this report to all Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel involved in search and rescue missions. (M-96-19)  BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD JAMES E.

C. 20594 Safety Recommendation  Date: April 13, 1994 In Reply Refer To: M-94-7 through -9  Admiral J. William Kime Commandant U.S. Coast Guard Washington, DC. 20593-0001  The National Transportation Safety Board has investigated three rescue efforts conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard during August 1993. The vessels in distress were two pleasure craft and one tugboat. Four persons died, three civilians and one Coast Guardsman. As a result of investigating these accidents, the National Transportation Safety Board determined that some of the Coast Guard personnel involved in each search and rescue (SAR) operation did not properly assess the risks. The Safety Board makes the following findings and recommendations: The first accident involved a disabled 27-foot sailing vessel near Charleston, South Carolina. At 0058,1 on August 4, 1993, the operator of the vessel, the RITE OF PASSAGE, used VHF-FM channel 16 to call Coast Guard Group Charleston, South Carolina. He said that he was about a mile east of Breaches Inlet, near Isle of Palms, South Carolina, and that he needed help because his vessel was disabled by engine problems. The Coast Guard communications watchstander questioned the operator and learned that he was the only person on the vessel and that the vessel was not aground but anchored. Believing that the operator was in no immediate danger, the watchstander classified the case as a ""non-distress""2 one and issued a Marine Assistance Request Broadcast (MARB). 3 A local, privately owned commercial towing  1 2 3  Eastern daylight time, based on a 24-hour clock. A SAR case is classified as a non-distress one if it does not constitute a threat to life or property.  A message broadcast on VHF/FM channel 16 asking anyone who is interested to help a vessel. Such a message is broadcast only about a vessel in a ""non-distress"" situation. Responders are supposed to reply on VHF/FM channel 22A. 6299   16 Appendix A company responded and offered to help. The watchstander told the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE that the towing company was coming.4 At 0100, the Isle of Palms police department telephoned the Coast Guard to report spotting a sailing vessel in trouble. The watchstander immediately dispatched the CG 41428, a 41 -foot utility boat (UTB). Neither the police nor the watchstander realized that the distressed vessel was the RITE OF PASSAGE. About 0120, a representative of the towing company informed the watchstander that his company did not have sufficient personnel available to assist the RITE OF PASSAGE. At 0125, the watchstander told the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE that the towing company could not help him, but that the UTB was proceeding to assist a second vessel in distress and would come to his assistance as soon as it was available. The operator replied that the RITE OF PASSAGE was dragging its anchor, had drifted near the beach, and was encountering heavy surf. The towing company notified the watchstander that it was now able to provide assistance to the RITE OF PASSAGE. The watchstander granted permission for the company to respond. Within minutes, the company vessel was underway. In the meantime, the UTB continued toward what was assumed to be the second vessel in distress but was actually the RITE OF PASSAGE. As the UTB approached the vessel, the coxswain observed the vessel's operator moving around the deck. The UTB's crew passed a towline to the operator, who secured it to his vessel. The operator then attempted to release his anchor line, apparently in an attempt to facilitate the towing operation. The coxswain, using a loudhailer, instructed him to go to the stern and put on a personal flotation device (PFD). Whether the operator heard the coxswain is unknown. Shortly thereafter, the UTB took the vessel in tow. The operator was last seen moving toward his vessel's stern, apparently in compliance with the coxswain's instructions. The operator was not wearing a PFD, and the vessel was pitching and rolling violently in the surf. Meanwhile, about 0240, the boat sent by the towing company arrived on scene. Its operator tried to establish radio contact with the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE. When his attempts failed, he maneuvered the company vessel alongside the RITE OF PASSAGE and placed a crewman aboard. Once on board, the crewman discovered that the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE was no longer aboard. The towing company personnel reported to the Coast Guard that no one was aboard the RITE OF PASSAGE. The coxswain of the UTB released the towline and began searching for the missing operator.  4  For more detailed information, read Marine Accident Brief No. DCA-93-MM-023 (attached).   Appendix A 17  At 0550, a local rescue squad recovered the body of the operator from the surf and transported himto anearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The official cause of death was drowning. The Safety Board believes that both the watchstander and the coxswain made mistakes in handling the case. The watchstander should have classified the incident as a distress case. The coxswain should, when he arrived on scene, have evaluated the situation more thoroughly and accurately than he did. According to Group Charleston policy , when prosecuting the SAR, the communications watchstander should have used a check-off list with criteria for deciding whether the call for assistance constituted a distress or a non-distress situation. The watchstander should have determined whether anyone on board the vessel had special problems or problems related to age or health and whether the vessel was at anchor or had a drift rate. The watchstander did not ask the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE all of the questions on the check-off list. Had he asked the questions, he likely would have determined that the operator was 67 years old, had a heart condition that required medication, and had had a heart attack within the last year. He would then have had a sufficient basis for classifying the case as a distress one and, consequently, for immediately dispatching a SAR vessel. When the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE told the watchstander that the vessel was dragging its anchor, was near the beach, and was encountering heavy surf, the watchstander had a second chance to decide the situation was a distress case. He should have immediately changed the status of the case and dispatched a SAR unit. Instead, he gave the towing company permission to handle the situation. Under Coast Guard policy, as stated in the National Search and Rescue Manua l (the SAR manual), the safety of people is always more important than the safety of property. Accordingly, the Coast Guard specifically requires its personne15 to assess a situation before making any attempt to take a distressed vessel in tow. By that assessment, personnel should establish and maintain communications with the people on the distressed vessel, ensure that they are wearing PFDs, and evaluate the risks that towing the vessel might pose to either Coast Guard personnel or civilians. Nevertheless, as soon as the UTB arrived on scene, the coxswain tried to take the RITE OF PASSAGE in tow despite the fact that the vessel's anchor was deployed, the operator was not wearing a PFD, and the operator was moving about on a deck that was pitching and rolling wildly. The coxswain did not pause to determine whether the operator or the vessel was in such immediate danger that he should be removed before any attempt was made to tow the vessel.  5  A11 personnel involved in a SAR case.   1 8 Appendix A The second accident involved the sinking of a 25-foot pleasure craft in Coos Bay, Oregon. About 1500,6 on Friday, August 20, 1993, the pleasure craft BIG ABALONE, with five persons on board, departed the Charleston Marina, Coos Bay, Oregon, for a day of recreational crabbing in the bay. Three of the people on board were older than 65. After a couple of hours of crabbing, the BIG ABALONE began having engine trouble and became disabled and adrift.7 Meanwhile, the charter fishing vessel BETTY KAY was returning to Charleston Harbor. The operator saw someone from the BIG ABALONE waving for attention. When he brought the BETTY KAY alongside the BIG ABALONE, he was told by the boat's operator of the engine problem and was asked to call the Coast Guard. The operator called Coast Guard Station Coos Bay via VHF-FM channel 16 (at 1719), reporting that the BIG ABALONE was disabled in Coos Bay with five persons on board. At 1721, a four-man crew, consisting of a coxswain, an engineer, and two crewmembers, got underway aboard the CG 44373, a 44-foot motor life boat (MLB). Shortly thereafter, the operator of the BETTY KAY advised the Coast Guard that the BIG ABALONE was slowly taking on water. The coxswain of the MLB decided en route that the pleasure craft needed to be dewatered and towed. He told the engineer to prepare to board the pleasure craft with a P-5 pump. The coxswain later stated that because the pleasure craft had not been reported as being in imminent danger of sinking, he had assumed that the flooding was probably minor. Consequently, he had decided before he arrived at the accident scene that there was no need to expose the pleasure boat's passengers to the dangers involved in transferring them to the MLB. The MLB arrived on scene at 1730. Winds were from the south at 10 knots, seas were 3 to 5 feet and choppy, and visibility on the bay was about 100 to 150 yards. The temperature of the water was 57 F. At 1732, the engineer boarded the BIG ABALONE and reported that there were about 6 inches of water in the engine casing bilge. He could not determine the source of the leak. The coxswain noticed the sea conditions were deteriorating rapidly and began maneuvering the MLB so that a towline could be attached to the BIG ABALONE. As the MLB approached the starboard bow of the vessel, an 8- to 10-foot swell broke over the starboard quarter of the BIG ABALONE. Almost immediately, another 8- to 10-foot swell broke over the stern, swamping the pleasure craft. Two of the passengers were trapped on the sunken vessel and could not be rescued. The other three persons on the boat and the MLB engineer were able 6  Pacific daylight time, based on a 24-hour clock.

They were transferred to a 20-foot rigid-hull inflatable boat from Station Coos Bay and transported ashore. While it is a sound practice for rescuers to make plans before they arrive on scene, the Safety Board believes that the coxswain should have reevaluated the situation when he arrived. The actual sea conditions were much more severe at the bar than indicated in earlier weather reports. In addition, the BIG ABALONE had drifted, and continued to drift, dangerously close to the bar. Had the coxswain reevaluated the situation, he might have realized that it was much more serious than he had thought and that transferring the engineer would do nothing more than increase the number of people who were about to be endangered by the sinking of the BIG ABALONE and, ultimately, the number of people who would have to be rescued. If after his reevaluation, he still believed that it was too dangerous to remove the passengers from the BIG ABALONE, he could have attempted to tow the vessel into quieter waters. The engineer could have then boarded the BIG ABALONE while the UTB continued towing the vessel back to Coos Bay. The third accident involved the sinking of a harbor tug on Lake Erie, Ohio. The DUKE LUEDTKE was a typical Great Lakes Harbor tug: 68.7 feet long, 17 feet wide, and 11 feet deep. Three persons were on board, the captain and two deckhands. After getting underway at 19308 on September 20, 1993, en route to Ashtabula, Ohio, the captain had checked the engineroom every hour to ensure that everything was operating properly. At 2300 he noted that there was 3 feet of water in the engineroom, whereas he had observed no water there during his previous check at 2200. He could not determine the source of the flooding. The wind was coming out of the west at 6 knots, and the seas were 2 to 4 feet. The air temperature was 63 F, the water temperature was 70 F, and visibility was 4 miles. At 2337 the operator of the tug called Coast Guard Station Cleveland Harbor, Ohio, on VHF/FM channel 16. He said he needed help because the water in the engineroom was about 3 feet deep. He gave his position as approximately 13 miles north of Avon Point on Lake Erie. About 8 minutes later, about 2345, he told the watchstander that the level had increased to about 5 feet.9 At 2340, Coast Guard Station Cleveland Harbor dispatched a 41-foot UTB, CG 41487, with a coxswain, an engineer, and three crewmembers. Before the coxswain got underway, the watchstander briefed him, telling him the vessel's identity, type, location, and problem. The UTB arrived on scene at 0323, September 21, 1993, and secured the UTB to the forward port side of the tug. Two of the UTB crewmembers immediately boarded the tug and entered a compartment above the engineroom through a watertight door on the port side, slightly 8 9  Eastern daylight time, based on the 24-hour clock.

They intended to determine the source of the flooding, stop the flooding, if possible, with repairs, and use a portable pump to evacuate the water. About 90 seconds after the UTB arrived on scene, the tug suddenly rolled to port and sank, stern first. The two UTB crewmembers were still inside the area above the engineroom. One of them managed to make his way to the wheelhouse through an interior forward bulkhead door leading through the galley and up to the wheelhouse. He then escaped through a window and swam to the surface, where he was rescued by the UTB. The other crewmember was trapped inside the tug. Divers from a civilian salvage company recovered his body the next day. All three crewmembers of the DUKE LUEDTKE survived. The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard's response to this incident demonstrated a clear lack of risk assessment, particularly by the watchstander and the coxswain. When the watchstander received the call for assistance, he was supposed to fill in a Search and Rescue Incident Summary form. 10 He did not fill in the part of the form labeled ""Initial Severity. "" He said that he had not sensed any urgency in the voice of the tug captain and that he therefore had not considered the situation to be life threatening. The Safety Board believes that the watchstander should not have based his assessment solely on his perception of the stress in the captain's voice. Because the watchstander misjudged the severity of the situation, he briefed the coxswain inaccurately, telling him that the tug was underway and taking on water, not that it was in danger of sinking. The coxswain stated that he believed that the case would be routine and could be resolved by putting two of his crewmembers on board to assess the situation, stop the flooding, if possible, and pump out the flooded compartment with a portable pump. He said that when he arrived on scene, the tug was riding smoothly, rolling slowly, and not listing. Therefore, he did not think it was likely to sink. However, with over 5 feet of water in the engineroom, the tug's stability had reached a critical point: the tug would ride smoothly and roll slowly until it was about to capsize and sink. The Safety Board believes that a properly trained coxswain would have known that the slow rolling of the tug was an indication that it was very unstable and ready to capsize. A properly trained coxswain would also have known that a vessel does not necessarily list before it capsizes or sinks. According to the surviving Coast Guardsman, when he and the other crewmember boarded the tug, he noticed there was about a foot of water on the after main deck. He said that when they entered the engineroom, the other crewmember closed the door so that the water on deck would not enter the engineroom. The Safety Board believes that the two crewmembers did not understand the severity of the flooding that had taken place before and during the time they  A form used to record important data and information about the vessel in distress. The form is vital for ensuring that SAR cases are properly assessed and prosecuted.  10   Appendix A 2 1  were on the vessel. The tug had already sunk to a point where the water level was above the freeing ports11 aft, allowing water to accumulate on the main deck. The Officer-in-Charge of the Station stated that over 90 percent of all SAR cases handled by his unit involve assisting recreational boats 19 to 25 feet in length. (The DUKE LUEDTKE was about 69 feet long.) Therefore the Station does not train its personnel in on-scene evaluation of a commercial vessel's condition or on the differences between assisting commercial vessels and recreational boats. The Safety Board believes that the coxswain in this case, lacking such training, was not able to recognize the risks involved in placing his crewmembers aboard the DUKE LUEDTKE or in allowing people to enter a closed space. Nor did he recognize the need to seek advice about the dangers of a flooded engineroom or the need to consult with licensed crew before taking action. Had he done a proper risk assessment, he would have known that everyone should have been removed from the tug immediately and that no one should have been allowed to go inside the deckhouse. The Safety Board also addressed the issue of risk assessment in its investigation of the January 11, 1991, capsizing and sinking of the fishing vessel SEA KING. 12 As a result of that accident, the Board issued Safety Recommendation M-92-54 on November 17, 1992, asking that the Coast Guard: Incorporate into the training of search and rescue (SAR) personnel procedures to ensure the gathering and dissemination of pertinent information by all appropriate SAR personnel to facilitate a thorough assessment of the potential risks to persons involved in a SAR mission. In its June 21, 1993, response the Coast Guard said that it concurred with the intent of the recommendation and planned to revive its on-scene commander's course, which had been discontinued in 1988. The Board consequently classified the safety recommendation ""Open-Acceptable Response,12 pending implementation of the course. In a November 15, 1993, letter, the Safety Board asked the Coast Guard for an update on the status of this project and is awaiting the reply. The Safety Board is concerned that the Coast Guard's reviving the course will not satisfy the need for risk assessment training at the Group and Station levels. As illustrated in the Board's investigations of the three accidents described in this letter, the communications watchstander in two of the three cases and the boat coxswain in all three cases failed to adequately assess the risks to the lives of the people on the distressed vessels. 0penings in the side plating of a vessel.

S. fishing Vessel SEA KING near Astoria, Oregon, January 11, 1991 (NTSB/MAR-92/05). 12 11   22 Appendix A The SAR manual explains how SAR missions should be conducted. Chapter 4, ""Awareness and initial Action,"" states: . . the information collected and the initial action taken are critical to SAR success. Information must regathered and evaluated to determine the nature of the distress... and what action should be taken . . . . [section 400] The risks inherent in any SAR response must be carefully weighed against the mission's chances for success, that is, the saving of life or, to a lesser extent, property . . . . [section 446] The Safety Board believes that had the watchstanders and the coxswains involved in these accidents been more aware of the importance of following the guidance in the above sections of the SAR manual and had they done a better job of assessing the risks that the people on the distressed vessels were facing, they would have decided to remove them from the vessels as soon as possible. Because of its high freeboard, the MLB involved in the BIG ABALONE accident had great difficulty in retrieving one of the survivors. The Safety Board found the same problem in a previous accident, the December 2, 1989, sinking of the small passenger vessel BRONX QUEEN13 in Lower New York Bay, New York. As a result of that accident, the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation M-90- 111, asking that the Coast Guard: Develop new methods and or equipment for use aboard the 44-foot motor life boat to expedite the retrieval of survivors from the water during search and rescue operations. In its March 22, 1991, response, the Coast Guard agreed with the Safety Board on this matter and said that it would direct the National Motor Lifeboat School and the UTB System Center to investigate alternative methods of recovering people from the water. The Safety Board had asked that the Coast Guard not only investigate, but also develop alternative methods. Pending the Coast Guard's further reply to this recommendation, it was classified ""Open-Acceptable Response. "" On October 10, 1993, the Coast Guard stated that it had bought and tested four different inflatable ""rescue ramp"" prototypes and that after it made some minor modifications, the testing would continue. The Coast Guard said that once the design was acceptable, it would seek funds for outfitting selected Coast Guard units with the ramps. The Board continues to hold this safety recommendation in an ""Open--Acceptable Response"" status.  For more information, see page 57 of the Safety Board's Marine Accident Brief NTSB/MAB-92/01, a compilation of accident briefs.  13   Appendix A 23  In view of the BIG ABALONE accident, the Safety Board reiterates Safety Recommendation M-90-1 11 and asks that the Coast Guard expedite its testing of the rescue ramps and supply them to the Coast Guard's fleet of 44-foot MLBs as soon as practicable. If the Coast Guard determines that the ramps are unsuitable, the Safety Board strongly urges the Coast Guard to provide a suitable alternative. And lastly, as a consequence of the Board's investigation of the three accidents described in this letter, the Safety Board recommends that the Coast Guard: Provide risk assessment training to all Coast Guard personnel directly involved in search and rescue missions. (Class II, Priority Action) (M-94-7) Review search and rescue procedures to ensure that all search and rescue personnel are trained to recognize the differences between assisting commercial vessels and recreational boats. (Class II, Priority Action) (M-94-8) Publicize the circumstances of these accidents to all Coast Guard search and rescue units.

The operator stated that the vessel was disabled with engine problems about 1 mile east of Breaches Inlet near Isle of Palms, South Carolina, and that he needed assistance. He told the Coast Guard communications watchstander that he was the only person on the vessel, that the vessel was not aground but anchored, and that the vessel was a 27-foot white-hulled sloop. Believing that the operator was in no immediate danger, the watchstander classified the incident as a ""non-distress"" situation and issued a Marine Assistance Request Broadcast (MARB). 2 A local towing company responded  l  A1l times are Eastern daylight time based on a 24-hour clock.

The  Coast Guard then passed this information to the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE. Thecommunications watchstander, contrary to Group Charleston policy, did not ask the operator all of the questions on the search and rescue (SAR) check-off list. Had he asked the questions he would have learned that the operator was a 67-year-old man with a heart condition that required medication and that he had had a heart attack within the last year. Such information would have allowed the watchstander to classify the case as a distress one and consequently dispatch a SAR unit. At 0100, the Coast Guard received a telephone call from the Isle of Palms Police Department reporting that a sailing vessel (identity unknown) was aground and listing badly about 100 yards off the beach near the north end of Isle of Palms. About 0106, the Coast Guard dispatched the C 41428, a 41-foot utility boat (UTB), to respond to what was apparently a second vessel in distress. 3 About 0120, a representative of the towing company told the watchstander that his company did not have sufficient personnel available to assist the RITE OF PASSAGE. At 0125, the watchstander told the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE that the towing company was unable to assist him but that a UTB was proceeding to help a second vessel in distress and would come to his assistance as soon as it was available. It was at this time that the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE reported that his vessel was dragging its anchor, was located near the beach, and was encountering heavy surf. The wind on scene was about 25 knots, and the seas were between 3 and 4 feet in height. Shortly thereafter, the towing company notified the watchstander that it was now able to help the RITE OF PASSAGE. The watchstander granted permission for the company to respond. Within minutes, a privately-owned commercial vessel got underway to render assistance to the RITE OF PASSAGE. About 0155, the coxswain of the UTB reported that he had spotted a white-hulled sailing vessel in the surf off Isle of Palms and that he was maneuvering the UTB inshore, toward the vessel. He made several attempts to contact the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE vessel on VHF-FM channels 16 and 22A but was unsuccessful. As the UTB approached the stricken vessel, the coxswain observed the vessel's operator moving around the deck. The crew of the UTB passed a towline to the operator, who secured it to his vessel. He then attempted to release his anchor line, apparently in an attempt to facilitate the towing operation. The coxswain, using a loudhailer, instructed him to proceed to the stern of the RITE OF PASSAGE and to don a personal flotation device (PFD). It could not be determined whether the operator heard the instructions.  1n fact, the vessel that the Isle of Palms Police Department had sighted was the RITE OF PASSAGE, but this was not known at the time.  3   26 Appendix A Shortly thereafter, the UTB took the vessel in tow. The operator was last seen moving toward his vessel's stern, apparently in compliance with the coxswain's instructions. He was not wearing a PFD, and the RITE OF PASSAGE was pitching and rolling violently in the surf at this time. Meanwhile, the boat dispatched by the towing company arrived on scene. Its operator attempted to establish radio contact with the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE. About 0245, when these attempts proved unsuccessful, the operator of the towing company vessel maneuvered alongside the RITE OF PASSAGE and placed a crewman aboard. When the crewman got on board, he discovered that the vessel's operator was no longer aboard. The towing company personnel reported to the Coast Guard that no one was aboard the RITE OF PASSAGE. The coxswain of the UTB released the towline and began searching for the missing operator. At 0550, a local rescue squad recovered the operator's body from the surf and transported it to a nearby hospital, where the operator was pronounced dead. He was not wearing a PFD. The official cause of death was determined to be drowning. Probable Cause The National Transportation Safety Board was unable to determine the probable cause for the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE falling overboard. Contributing to the loss of life was the failure of the Coast Guard communications watchstander and coxswain to properly assess the risk to the operator of the RITE OF PASSAGE and the failure of the coxswain of the CG 41428 to remove the operator before attempting to tow the vessel.   Appendix A 27  NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD WASHINGTON, D.C. 20594 Marine Accident Brief No. DCA-93-MM-029 Adopted March 25, 1994  Vessel: Accident Type: Location: Date: Time: Owner: Property Damage: Injuries: Complement: Description of the Accident  BIG ABALONE, a25-Foot-Long Fiberglass Pleasure Craft, Registration No. 0R176KD Sinking Coos Bay, Oregon(Latitude 43''21.16'N, Longitude 124 21.36'W) August 20, 1993 Approximately 1734, Local Mr. Clair Irwin, Myrtle Creek, Oregon $10,000 2 Fatalities 5  About 1500,1 on Friday, August 20, 1993, the pleasure craft BIG ABALONE departed the Charleston Marina, Coos Bay, for a day's recreational crabbing in the bay. The vessel had five passengers: the 67-year-old owner/operator of the pleasure craft, his 68-year-old wife, another couple ages 66 and 58, and a 46-year-old woman. The owner had bought the boat in April 1993 and put it in the water in June. He had owned and operated other smaller boats but had never taken courses from any organization in either boat or marine-radio operation. This outing was the fourth or fifth time he had taken this boat away from the pier. The group baited and set crab traps within the protective jetty entrance at Coos Bay, between buoys G5 and G5A. After the traps were checked for catch, the BIG ABALONE began having engine trouble. Because of the engine trouble, the BIG ABALONE was disabled and adrift in Coos Bay. Meanwhile, the charter fishing vessel BETTY KAY, which was returning to Charleston Harbor, was proceeding inbound approaching buoy G5A. Its operator saw someone waving for attention from the drifting pleasure craft. When he brought the BETTY KAY alongside of the BIG ABALONE, he was told by that boat's operator of the engine problem. Even though the BIG ABALONE's operator stated that his CB and VHF radios were on and tuned to channel 11 and channel 16, he asked the operator of the BETTY KAY to call the Coast Guard and tell them  1  All times in this report are Pacific daylight time based on a 24-hour clock.   28 Appendix A of his problem. At 1719, the operator of the BETTY KAY contacted the communications center at USCG Station Coos Bay, via VHF-FM radio channel 16. He reported that the BIG ABALONE was disabled and adrift in Coos Bay, between buoys G5 and G5A, with five persons on board. The communications watchstander told the operator to instruct all persons on board the BIG ABALONE to don personal flotation devices (PFDs). The BETTY KAY's operator passed on the Coast Guard's instructions, and all persons on board the BIG ABALONE complied. The BETTY KAY remained within shouting distance of the BIG ABALONE while awaiting the arrival of the Coast Guard. According to the BETTY KAY's operator, after a short while, he noticed that the pleasure craft appeared a little low in the water. He asked the BIG ABALONE's operator whether his vessel was taking on water. The operator of the BIG ABALONE said it was not. The BETTY KAY operator asked a second time, and after checking his boat, the BIG ABALONE operator confirmed that his vessel was slowly taking on water. The BETTY KAY relayed this information to the Coast Guard. He also informed the Coast Guard that all persons on the disabled boat were now wearing PFDs. The Coast Guard instructed the BETTY KAY's operator to switch his VHF radio to channel 22A for all further communications with the Coast Guard. At 1719, when the BETTY KAY's initial call was received at Station Coos Bay, the watchstander sounded the alarm to activate the duty boat crew. At 1721, a four-man crew, consisting of a coxswain, who was in command, an engineer, and two crewmen, got underway aboard the CG 44373, a 44-foot motor life boat (MLB). Among the MLB's standard equipment were a VHF-FM radio, radar, Loran, towing lines, and a P-5 gas-engine-driven portable pump. According to the morning (0855) weather report, conditions at Coos Bay Bar were as follows: southerly winds at 10 knots, swells of 3 to 5 feet occasionally running to 6 feet, choppy, with a 2-knot ebbing current, The morning weather report also contained a rough bar warning because of ""extremely hazardous bar conditions, "" which restricted recreational boats less than 20 feet long from crossing the bar at the entrance to Coos Bay. The rough bar warning and restriction were issued by Station Coos Bay and broadcast on the radio regularly by the Coast Guard. The coxswain stated that, based on the morning weather report and rough bar warning, the position of the BIG ABALONE (inside the jetty), and radio-transmitted information concerning the pleasure craft (disabled, adrift, and taking on water), he decided while he was en route to de-water and tow the pleasure craft to shore. The coxswain further stated that he was aware the pleasure craft was taking on water, but it was his understanding that the boat was not in danger of sinking. To this end, the coxswain told the MLB engineer to prepare to board the pleasure craft with a P-5 de-watering pump. When the coxswain saw the pleasure craft, he released the BETTY KAY to return to port. As the coxswain brought the MLB close to the BIG ABALONE, he noticed two women in the forward portion of the pleasure craft, outside the small cabin, but protected by a canvas cover. They were sitting on a bench facing forward at the boat's control console. The two   Appendix A 29  women waved calmly to the crew as the MLB approached the BIG ABALONE. The two male occupants were standing in the stern of the pleasure craft, along with the 46-year-old female. According to the coxswain, the people in the pleasure craft showed no signs of panic or fear. The coxswain stated that because the pleasure craft did not appear to be in imminent danger of sinking, he believed that the reported flooding was probably minor. He later stated that the conditions on the bar were more severe than the early weather report had indicated. The ebb tide appeared to be about 4 to 5 knots with seas of about 7 to 8 feet. He therefore saw no need to expose the pleasure boat's passengers to possible injury by attempting to transfer them to the MLB in the rough sea. He observed that the BIG ABALONE was setting seaward toward the bar with the ebbing tidal current. And he believed that the transfer of his engineer and a P-5 pump to the pleasure craft would not endanger the vessel or the people on board. The coxswain maneuvered along the BIG ABALONE's port side, and about 1732, the engineer boarded the pleasure craft. The P-5 pump was then transferred to him. Once on board, the engineer reported to the coxswain about 6 inches of water in the engine casing bilge. He also reported that the water around the engine was calm and flat and that he could not determine the source of the leak. After transferring the engineer, the coxswain maneuvered the MLB aft along the port side of the pleasure craft, turned around the stern, and proceeded up along the starboard side to position the MLB ahead of the BIG ABALONE to facilitate towing. About 1734, as the MLB neared the starboard bow of the pleasure craft, an 8- to 10-foot swell broke over the stern of the BIG ABALONE. The coxswain yelled, ""Get all the people out on deck. "" But his warning was too late. By then another 8- to 10-foot swell had broken over the stern again, swamping the pleasure craft. Suddenly, the open stern of the vessel was under water, and the forward half of the pleasure craft pointed up out of the sea at about a 45-degree angle. The coxswain clearly saw the two women sitting on the front bench seat at the boat's control console as the pleasure craft slipped beneath the sea stern first. Only about 2 minutes had passed since the engineer had boarded the pleasure craft. The coxswain yelled to his remaining crew to get a count of all people in the water. Following the swamping of the BIG ABALONE, the coxswain radioed Station Coos Bay and reported that the pleasure craft had capsized and there were four people visible in the water, including his engineer. All of the BIG ABALONE's occupants still had on their PFDs. By this time, the bow of the pleasure craft was protruding only about 1.5 feet above the surface of the sea. An MLB crewmember requested permission to enter the water and assist in retrieving the people. The coxswain immediately granted permission, and the crewmember jumped into   30 Appendix A the 57 F sea water.2 The crewmember (rescue swimmer) assisted the survivor nearest the MLB, the 46-year-old woman, who weighed about 270 pounds, Another crewmember threw the rescue toss line to the rescue swimmer, and together they maneuvered the woman toward the side of the MLB. After numerous attempts, the two MLB crewmen on board the MLB, with the help of the two crewmembers who were in the water, succeeded in getting the woman on board the MLB. The coxswain threw a life ring to the engineer, who held onto the BIG ABALONE's operator. The boat operator was holding onto the P-5 pump, which was still afloat in its buoyant drum-like container. The engineer and the operator were pulled to the side of the MLB with the life ring retrieving line. The operator held on until the 46-year-old woman was removed from the water. Then the operator was lifted on board the MLB. The last survivor, a male, was observed clinging to the bow of the pleasure craft. The nearly submerged pleasure craft was drifting toward the MLB, and the survivor was between the two vessels and in danger of being injured between them. The MLB engineer swam to him and pulled him free of the pleasure craft bow. A crewmember reached over the side of the MLB, while the coxswain held onto his belt, and together all four crewmen pulled and pushed the survivor onto the MLB. Then the coxswain and a crewmember lifted their shipmate (rescue swimmer) into the MLB. The engineer pulled himself on board the MLB. According to the MLB crew, the three survivors appeared to be in various stages of shock. One of the elderly men was dazed and sobbing and very depressed. Another survivor appeared to have a bluish or purplish complexion and was complaining of chest pains, and the third survivor had bruised or broken ribs. At that time the MLB was rolling through an 80degree arc (40 degrees to each side) when a 20-foot rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) from Station Coos Bay came alongside. The coxswain decided to transfer the survivors to the RHIB, while the MLB continued the search for other possible survivors. The survivors were transported ashore to a waiting ambulance. They were taken to local hospitals, where they were treated and released. During the transfer of the survivors, the MLB crew lost sight of the bow of the BIG ABALONE. Following the transfer, the MLB coxswain returned to the accident site and began a search from that location, accounting for the ebb tide. About 25 minutes later, he was joined by the Station's 30-foot patrol boat. Shortly after that, a helicopter from USCG Air Station North Bend and the 52-foot MLB INTREPID joined in the search. An air and sea search for the two missing women continued for a day and a half with negative results. The bodies of the two victims were never found. Probable Cause  The estimated survival time in 57 F water is 1 to 6 hours. However, a person may become exhausted or unconscious within 1 to 2 hours as a result of hypothermia and may drown while afloat in a PFD. A person's age is also a factor in his/her ability to survive.  2   Appendix A 31  The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the sinking of the BIG ABALONE was the swamping of the drifting and disabled pleasure craft because of the heavy seas at Coos Bay Bar. Contributing to the loss of life was the failure of the coxswain of the CG 44373 to remove the passengers before attempting to tow the vessel into safer waters.   3 2 Appendix A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD WASHINGTON, D.C. 20594 Marine Accident Brief No. DCA-93-MM-030 Adopted March 25, 1994  Vessels:  Accident Type: Location: Date: Time: Owner: Property Damage: Injuries: Deaths: Complement:  U.S. Tug DUKE LUEDTKE, O.N. 216022, 68.7 Feet Long, 73 Gross Tons, Built in 1917, Uninspected Coast Guard Utility Boat, CG 41487, 41 Feet Long Sinking Lake Erie, about 13 Miles North of Avon Point, Cleveland, Ohio(Latitude 41 43.6'N, Longitude 81 58.6'W) September 21, 1993 Approximately O033, Local Luedtke Engineering Company, Frankfort, Michigan In Excess of $250,000.00 (Total Loss) 3 (Minor) 1 3 (Tug), 5 (Coast Guard Boat)  Description of the Accident At 19301 on September 20, 1993, the commercial tug DUKE LUEDTKE departed West Harbor, Ohio, en route to Ashtabula, Ohio. It was a typical Great Lakes harbor tug, steel hulled, and of both riveted and welded construction. The wind was coming out of the west at 6 knots, and the seas were 2 to 4 feet. The air temperature was 63 F, and the water temperature was 70 F. Visibility was 4 miles. Three persons were on board, the operator and two deckhands. After getting underway, the operator made routine hourly checks of the engineroom to ensure that everything was operating properly. At 2300 he noted 3 feet of water in the engineroom, whereas he had observed no water during his previous check at 2200. He looked for but could not determine the source of the flooding.  l  A1l times are Eastern daylight time and are based on the 24-hour clock.   Appendix A 33  At 2337, the DUKE LUEDTKE was about 13 miles north of Avon Point, Ohio, when the operator transmitted a distress call on VHF/FM channel 16, reporting his vessel was taking on water and required assistance. The distress call was immediately answered by the communications watchstander at Coast Guard Station Cleveland Harbor, Ohio. The tug operator told the watchstander that the water in the engineroom at that time was about 3 feet deep. Later, at 2355, he advised the watchstander that the level had increased to 5 feet. At 2340, Coast Guard Station Cleveland Harbor dispatched the 41-foot utility boat (UTB) CG 41487 with a crew of five (a coxswain, an engineer, and three crewmembers) to render assistance. Before getting underway, the coxswain reported to the watchstander for a briefing. The watchstander advised him of the vessel's identity, type, and location and that the vessel was taking on water. The coxswain did not talk to the tug operator while en route, nor did the coxswain talk to the operator when the UTB arrived on scene. The tug operator stated that as soon as the UTB was alongside, it was secured to the forward port side of the tug. Unknown to the operator, two Coast Guard crewmembers immediately boarded the tug and asked one of the tug's deckhands for directions to the engineroom. The crewmembers entered the compartment above the engineroom through a watertight door on the port side, slightly aft of amidships, closing the door behind them. About 90 seconds after the UTB came alongside, the tug heeled to port and sank stern first. Both of the crewmembers who had boarded the tug were trapped in the area above the engineroom when the tug sank. Earlier, the tug operator had instructed his two deckhands to don their survival suits and stay on the main deck. Both were on the port bow of the tug when the UTB came alongside. As the tug started to sink, one of the deckhands jumped from the tug to the bow of the UTB and was helped aboard. The other deckhand jumped into the water and was rescued shortly thereafter by the UTB. The tug operator escaped through a window of the wheelhouse into the water and was rescued by the CG 41391, a UTB from Coast Guard Station Lorain, Ohio, that had also responded to the incident. He was transferred to the Cleveland Harbor UTB and later taken to a Cleveland hospital, where he was admitted and treated for chest pains. One of the UTB crewmembers who had boarded the tug managed to escape from the engineroom area through a forward bulkhead door leading through the galley and up to the wheelhouse. He escaped by breaking out a window in the wheelhouse and swimming to the surface. He was rescued by the Cleveland Harbor UTB and transported to the Lorain County Hospital by a Coast Guard helicopter from Coast Guard Air Station, Detroit, Michigan. The other Coast Guardsman remained missing. Searches were conducted by various Coast Guard units, civilian helicopters, and civilian agency vessels throughout the night. Additional Coast Guard helicopters joined the search at daybreak and continued the search for him throughout the day with no success. On September 22, 1993, his body was recovered from the tug in the area above the engineroom by divers from a civilian salvage company. They were helped by divers   34 Appendix A from the Cleveland and Lorain police departments. The Cleveland Harbor Station's communications watchstander was responsible for executing a search and rescue (SAR) Incident Summary form2 when he received the tug's call for Coast Guard assistance. The form has a case data section that includes information to be obtained and entered under the heading ""Initial Severity."" The SAR Incident Summary form executed during this case had no entry under ""Initial Severity. "" The watchstander stated that there was no sense of urgency in the voice of the tug operator when he was talking on the radio; therefore, the watchstander did not consider the situation to be life threatening. Consequently, when the coxswain reported to the watchstander for a briefing of the accident, the coxswain was not made aware that the tug was in danger of sinking, only that it was underway and taking on water. The coxswain stated that he initially believed that he was on a routine case that could be resolved by putting two of his crewmembers on board to assess the situation, stop the flooding if possible, and pump out the flooded compartment with a portable pump. The coxswain stated that when the UTB arrived on scene, the tug did not appear to him to be in danger of sinking. When questioned about how he made this assessment, he stated that the vessel was riding smoothly and rolling slowly. He further stated that because the vessel was not listing, he did not think it was in danger of sinking. When the two crewmembers boarded the tug, the surviving crewmember stated, he noticed there was about a foot of water on the after main deck of the tug. He said that when they entered the engineroom, the other crewmember closed the door so that the water on deck would not enter the engineroom. The tug had already sunk to a level above the freeing ports3 aft, allowing water to accumulate on the main deck. Probable Cause The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the sinking of the tug boat DUKE LUEDTKE was the flooding of the vessel's engineroom from an unknown source. Contributing to the loss of life was the Coast Guard's failure to provide proper risk assessment training to Station Cleveland Harbor search and rescue personnel.  A form used to record important data and information about the vessel in distress. The form is vital for ensuring that cases are properly assessed and prosecuted.

Murphy  and Fokwa Ambe                                                                                                               Penn State                                                                                        This                      publication is the third in a series of five-year Pennsylvania                      farm fatality summaries. The first two publications were Pennsylvania                      Farm Fatalities During 1980-84 (Special Circular 319) and                      Pennsylvania Farm Fatalities During 1985-89 (Extension Circular                      390). The data summarized in this new publication come from                      death certificates and newspaper clippings. Information about                      some cases has been supplemented by other sources, includ-ing                      workers' compensation injury reports and police investigations.                      The data in this report cannot be compared directly with the                      data in previous reports because injury classification methods                      changed in 1990. These changes are explained below and in                      other sections of this report.                       This                      publication introduces the Farm and Agricultural Injury Classification                      (FAIC) code to the general public as a way to categorize and                      describe fatal injury incidents associated with farms and                      agriculture. Because it uses the FAIC code, this report includes                      some cases that would have been excluded from earlier reports.                      For example, many cases in FAIC categories -05 to -11 would                      have been excluded from previous reports, even though they                      are of direct interest to many people concerned about preventing                      agricultural injury.                                            Classifying farm                    fatalities                                        Classifying unintentional agricultural fatalities is not an                    exact science. Because the term “agricultural” is sometimes                    used interchangeably with “rural” and “farm,” classifying injury                    reports is a subjective task. Furthermore, since most farm residences                    are located at agricultural work sites, it often is hard to                    distinguish between work and nonwork injury cases, especially                    when the victim is a child. In addition, much of the work done                    on farms and in rural areas is not agricul-tural production,                    or farming. Finally, not all work on a farm is done by a farm                    worker. For example, an outside contrac-tor erecting a building                    on a farm is certainly working on a farm, but the work is not                    production agriculture. It is construction work, and an injury                    to one of the workers should be attributed to the construction                    industry, not the agricultural industry.                        The                      Farm and Agricultural Injury Classification code has been                      established to ensure more consistency in coding injury incidents                      related to farms and agriculture in Pennsylvania. It provides                      a rationale for consistent categorization of occupational                      (e.g., farming/farm produc-tion work) and nonoccupational                      (e.g., nonfarm production work/farm lifestyle) fatalities                      associated with farms and agriculture. This helps to identify                      situational exposures that are unique to farming and farm                      lifestyles. Table 1 identifies FAIC code categories and provides                      the number of fatality cases in each category from 1990-94.                      FAIC code categories are explained in the Appendix. Forty                      fatality cases could not be catego-rized because of a lack                      of information.

Table 1 shows that fatal injuries associated with                      the occupation of farming (Farm Production Work, FAIC-01)                      represent nearly all the cases, 103 of 105, associ-ated with                      agriculture as an industry (FAIC codes -01-04). However, agricul-tural                      occupational work incidents account for only about one-half                      (103 of 210) of the total cases associated with farms and                      farm lifestyles. The remaining cases for which a FAIC designation                      could be made (65 of 105) are distributed throughout the categories                      that represent the overlap between farms as work sites, residences,                      and recreational areas (FAIC-05 to -11). The two categories                      with the majority of the remaining assigned cases (45 of 65)                      are associated with using farm machines, tools, buildings,                      etc., for nonfarm production purposes (FAIC-05, 18 cases),                      and with children and others being exposed to farm work site                      hazards (FAIC-06, 27 cases). A common FAIC-05 incident might                      involve a person, living on a farm or in a rural area, using                      a farm tractor and wagon to cut and haul firewood for personal                      use. A common FAIC-06 incident might involve a young child                      falling from a tractor while being carried as an extra rider,                      or a child falling through a floor opening while playing in                      a barn.

As noted earlier, the recent introduction of the FAIC                    code prevents direct comparison between the data in this report                    and the data in previous reports. Therefore, this report also                    introduces other changes in data presentation. While deaths                    per number of farms is a good monitoring indicator, deaths per                    land in farms (LIF) is better because it more accurately reflects                    hazard exposures associated with farming. Table 2 presents fatalities                    per million acres of land in farms. The number of deaths and                    the death rate per million acres of LIF varied over the five-year                    period. As Table 2 illustrates, a one-year decrease or increase                    in deaths or the death rate does not indicate a trend.                                                              Fatalities by cooperative extension region                                        Penn State Cooperative Extension has divided the Commonwealth                    into four administrative regions. Figure 1 shows the counties                    in each region and the percentages of farm and agricultural                    fatalities and LIF in each region. The Southeast and West regions                    have slightly higher percentages of deaths than they do LIF.                    The largest differential is in the Central region, where the                    percentage of deaths was 6.7 percent less than the percentage                    of LIF. Tables 3 through 6 list counties by region and show                    the percent-ages of deaths and LIF that each county contributes                    toward the regional total. These tables show that some counties                    contribute a greater number of fatalities toward their region's                    totals than others. For example, in counties with at least 10                    fatalities, York County in the Southeast region and Butler and                    Westmoreland counties in the West region had approxi-mately                    twice the percentage of their region's fatality cases as they                    did their region's LIF (Tables 5 and 6). The data also show                    that when a county has a large percentage of cases, it doesn't                    mean that the county has had more than its share of incidents.                    For example, Lancaster County had 18.8 percent of the cases                    in the Southeast region, the second highest percentage in that                    region, but it also had the highest percentage of the LIF in                    the region, with 17.3 percent of the regional total (Table 5).

Such details as the victim's age, the activity he or                    she was engaged in, and the time the incident occurred are necessary                    for effective injury prevention planning. Several tables and                    figures are presented to give readers an overall picture of                    Pennsylvania farm and agricultural fatality incidents.                         Figure                      2  combines age groups of victims with the FAIC code categories.                      Appropriate information was available for 209 of the 210 cases.                      The graph shows the diversity of farm and agricul-tural fatal                      injury incidents while also illustrating how some types of                      incidents largely affect specific age groups. For instance,                      children 0 to 4 years of age and 5 to 9 years of age were                      most often killed (21 of 27 incidents) by exposure to farm                      work site hazards even though they were not actively engaged                      in farm work at the time (FAIC-06). More than twice as many                      senior farmers, 70 to 74 years of age, were killed during                      farm production work than were members of any other age group.                      Twenty-three farmers 70 to 74 years of age were killed during                      farm production work; victims 55 to 59 years of age had the                      next highest number of fatalities, with 11 cases.  Figure                      2  also shows that a substantial number of the FAIC-05                      incidents, 11 of 18 cases, involved people age 60 and over.

Nearly                      two-thirds of the incidents, 62.4 percent, occurred between                      9:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. This is not surprising. When viewed                      in combination with the day of week data, this appears to                      suggest that no particular time of day or day of the week                      clearly stands out as a prime time for fatal injury incidents.                      However, combining the data from Table 7 with the data from                      Figure 3 brings the picture into better focus. Figure 3 shows                      fatality cases by the month in which they occurred. The majority                      of cases, 52 percent of the total, occurred during the late                      spring and summer months of May through August. This is the                      season when children and adolescents are out of school and                      are more exposed to farm hazards. These months also are a                      peak time for farm field work. The combined data from Table                      7 and Figure 3 suggest that fatal injuries are most likely                      to occur between 9:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. any day of the week                      between May and August. Injury prevention programs, strategies,                      and messages should target this time period.

Table                      8 contains data for the 153 cases that were related to tractors                      and machinery, which accounted for 72.9 percent of the total                      number of incidents (210). Tractors were the major source                      of injury in 73.9 percent (113) of the 153 tractor and machinery                      incidents. The remaining 26.1 percent (40) involved a wide                      variety of other self-propelled and towed machines, or could                      not be specifically identified. Overturns accounted for nearly                      two-thirds of tractor-related fatalities (72 of 113, or 63.7                      percent). Twenty-nine tractor incidents involved people being                      run over; almost three-fourths of these cases (21 of 29, or                      72.4 percent) involved tractor operators who were run over                      by the tractor they were operating. The majority of these                      cases occurred during attempts to jump-start the tractor,                      or when the tractor rolled after the operator dismounted for                      some reason. There were no tractor power take-off (PTO) stub                      or other types of entanglement injuries. Nine cases (8 percent)                      fell into the Tractor, Other category. Three cases could not                      be categorized due to a lack of detailed information.                       As Table                      8 shows, a broad array of self-propelled and towed machines                      are involved in a wide variety of fatality incidents on farms                      and in agriculture. However, bunching some cases reveals significant                      information for people interested in injury prevention. Eight                      of 16 incidents (50 percent) involving runovers by towed wagons                      and field machines happened either to riders on the equipment                      or to bystanders. Six of these eight cases (75 percent) involved                      children under 10 years of age, with four of the six victims                      between one and three years of age. The largest grouping of                      nontractor incidents (17 of 40, or 42.5 percent) involved                      machine entanglement. Nearly all the entanglements were associated                      with the machine's PTO shaft (seven of 17, or 41.2 percent)                      or with the machine's crop/material intake or processing area                      (nine of 17, or 52.9 percent). Another 25 percent (10) of                      nontractor incidents fell into the Other category, a catch-all                      group of incidents. The most frequent incident in this group                      was injury associated with the bucket on skid-steer loaders                      (three cases).

No single category stands out as in-volved                      most often in these incidents, and the data show that there                      are a number of different ways to be fatally injured. A farm                      structure such as a pond or silo was mentioned most often                      as the thing involved in the fatal incident (10 cases, or                      17.5 percent). This was closely followed by buildings; animals;                      and miscellaneous farm objects, materials, or products, each                      of which had 8 cases (14 percent). Four of the eight falls                      (50 percent) associated with buildings were falls off of a                      roof. Two of the remaining falls (25 percent) involved small                      children falling through barn hay drop openings. Eight of                      the 10 incidents (80 percent) involving farm structures were                      drownings, all occurring in farm ponds. Six of the eight (75                      percent) animal- related incidents were attacks and kicks                      by animals, including bulls (two), cows (two), a horse, and                      a mule. The other two incidents (25 percent) were falls from                      horses.                       The                      five Motor vehicle/Struck by incidents include one vehicle/train                      crash; a raised truck bed falling on the victim; one crash                      involving two vehicles; and two farm truck drivers who had                      stopped along a roadway, stepped out of their trucks, and                      then were struck by other vehicles. Each victim was engaged                      in farm production work at the time of the incident. There                      probably are many more farm production work fatality incidents                      that involve motor vehicles, but go unreported.                                                                     Figure                      4 shows fatal incidents by age groups. The data are consistent                      with, though not directly comparable to, previous summary                      reports showing that children age 14 and under and farm workers                      age 65 and over accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total                      number of cases. The two age groups accounted for 47.7 percent                      of the total during 1990-94; 49.7 percent during 1985-89;                      and 41.3 percent during 1980-84. Children age 14 and under                      and workers age 65 and over usually are not found in other                      hazardous occupations. Children age 14 and under often are                      untrained, inexperienced, not closely supervised, and emotionally                      and physically immature. On the other hand, the ability of                      aged workers to respond to danger often is limited as some                      effects of aging, such as slower reactions or decreased physical                      mobility, begin to have a pronounced influence on risk and                      hazard avoidance. On the surface, it appears that the risk                      of injury increases significantly at about age 70.                                                               Fatal injuries                    to at-risk groups                                         Table                    10 has fatalities occurring to youth age 14 and under and senior                    farmers age 65 and over by type of incident. Tractors and machinery                    were associated with 19 of 31 (61.3 percent) incidents involving                    youth and 59 of 70 (84.3 percent) incidents involving senior                    farmers. While tractor and machinery incidents were the primary                    cause of fatal injury for both age groups, each group was affected                    by quite different types of tractor and machinery incidents.                    Only two overturn incidents involved young operators, accounting                    for 10.5 percent of their total tractor and machinery incidents.                    How-ever, senior farmers were involved in 30 overturn incidents,                    accounting for 50.8 percent of their total tractor and machin-ery                    incidents.

Youth                      age 14 and under were run over while being a rider in six                      of 14 cases (42.9 percent) or while being a bystander or on-the-ground                      helper in eight cases (57.1 percent). Senior farmers, on the                      other hand, almost always were run over while working with                      or around the tractor as the operator, a scenario that occurred                      in 14 of 16 cases, or 87.6 percent of the runover cases for                      their age group. In many of these cases, an operator was trying                      to jump-start a tractor while standing on the ground, thinking                      that the tractor was out of gear. There also were a number                      of incidents in which the tractor rolled as a senior farmer                      attempted to hook or unhook equipment to the tractor. In some                      cases the tractor was left in neutral, in others the brakes                      reportedly did not hold.                       The                      three youth group incidents involving machinery other than                      tractors were entanglements with the machine; however, none                      of the entanglements involved the machine's PTO shaft. The                      same is not true for senior farmers. Four of seven (57.1 percent)                      nontractor machinery incidents involving senior farmers were                      entanglements with the PTO shaft. The other three incidents                      (42.9 percent) were entanglements in the crop/product intake                      or processing area. In six cases involving senior farmers,                      there was insufficient information to determine the specific                      type of machinery in the incident.                       There                      were 12 incidents unrelated to tractors and machinery among                      the youth group, accounting for 38.7 percent of their total.                      There were 10 of these incidents among senior farmers, account-ing                      for 14.3 percent of their total. Three of the 12 (25 percent)                      incidents involv-ing youth were drownings in farm ponds. One                      child was trampled by a cow and two children fell through                      a barn hay drop opening. The rest of the fatalities were spread                      among a variety of other incident types. Nine of the 10 (90                      percent) incidents unrelated to tractors and machinery involving                      senior farmers were spread among a variety of types. An animal                      was involved in only one case, in which the victim was kicked                      by a horse. The remaining case involving a senior farmer lacked                      detailed information.

Dense smoke and heat spread upward to a deck on which crew quarters were located. Five crewmembers died from smoke inhalation, and 55 crewmembers and 1 passenger sustained minor or serious injuries. One passenger required medical treatment as a result of a pre-existing condition. Sixty-nine people were transported to area hospitals, where 13 of the injured were admitted for further treatment. The estimated damage to the vessel was $1.5 million. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was a lack of effective oversight by New Commodore Cruise Lines, Ltd., and the predecessor of V. Ships Marine, Ltd. (International Marine Carriers, Inc.), who allowed physical conditions and operating procedures to exist that compromised the fire safety of the Universe Explorer, ultimately resulting in crewmember deaths and injuries from a fire of undetermined origin in the vessel's main laundry. Contributing to the loss of life and injuries was the lack of sprinkler systems, the lack of automatic localsounding fire alarms, and the rapid spread of smoke through open doors into the crew berthing area. The major safety issues discussed in this report are the adequacy of shipboard communications; the adequacy of fire prevention, detection, and control measures; the adequacy of emergency procedures; and the adequacy of oversight. As a result of its investigation of this accident, the Safety Board makes recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard, New Commodore Cruise Lines, Ltd., V. Ships Marine, Ltd., the International Council of Cruise Lines, and the American Bureau of Shipping.  vii   INVESTIGATION On July 27, 1996, shortly before 0300,1 a fire started in the main laundry of the Panamanian passenger ship Universe Explorer (figure 1), which was en route from Juneau, Alaska, to Glacier Bay, Alaska, with 1,006 people aboard. Dense smoke and heat spread upward two levels from the deck on which the main laundry was located to a deck on which crew quarters were located. Five crewmembers died from smoke inhalation, and 55 crewmembers and 1 passenger sustained minor or serious injuries. One passenger required medical treatment as a result of a pre-existing condition. Sixty-nine people were transported to area hospitals, where 13 victims of serious injuries were admitted for further treatment. The following narrative is based on interviews with crewmembers and surveys with passengers. crew left the laundry area together. They then ate dinner as a group and went ashore for a sightseeing excursion in Juneau.  Accident Narrative On July 23, 1996, the Universe Explorer departed Vancouver, British Columbia, with 732 passengers and 274 crewmembers on board for a pleasure cruise of Alaskan waters. The cruise itinerary was north, through the Inside Passage, to Ketchikan, Juneau, Glacier Bay, Wrangell, and then back to Vancouver. About 1030, on July 26, the Universe Explorer arrived at the Juneau, Alaska, Municipal Dock, where it remained moored all day. According to the master, the trip from Vancouver was without incident. He received no reports of mechanical problems with the ship or with any equipment aboard the ship, including the machinery in the ship's main laundry. The laundry manager stated that he personally cleaned the clothes dryers' lint traps about 1745 in preparation for shutting down the main laundry for the night at 1800. He said that after shutting off all machinery, the entire laundry 1  Figure 1--The Universe Explorer  About midnight, the cruise ship departed Juneau bound for Glacier Bay. The master retired to his cabin about 0240 on July 27, 1996, leaving instructions with the watch officer to call him at 0500 or earlier should any problem occur. The master said that when he left the bridge, no problems of any kind had been reported on the ship. After the master left, the navigation watch consisted of a pilot, the second officer, a helmsman, and a lookout. About this time, the ship had rounded Retreat Point and was entering the Lynn Canal (figure 2). About 0250, the fire watch returned to the navigation bridge after completing his 0200round of the ship and reported that everything was ""okay"" to the watch officer. Shortly before 0300, the fire watch left the bridge on his next  All times are local, based on a 24-hour clock.   2  Figure 2--Location of the Universe Explorer when the fire occurred.  round. At 0259,2 an audible heat-detector alarm sounded on the fire alarm panel on the bridge (figure 3). The second officer said he noted that the panel indicated the activated heat detector was in the main laundry on E-deck (figure 4). Thinking it might be a false alarm, he used a UHF radio to call and instruct the fire watch to investigate the alarm source in the main laundry. The fire watch said that he was on the Promenade deck near the swimming pool when he received the call and that, after acknowledging the radio transmission, he started toward the main laundry. The second officer said that he had started to check the ship's navigational position when a second audible alarm on the fire alarm panel sounded less than a minute later. He said that he became highly concerned because a second alarm typically did not sound in a false alarm situation; he immediately focused his attention on the fire alarm panel. The alarm printout indicated that a smoke detector had activated in the fan room on the Aloha deck near break no. 1 (figure 5). Using a UHF radio, the second officer called the fire watchman, but heard no response, although the fire watch had heard and acknowledged the transmission from the bridge. The second officer 2  then transmitted, ""If you can hear me, report [by radio] to the bridge and then go to the Aloha deck fan room."" He said that when he did not receive any response, he repeated the message. The second officer said that multiple fire alarms then began to activate on the fire alarm panel faster than he could read the printout. He immediately telephoned the master, the staff captain, and the safety officer to come to the bridge. He said all three officers arrived on the bridge within a minute. The master said that when he arrived on the bridge, he immediately ordered the engines stopped, the remotely operated fire doors closed, the power ventilation shut down, and the code phrase ""Mr. Skylight""3 announced over the public address system. Meanwhile, in response to the second officer's second radio call, the fire watch had gone down to the Main deck. The fire watch said he was walking forward, intending to go to the fan room as instructed; however, he could not reach break no. 1 because he encountered thick smoke. He said that he realized his radio was ineffective from his location, so he tried to use the ship's ""Mr. Skylight"" was a code phrase broadcast to alert the crew to report to their emergency stations. The Universe Explorer had two fire teams, each consisting of 10 people, including a fire team leader. Fire team no. 1 was composed of deck department personnel, and fire team no. 2 was composed of engineering department personnel. 3  The fire alarm panel printout indicates that this alarm sounded at 0256. According to the vessel operator, the fire alarm panel clock was about 3 minutes slow.   3 Log of Activated Detectors Time of Activation 0256:42 0257:32 0257:35 0257:44 0257:48 0257:53 0258:01 0258:26 0258:41 0300:30 Location of Alarm Main Laundry - E deck Fan Room - Aloha deck Stairwell - Aloha deck Conveyor room - Aloha deck Break no. 1, port side - Aloha deck Main laundry, port side - E deck Spiral stair near break 1 - Aloha deck Corridor near print shop - Aloha deck Main laundry starboard side - E deck Corridor to crew cabins - Aloha deck  Between 0300:31 and 0301.50, 23 smoke detectors activated, of which 11 were in stairways and corridors. 0301:51 0301:53 0301:55 Crew cabin CA 14 - Aloha deck Crew cabin CB 5 - Bali deck Crew cabin CB 14 - Bali deck  A total of 64 smoke alarms sounded within 7 minutes of the first heat detector alarm.

The telephone to the bridge was busy, so he began running to the bridge. He said that before reaching the bridge, he heard the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement and immediately went to his emergency station. After noting the indicated location of the activated fire detectors, the safety officer left the bridge and proceeded to the emergency gear locker at fire station no. 1 on the Boat deck to obtain a breathing apparatus. There he met the junior second officer, who was the leader of fire team no. 1, and instructed him to assemble his team in the foyer near the purser's office.  The safety officer then left fire station no. 1 alone to begin searching for the exact location of the fire. As he was descending the forward passenger stairway, he encountered smoke at the Main deck level, whereupon he radioed the bridge.

He said that when he opened the fire door, he encountered heavy black smoke and ""tremendous"" heat. He immediately closed the door and returned to the foyer area where fire team no. 1 had assembled on the Main deck. He instructed the team to prepare to make entry once he had located the fire source and told the team leader to accompany him to find the exact location of the fire. The safety officer and the fire team no. 1 leader provided different estimates of how long the two of them searched before finding the source of the fire. The safety officer estimated that they discovered the fire about 35 minutes  after they began searching; the fire team leader estimated that they found the fire about 45 minutes after they began searching. The two men first descended to Aloha deck and went forward through the starboard-side passageway. When they opened the closed fire door at break no. 1, they were driven back by ""tremendous smoke."" They then descended to Bali deck, where they noted high levels of heat, especially near the hospital, but less smoke and no flames. They proceeded to the forward-most stairway on Bali deck and ascended to Aloha deck, where they heard people calling for help. They located 10 crewmembers trapped in their cabins by heavy smoke and led them to safety.   5  The deceased crewmembers were assigned to Aloha deck cabins (CA) 28, 22, 18, and 14.  Figure 5--Plan view of Aloha deck. The second fire alarm that sounded on the bridge was triggered by a smoke detector in the fan room near break no. 1, an athwartship passageway. The nearby spiral staircase extended down from the Aloha deck to the Hold deck. On E deck, this stairway accessed the forward portion of the main laundry. The doors to the spiral stairway were remotely operated fire doors that remained open until closed by the bridge.  The safety officer then received a radio call from the bridge to proceed to the crew galley on Bali deck, where fire team no. 2 had assembled. After complying with the radio call, the safety officer and the leader of fire team no. 1 descended a stairway aft of the galley to E deck and walked forward to the watertight door aft of the main laundry. When they opened the door, they encountered ""heavy black smoke,"" which they walked through. Upon entering the main laundry, they saw flames on the steam napkin press and in laundry bins next to the forward bulkhead of the laundry. The safety officer said  that material in the laundry bins was on fire and that there were large volumes of black smoke. The safety officer and the fire team no. 1 leader began to battle the blaze using extinguishers and charged fire hoses from fire stations near the main laundry. The safety officer radioed a report of the fire location to the bridge, instructing the staff engineer to have the electrician shut off the electricity to the main laundry and to have fire team no. 2 come to the laundry. The safety officer and the fire team no. 1 leader then took turns directing the water from one hose while fire team no. 2 personnel   6 Table 1--Injuries Sustained in Universe Explorer Accident  PASSENGERS FATAL SERIOUS MINOR NONE TOTAL 0 1 1 730 732  CREW 5 12 43 214 274  TOTAL 5 13 44 944 1,006  49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 830.2 defines fatal injury as ""any injury which results in death within 30 days of the accident"" and serious injury as ""an injury which: (1) requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date the injury was received; (2) results in a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose); (3) causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, or tendon damage; (4) involves any internal organ; or (5) involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burn affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface.""  directed water from the second hose on the fire until they brought it under control, which was between 0410 and 0415. The vessel firefighters extinguished the fire by 0615. After examining the main laundry and surrounding areas, the safety officer set up a reflash watch. About 0730, he noticed white smoke emanating from wiring in the overhead. Even though he did not see any sparks or flames, as a precaution, he radioed the bridge to report a reflash of the fire. Meanwhile, the fire team no. 1 leader discharged several portable CO2 fire extinguishers on the smoking wiring, and the electrician completely shut off all electric power 5 to main vertical zones (MVZs) nos. 1 and 2, except for the emergency lights. Following the discharge of the CO2 extinguishers, the wires stopped smoking. As soon as the fire was discovered, the master ordered the vessel to proceed to anchorage in Auke Bay, where passengers and injured crew were transferred ashore. The fire resulted 5  in the death of five crewmembers on Aloha deck. Rescuers found the bodies of three deceased crewmen in the passageway about 0325 and two deceased crewmen in their cabins about 0540. A total of 67 crewmembers and 2 passengers were transported to area hospitals where, after preliminary examination, 57 required treatment.  Injuries Table 1 is based on the injury criteria of the International Civil Aviation Organization, which the Safety Board uses in accident reports for all transportation modes.  Damages A representative for the operating company of the Universe Explorer estimated the total damages to the vessel at $1.5 million.  Personnel Information General--According to the official crew list, the Universe Explorer was staffed by a multinational crew of 274 individuals. The master was a U.S. citizen; the staff captain was a Norwegian citizen; and most of the other licensed officers were Greek, Philippine, or U.S.  A vessel's hull, superstructure, and deckhouses are sectioned into main vertical zones, which generally do not exceed a mean length of 131 feet on any one deck and which are divided by fire-resisting bulkheads. Additional information about the structural requirements of MVZs appears under Vessel Information.   7 citizens. About half of the crewmembers were Philippine citizens; the rest were of various nationalities. The common language for communication was English. All were properly licensed or certificated under Panamanian law. Information about crew training in emergency response and evacuation procedures appears in the Survival Factors section of this report. The Safety Board examined the certification and work experience for the five licensed officers who had prominent roles in the response. May 1982, following his graduation from the Croatian Maritime Academy in September 1981. Between August 1985 and May 1990, he worked ashore. He resumed sailing in 1990 and had served on cruise ships since then. He had been most recently licensed as a first officer of ocean-going vessels of any gross tonnage on January 17, 1995, by the Republic of Panama. In July 1991, the safety officer completed a 7-day course in Coast Guard-approved basic and advanced shipboard firefighting conducted by Delgado Community College in New Orleans, Louisiana. He had served as the safety officer on the Universe Explorer since November 1994, which required that he maintain the lifesaving equipment and train the crew in emergency response procedures.  Master--The Universe Explorer master, age 56, began sailing in 1958. He received his original (German) master's license in 1969 and had accumulated 15 years' experience as a master at the time of the accident. He had been most recently licensed as a master of oceangoing vessels of any gross tonnage on August 12, 1993, by the Republic of Panama. His past experience included duty assignments as safety officer and staff captain on various vessels and director of marine operations for Commodore Cruise Lines. Before joining the Universe Explorer on July 19, 1996, he served as master of a sister ship, the Enchanted Isle, from February to June 1996. Staff Captain--A duty of the staff captain, age 53, was to serve as rescue coordinator during emergencies. He began sailing when he was 16 years old and received his original (Norwegian) master's license in 1974. He had been most recently licensed as a master of oceangoing vessels of any gross tonnage on October 22, 1992, by the Republic of Panama. He had sailed as chief officer, staff captain, and master of several different types of cargo and passenger vessels. From 1986 to 1992, he was vice president of operations for Palm Beach Cruises. He returned to sea in 1992, serving in succession on the following vessels: the Enchanted Isle, the Crown Dynasty, the Crown Jewel, and the Universe Explorer. Safety Officer--During emergencies, the safety officer, age 34, served as the on-scene commander. He began sailing on cargo ships in  Senior Second Officer--On the evening of the accident, the senior second officer, age 41, was standing the 0000-0400 watch. He began sailing in May 1980, following his graduation from the California Maritime College. He received his original master's license (U.S.) in 1988 and had sailed for 5 years as master on cruise ships and cargo ships. He had been most recently licensed as master of ocean-going vessels of any gross tonnage on March 24, 1995, by the Republic of Panama. He joined the Universe Explorer as senior second officer on July 20, 1996.  Junior Second Officer--A secondary duty of the junior second officer, age 31, was to serve as the leader of fire team no. 1. He graduated from the State University of New York Maritime College in January 1990 with a B.S. degree in electrical engineering and dual licenses as third mate and third assistant engineer. His cadet training also included firefighting training. He had been most recently licensed as first officer of ocean-going vessels of any gross tonnage on July 17, 1996, by the Republic of Panama. Since his graduation from college, he had served in a variety of assignments for several companies. On July 20, 1996, he joined Commodore Cruise Lines as junior second officer on board the Universe Explorer.   8  Vessel Information History--The Universe Explorer was built as a combination passenger/cargo ship in 1958 by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Named the SS Brasil by its original owner, Moore-McCormack Lines, the vessel sailed under U.S. registry until 1972, when its then new owner, Holland America Lines, placed it under Netherlands Antilles registry and renamed it the Volendam. The ship has been sold and renamed several times. After Holland America, the following companies purchased the vessel in the years indicated: Banstead Shipping Ltd., 1987; Orley Shipping Company, Inc., 1987; Bermuda Star Line, Inc., 1989; Brazil Caribbean Shipping Co., Inc., 1993; and Azure Investments, Inc., 1995. According to the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), with which the vessel was classed at the time, the ship was placed under Panamanian flag in September 1975. The vessel transferred class to Lloyd's Register of Shipping (LR) in 1976 and returned to ABS class in 1984. In 1990, Bermuda Star Line, Inc., which operated the vessel under the name the Queen of Bermuda, consolidated with Commodore Cruise Lines, and the ship was renamed the Enchanted Seas. From 1990 until April 1995, Commodore Cruise Lines operated the vessel on weekly pleasure cruises from New Orleans. The vessel was then taken out of service and placed in a lay-up status until it was sold to its present owner. Before purchasing the vessel, representatives for the prospective owner, Azure Investments, Inc., a Panamanian corporation, and Coast Guard officials discussed its compliance with amendments to The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 74), requirements established by the Interna6 tional Maritime Organization (IMO). Coast Guard files contain a record of a March 29, 1995, telephone conversation with the prospecThe IMO, a United Nations organization comprising 137 member states, establishes international maritime safety standards for the ships of nations that are signatories to the SOLAS conventions. 6  tive owner's representative indicating that the vessel would comply with applicable fire safety requirements adopted by IMO in May 1992. In April 1995, representatives for Azure Investments, met with senior Coast Guard officials to discuss possibly reflagging the vessel under U.S. flag. Toward this effort, they asked that the Coast Guard provide a copy of its complete file of records concerning the Universe Explorer, then named the Enchanted Seas. The prospective owner subsequently had inspections of the vessel performed by various marine technical specialists, who determined that the vessel could be returned to U.S. flag, including making upgrades to bring it into compliance with SOLAS requirements effective in October 1997, at a cost that the owner termed a ""reasonable expense."" The new SOLAS requirements, commonly known as the Retroactive Fire Safety Amendments (RFSAs), are discussed in the Other section of this report. For the project of complying with the RFSAs, Petrochem Marine Consultants (PMC), whose principals were three former Coast Guard technical staff members, was designated as the design agent and point of contact. On July 15, 1995, Azure Investments, the present owner, purchased the vessel and 7 changed its name to Universe Explorer. Some time after purchasing the vessel, the vessel owner elected to put the proposed reflagging project ""on hold."" Azure Investments chartered the vessel to New Commodore Cruise Lines, Ltd. (New Commodore), a Bermuda corporation, which operated as Commodore Cruise Lines. New Commodore, in turn, contracted International  In addition to the names listed above, the ship has sailed as the Canada Star, the Liberte, the Island Sun, and the Monarch Sun.  7   9 Marine Carriers, Inc., a New York corporation, 8 to manage and operate the ship. The Universe Explorer remained out of service another 6 months. Between October 1995 and January 1996, it underwent modifications to prepare it for operating under charter to the Institute for Shipboard Education, which operates a college program in association with the University of Pittsburgh. The vessel's casino was converted into a library and computer center, and other areas were partitioned for classrooms. In November 1995, officials from the Coast Guard Marine Safety Center (MSC) wrote the vessel operator reminding the company that all passenger vessels constructed before October 1, 1994, were subject to the RFSAs. The Coast Guard enclosed a copy of the new requirements and a copy of guidelines for meeting the requirements. In January 1996, the Universe Explorer was returned to service, sailing on a Caribbean pleasure cruise, which ended February 3, 1996. The vessel then departed on its first semester voyage for the Institute for Shipboard Education, which ended in mid-May. On May 21, 1996, the vessel departed Ensenada, Mexico, on a summer semester voyage, which ended on July 19, 1996, in Seattle, Washington. After disembarking university students, faculty, and administrative staff in Seattle, the Universe Explorer went to Canada, from where it departed Vancouver on July 23, 1996, for a pleasure cruise of Alaskan waters. During this 8  cruise, the fire that is the subject of this report occurred in the main laundry on E deck.  General Construction--The steamturbine-propelled Universe Explorer is 617.5 feet long, 84 feet wide, and has a displacement of 22,526 tons. The vessel has 10 decks (figure 4) and is vertically divided by 5 MVZ bulkheads that are ""A-class divisions,"" meaning they are insulated steel barriers designed to prevent the passage of smoke and flame from a fire for 1 hour. The vessel was built to SOLAS 1948 requirements and to U.S. standards (46 CFR Parts 70 to 89). It was designed according to ""Method I"" construction, meaning that ""noncombustible"" materials were to be used and that structural fire boundaries were to be built throughout the vessel to ensure any fire would be restricted to its compartment of origin. The method I standards require strict attention to construction details and certification of the noncombustible nature of the materials used. To maintain the structural fire protection afforded by this method of construction, all modifications to the vessel have to be made either to original construction standards or to higher structural standards in effect at the time of the modification. No structural alteration can be made that may reduce the level of fire safety. A method I-built ship was not required to have, and the original owner of the vessel did not install, automatic sprinkler systems. Guard correspondence indicates the vessel underwent structural modifications in Baltimore, Maryland, between 1962 and 1963 to U.S. standards, in Bremerhaven, Germany, between 1972 and 1973 to SOLAS 60 standards, in Hampton Roads, Virginia, between 1974 and 1978 to SOLAS 60 standards, in Sasebo, Japan, in 1985 to SOLAS 74 standards, and in Avondale, Louisiana, in 1990 to SOLAS 74 standards. The Coast Guard files do not indicate the nature and extent of the modifications.  Modifications--Coast  At the time of the accident, International Marine Carriers, Inc., was in the process of forming a joint venture company with V. Ships Marine, USA. Because International Marine Carriers, Inc., no longer exists, this report henceforth refers to V. Ships Marine, Ltd. (V. Ships) as the vessel operating company. V. Ships is a large ship management company with offices in Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America employing 250 shore-based staff and more than 4,500 seafarers. The company manages various types of merchant ships, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships.   10 A copy of 1964 plans obtained from the U.S. Maritime Administration (MarAd) archives shows that at that time the vessel had two cargo hatches forward of the deckhouse and one hatch aft of the deckhouse. Current plans show that the cargo hatch areas have been converted to offices and crew accommodation spaces on the Main, Bali, and Aloha decks. Structural modifications have been made to the Boat deck, Promenade deck, and Upper deck, the latter of which now has a 75-foot extension. Numerous modifications have been made to interior spaces and furnishings. In 1989, the Universe Explorer's sister ship, which was built to the same method I construction standards, suffered a major fire that damaged 22 cabins while the vessel was undergoing shipyard repairs. As a result of the fire, Coast Guard inspectors determined that both vessels had combustible insulation throughout their interiors. The Coast Guard subsequently required that this insulation be removed from both vessels as a condition of their being allowed to continue embarking passengers in the 9 United States. Further, as an interim measure, the Coast Guard required that additional smoke detectors be installed and that the number of roving fire patrols be increased until the insulation removal was completed. Coast Guard records indicate that the removal project was completed for both vessels in January 1991. However, the records also note that some insulation could not be removed because it was in inaccessible areas. Aloha deck. The spiral stairway opening onto the forward end of the laundry also opened onto the Hold deck and the Aloha deck. The steel fire screen doors in these stairways were electromagnetically controlled. During normal operations, a magnetic field created by an electric current held the doors open. In the event of an emergency, the fire screen doors could be closed either remotely from the bridge or at the door position by a person shutting off the electrical current switch. The fire screen doors then shut under their own weight, assisted by a spring-loaded closing mechanism. The aft access to the main laundry had a power-activated sliding watertight door that was operable locally and remotely from the navigation bridge. The laundry manager said that the laundry doors were not locked after the laundry crew went off duty so that crewmembers could bring soiled uniforms and linen to the laundry after operations had ceased for the day. Rooms for linen storage and cleaning and valet service were along the port side of the laundry. The laundry manager stated that the doors to these linen and service rooms were usually closed when the rooms were not in use. An unused parcel lift and a mail chute were near the spiral stairway. Safety Board investigators found the access hatches to both the lift and the chute tightly closed after the fire.  Main Laundry--The fire on the Universe Explorer ignited in the main laundry on E deck within MVZ no. 2. The main laundry area was accessible by two stairways, each of which was enclosed in a vertical A-class trunk. Both stairwells extended from Hold deck to Aloha deck. The stairwell opening onto the aft end of the laundry also opened onto Bali deck and  Missing Bulkhead--Original vessel construction plans show that the main laundry was on the port side of the ship and enclosed by bulkheads (figure 6). The 1958 plans indicate the presence of a bulkhead in the main laundry that created a corridor from the spiral stairway on the forward end to the stairway on the aft end of the compartment, separating the storage and laundry areas from the stairways in accordance with 46 CFR 72.05-20 (f), which states the following:  9  The type and scope of Coast Guard examinations are discussed in greater detail later in this section.   11  Figure 6--(Left) Main laundry layout as originally designed with a bulkhead forming a corridor between the forward and aft stairways and separating the storage and laundry areas from the stairways in accordance with 46 CFR, the U.S. interpretation of SOLAS 48. (Center) Layout as modified in 1964 and as shown on the vessel control plan. (Right) Layout of the main laundry as found during the postaccident examination.  Insofar as is reasonable and practicable, 10 Types 1 & 2 stairways ...should not give direct access to accommodations or other enclosed spaces in which a fire may originate [footnote added]. The 1964 plans from the MarAd archives, which reflect the structural modifications made in Baltimore, indicate that the main laundry bulkhead forming the corridor between the forward and aft stairways was still in place, although the access door into the storage area had been moved. The Universe Explorer's fire control plan, which had been approved by the ABS in January 1991, also indicates the presence of the main laundry corridor bulkhead. SOLAS requirements at Regulation 20, ""Fire control plans,"" stipulate, in part:  In all ships general arrangement plans shall be permanently exhibited for the guidance of the ship's officers, showing clearly for each deck the control stations, the various fire sections enclosed by `A' class divisions, the sections enclosed by `B' class divisions together with particulars of the fire detection and fire alarm systems.... Plans...shall be kept up to date, any alterations being recorded thereon as soon as practicable. During postaccident examination, Safety Board investigators observed that most of the corridor bulkhead had been cut away; only the top 12 to 18 inches of the bulkhead extended down from the overhead structural deck. Vessel officers had no information about when or why this bulkhead had been removed. V. Ships, the Universe Explorer operator, subsequently provided information stating that the main laundry area was modified between 1972 and 1974 at the Lloyd-Werft Shipyard, when the ship was being operated by Holland America Lines. The Safety Board found no records showing the nature of the modifications or when they were made. Lloyd's  Type 1 stairways are enclosed stair towers bordering MVZs. Type 2 stairways are enclosed stairways other than type 1.  10   12 Register of Shipping (LR) advised the Safety Board that its file records indicate that ""the corridor bulkhead was in place during the period of Classification by LR"" and that none of its survey reports note its removal. The ABS stated that its files had no correspondence, drawings, or information indicating that it was ever advised the bulkhead was going to be or had been removed and that it did not know when the bulkhead was removed. However, the ABS further advised that the bulkhead was not required to be in place to comply either with the ABS classification requirements or the statutory requirements of the flag administration, Panama, at the time of the casualty. The ABS stated: This ship complies...with SOLAS 74/78, 11 as amended, as an existing ship using Method I Fire Protection as a basis when built plus SOLAS amendments, as applicable [footnote added]. After this accident, the Universe Explorer owner installed a bulkhead isolating the main laundry from direct access to both stairwells in compliance with the RFSAs. linens, towels, and washcloths. The laundry manager said that when he left the laundry at 1800 on the evening before the fire, all of the bins were piled high with soiled laundry, but no laundry was lying on the deck. During its postaccident examination of the area, the Safety Board was unable to verify whether the linen was clean or soiled or where it had been because firefighters had scattered the unburned linen to ensure that the fire was extinguished.  Welding Machines--To facilitate shipboard maintenance and repair, electric welding machines were stationed at various locations on the Universe Explorer. In the weeks before the fire, a welding machine had been in the main laundry for repair of a sewage tank below the main laundry, in the Hold. The welding machine was fastened to the deck and immediately starboard of the spiral stairway. Hot-work permits issued by the staff engineer indicate that welding was performed in the forward sewage tank area between June 26 and July 15, 1996. Various company employees stated that no hotwork permits were issued and no cutting or welding was done in or near the main laundry on the day before the fire. According to the ship's hotel manager, before the Universe Explorer arrived in Seattle, Washington, on July 19, 1996, the main laundry had received a general inspection by the master and was found to be in a satisfactory condition. The hotel manager further stated that no written report was made of these inspections. According to V. Ships, a written report typically is not prepared unless the master notes defects that require correction.  Laundry Equipment--The laundry machinery, which included five washers and seven dryers (figure 7), was electrically powered industrial equipment. Other machinery included a steam napkin press and a large roller press. According to the laundry manager, the napkin press was not turned on or used the day before the accident occurred. The laundry manager also stated that, in accordance with regular operating procedures, all laundry machinery was turned off at 1800 on the eve of the accident. Three large, solid-sided cylindrical fiberglass bins, each about 4 feet high and 30 inches in diameter, and four oblong solid-sided aluminum bins, each about 3 feet high, 3 feet wide, and 30 inches deep, were used as hampers for dirty linen, including uniforms, table linens, bed An ""existing ship"" means a vessel having a keel that is laid on or after the effective date of the particular Convention. 11  Postaccident Area Inspection--In the forwardmost cleaning room of the laundry, Safety Board investigators observed that the bulkhead had a new coat of paint and that an open can of waterbased paint and nonflammable painting and cleaning materials were on the deck. A description of the fire damage appears in the Wreckage section of this report.   13  The laundry manager said that when he completed work on July 26, 1996, four bins full of dirty linen were pushed up against the forward bulkhead near the doorway to the spiral stairway. Three laundry bins were near the steam press. The spiral stair led from the Hold to the Aloha deck, where crew quarters were located.  Figure 7--Main laundry area, showing the location of equipment.  Fire Systems and Equipment--The Universe Explorer was equipped with a fire detection and alarm system throughout the accommodation and services spaces. Components of the system are described below.  Flame detectors were in the boiler room, which extends between E deck and Bali deck. Whenever a detector activated, an indicator light was displayed and an alarm sounded on the fire alarm panel on the bridge; no local alarm automatically sounded in the area of the activated detector. Some detectors were ""addressable"" devices, which indicate their location; others were ""nonaddressable,"" which indicate only their identification number. To determine the location of an activated nonaddressable detector, one had to refer to the Fire Detection Plan. The fire alarm system recorded the time and location of activated addressable detectors. The bridge also monitored the opening and closing of the fire doors.  Fire detection system--The vessel's fire detection system used heat-actuated, smokeactuated, and flame-actuated sensor devices, each of which was depicted on the Fire Detection Plan. Smoke detectors were installed in the crew cabins, crew corridors, and crew service spaces on the Aloha and Bali decks and in the passenger cabins, passenger corridors, and public spaces on all other decks. Heat detectors were in the crew's galley, the main galley, and the main laundry.   14 During its postaccident investigation of the main laundry, the Safety Board noted that the area not only had addressable heat detectors but also several disconnected smoke detectors in the overhead that were not depicted on either the fire detection plan or the fire control plan. According to the vessel operator, the disconnected detectors were part of the original fire detection system that was replaced by the heat detector system in 19721974, when the main laundry was converted from a clean-linen storage area. Generally, heat detectors are less susceptible to false alarms than most smoke detectors. When the main laundry was revamped in the early 1970s, the smoke detectors were replaced with heat detectors. According to the manufacturer's representative, however, the model of heat detector used on the Universe Explorer is subject to false alarms if moisture accumulates on the electrical contacts at the base of the device.  Fire alarms--The vessel had manual fire alarms in the passenger and crew accommodation spaces on the vessel. The crew accommodation area forward on the Aloha deck had two pullcable-type manual alarms that register an audible and visual alarm only on the navigation bridge, and one push-button-type manual fire alarm that activates two local fire alarm bells. None of the manual alarms in the crew berthing area on the Aloha deck was activated by crewmembers during the fire.  Detector limitations--The Safety Board examined fire industry literature and conferred with an electrical engineer specializing in fire detection equipment regarding fire detection devices. The following paragraphs summarize recognized limitations inherent in the heat and smoke detector models installed on the Universe Explorer. Smoke detectors--The Universe Explorer had photoelectric (or optical) smoke detectors, which activate when a substance obscures a light beam from reaching the sensory cell. Smoke detectors can detect an early (incipient) fire when it begins to smolder, before it becomes fully developed (free burning). They can be susceptible to false alarms in laundry facilities because water vapor (humidity) or minute solid particles (lint and dust) can act like smoke in blocking the sensor and activating the device. Operators of commercial facilities having smoke detectors typically perform frequent maintenance of the devices to reduce the incidence of false alarms. Heat detectors--A fixed-temperature heat detector, such as the type installed in the main laundry of the Universe Explorer, operates only when the detector itself, not the surrounding air, 0 reaches a preset temperature, in this case 70 C 0 (157 F). Heat detectors lack the ability to detect a fire during its incipient stage because very little heat emanates from a smoldering fire that has not reached a free-burning stage. If the fire starts on or near the deck and the heat sensor is in the overhead, as was the case with the heat detector in the main laundry, the time it takes for the heat detector to actuate can be considerable.  Fire doors--All fire doors to the stairways were electromagnetically controlled. Power-actuated watertight doors were installed at each passage through a watertight boundary, including the bulkhead separating the main laundry from the aft stairwell, as required by SOLAS. All fire doors could be controlled remotely from the bridge. The master stated that he ordered the staff captain to close all power-actuated doors when he ordered the sounding of the ship's general alarm at 0305. On the Universe Explorer, fire doors with a spring-closure mechanism were at all entrances to passenger and crew cabins, offices, and service spaces; the junctions of all corridors with public spaces; and the intersections of the longitudinal crew corridors with the breaks on Aloha deck. During postaccident inspection of the vessel, Safety Board investigators found no soot evidence indicating that smoke entered the cabins from the ventilation system. Investigators observed pieces of twine attached to handrails near the door knobs for the two Aloha deck corridor doors leading forward from the break no. 1 passageway to the crew accommodations area where   15 the fatalities occurred.

Equipment--The Universe Explorer was certified as meeting applicable SOLAS requirements for firefighting equipment and lifesaving equipment. When not in use, passengers' lifejackets were stored under the beds in each stateroom  Certification and Inspection of Vessels--Certification of ships and their safety equipment is the responsibility of the government of the country in which the vessel is registered, known as the flag state. The governments of countries that are signatory to the SOLAS convention enact national regulations that conform to IMO requirements. Flag states can and do delegate vessel certification inspections to classification societies. Given the nature of the regulations, the number of countries signatory to SOLAS, and the number of different organizations that countries authorize to certify compliance with the regulations on their behalf, the interpretation of SOLAS requirements and, consequently, the determination of a vessel's compliance with safety standards, can vary. Therefore, countries have established their own regulatory interpretations and inspections to safeguard their ports and citizens. The Coast Guard, as the U.S. representative, has developed interpretations of SOLAS requirements and submitted them in official position papers to the IMO. These U.S. regulatory interpretations are consolidated into 12 the Coast Guard SOLAS Guidance Document, which is used as a reference by Coast Guard examiners to ensure consistency during inspections of foreign flag vessels. The following sections explain the surveys conducted by classification societies, particularly the ABS, which  Classification Society Surveys-- Classification societies, such as the ABS, are paid by vessel owners to survey their merchant ships. The ABS is a not-for-profit organization. The marine insurance industry relies on classification societies to establish and certify a vessel's compliance with hull strength and major engineering systems standards, which are contained in the societies' rules; many marine insurance policies include a provision requiring the insured vessel to be maintained in class with a classification society acceptable to the insurer. The classification society surveys the major elements of ship design and operation, including the materials used in construction, the size and distribution of structural members, and the vessel machinery for compliance with the society's rules. ""Classification"" with a society evidences compliance with those rules. One observer has characterized classification as evidencing ""the soundness of design for the service for which 13 the vessel is intended.""  Quality assurance standards--Since the 1970s, the role of the classification societies in ensuring marine safety has grown. Lord Donaldson's report notes that the demand for services resulted in an increase in the number of classification societies, some of which lacked the resources or expertise to fulfill all the duties expected of them. With the growth in the number of classification societies, some shipowners increasingly put economic pressures on certifying officials, threatening to deal with another society that might not interpret the classification standards as stringently. As a result, in 1994, the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), which com-  13  The latest version of the SOLAS Guidance Document is revision 1, dated September 1994.  12  Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas--Report of Lord Donaldson's inquiry into merchant shipping pollution prevention.

The ABS is a member of IACS. signed an ABS classification, and the vessel then enters into a periodic survey schedule. The changed cable to casualty ABS classification survey rules have over the years. The ABS surveys applithe Universe Explorer at the time of this were as follows:  The American Bureau of Shipping--The Universe Explorer was built to ABS classification requirements and classed by ABS upon its delivery in 1958. The vessel transferred to LR classification in September 1976 and transferred back to ABS classification in March 1984. The ABS has technical staff and surveyors stationed in principal U.S. ports and in many ports around the world. Its procedures for the various surveys required to maintain a vessel in class are published annually in its Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels. The ABS classification process typically begins when a ship owner submits an ABS Request for Classification Agreement. For a new ship being built to ABS class, the shipyard then submits plans and material specifications for the ABS to review. The ABS technical staff review the plans and specifications and complete calculations to ensure that the proposed ship will be built in accordance with ABS rules. After the plans and specifications have been approved, they are sent to an ABS field surveyor who travels to the shipyard where the ship will be built to oversee the construction to ensure that the ship is built in compliance with the approved plans and ABS rules. In rare cases, a person qualified in both the plan approval and survey processes may perform both the technical review and approval and the on-board verification. Surveyors visit the vessel throughout construction process, periodically checking ship for compliance. When construction completed, the vessel and its machinery are the the is as-  1. Annual Class Surveys--ABS Rules 1/3.1.3 stipulate that inspections of hull, machinery, automation, and cargo refrigeration are to be made within 3 months before or after each annual anniversary date of the crediting of the previous Special Periodical Survey or original construction date. 2. Special Periodical Surveys--ABS Rules 1/3.1.5 state that these examinations must be completed within 5 years after the date of build or after the previous Special Periodical Survey. Because these surveys include inspecting the scantlings, the ship must be placed in drydock for this type of survey. 3. Other Surveys--If an ABS-classed vessel sustains or is suspected to have sustained damage or undergoes modifications that may affect the vessel's classification, the master is responsible for notifying the ABS so that appropriate surveys may be performed. The ABS checks a vessel's internal arrangements against relevant vessel plans when the ship is taken into ABS classification or when ABS-approved modifications are being made to the vessel. The owner or master is obligated to advise ABS in advance of planned modifications so that necessary reviews, approvals, and surveys may be performed. During subsequent periodic inspections, ABS surveyors are not required to check the vessel's internal arrangements against approved plans to identify any modifications that may have been made without ABS knowledge or approval, although surveyors may identify such modifications in the course of such surveys.  14  IACS press release, May 1997. The merchant tonnage referred to is self-propelled, sea-going merchant ships of 100 gross tons or greater.   17 The ABS advised the Safety Board that when the vessel returned from LR to ABS class in 1984, ""Initial issuance of SOLAS certificates by ABS in 1985 was based on prior approvals by the previous certifiers,"" including the Coast Guard, the Netherlands Antilles, and the LR on behalf of Panama, and the ABS plan review of the ship as configured in 1985, and ABS survey. Between 1985 and the time of this fire, the ABS reviewed and approved a number of operational plans for and conducted a number of surveys of the Universe Explorer. A Damage Control Plan approved by the ABS in 1985 and a Lifesaving Plan approved by the ABS in 1990 each show the main laundry without the corridor bulkhead. In 1991, the ABS approved the Fire Control Plan that showed the corridor bulkhead in the main laundry. On May 24, 1995, the ABS, acting on behalf of Panama with respect to statutory certification, issued the Universe Explorer a Loadline Certificate, which was valid until January 31, 2000. The ABS conducted an annual loadline survey and issued a Passenger Ship Safety Certificate, which was valid for 1 year from date of issue, on behalf of the Panamanian Government on January 12, 1996, in New Orleans. According to the present Universe Explorer operator, the bulkhead in the main laundry was removed with ABS approval during a conversion completed in the early 1970s while the vessel was being operated by another company. However, the operator has not been able to provide the Safety Board with a copy of any classification society document approving the bulkhead removal. The ABS advised the Board that it has no evidence in its files that it was ""informed of, aware of, or approved"" the removal of the bulkhead. In correspondence with the Board, the ABS further stated, ""This bulkhead was not required to be in place for compliance with ABS classification requirements or the statutory requirements of the flag Administration, Panama, at the time of the casualty."" The ABS said that it based its argument on SOLAS 48, Chapter II, Regulation 33(a)(ii), ""Protection of Vertical Stairways,"" which states: Stairway enclosures shall have direct communication with the corridors and be of sufficient area to prevent congestion having in view the number of persons likely to use them in an emergency, and shall contain as little accommodation or other enclosed space in which a fire may originate as practicable.  Coast Guard Examinations--As a port state, the United States requires that any foreign cruise ship that is to embark passengers from U.S. ports must be examined by the Coast Guard for ""substantial compliance"" with the safety, construction, and equipment requirements in applicable conventions. Current Coast Guard procedures, contained in the agency's Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 1-93, effective January 21, 1993, provide guidance regarding necessary Coast Guard examinations for foreign cruise ships operators. Parts A, B, and C provide guidance on the initial CVE process, on annual CVEs, and on quarterly CVEs, respectively.  Initial CVE (Part A of NVIC 1-93)--The Coast Guard conducts a plan review and examinations of foreign vessels meeting one of the following criteria: 1. The vessel (new or existing) intends to embark passengers for the first time from a U.S. port;  2. The vessel has undergone a modification or alteration of a ""major character"" as defined by SOLAS 15 74; 3. The vessel returns to service more than 1 year after its annual Control Verification Certificate has expired  SOLAS 74, Chapter II-2, Part A, Regulation 1 defines a modification of a ""major character"" as being any change that substantially alters the dimensions of a ship, that substantially alters the passenger carrying capacity of a ship, or substantially increases a ship's service life.  15   18 and the vessel has not received a plan review by the Coast Guard's MSC within 5 years; or 4. The vessel is selected for such examination by the Commandant of the Coast Guard for some other reason. The plans submitted to the Coast Guard MSC for review must reflect the ""as fitted"" condition of the vessel and be approved by the flag state administration or a recognized organization acting on behalf of the flag administration. The submission must include a written summary explaining any special considerations, such as equivalencies or exemptions, approved by the flag administration. The fire control plans must show the location of all MVZ boundaries, the insulation value of bulkheads and decks, and the numerical fire risk designation for applicable areas as required by SOLAS. The MSC examines the plans for completeness and certification and adds the Coast Guard stamp and date of review. After the MSC has conducted the plan review, the ship owner must next arrange for Coast Guard inspectors to perform a verification examination of the vessel itself. Except for initial CVEs conducted while the vessel is still under construction, the Coast Guard will not examine the vessel unless it has been issued a SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate attesting compliance with all applicable international treaties by the flag administration or its agent. The Coast Guard circular advises owners and agents to allow up to 4 days in port for an initial CVE, depending upon the size of the vessel and the complexity of its systems. The primary focus of an initial CVE is on structural fire protection, fire protection systems, means of escape, lifesaving equipment, engineering systems, emergency fire and boat drills, and the resolution of plan review comments. Because the purpose of the examination is to verify ""substantial"" compliance, Coast Guard inspectors are  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19.

However, if they have reason to believe the vessel's safety equipment or material condition is substandard, they have the option of examining the vessel in greater detail. Upon successful completion of the initial examination, the Coast Guard issues a Control Verification Certificate that is valid for up to 1 year; it usually is dated to expire on the expiration date of the Passenger Ship Safety Certificate issued by the flag administration. As mentioned earlier, the Universe Explorer originally was a U.S. flag vessel whose construction was certified by the Coast Guard as complying both with SOLAS 48 requirements and U.S. standards. In 1972, it left U.S. registry and began operating as a foreign flag ship.   19 Between 1980 and 1985, the Coast Guard did not require that a foreign passenger ship applying to embark passengers from a U.S. port undergo a plan review as part of the initial CVE process. When the Volendam (now the Universe Explorer) applied for an initial CVE in 1983, the Coast Guard did not conduct a plan review as part of its examination. After adopting a revised NVIC in 1985 requiring a plan review for an initial CVE, the Coast Guard did not require that foreign passenger ships already operating from U.S. ports undergo an initial CVE with plan review. After the 1996 fire, the Coast Guard MSOJuneau commanding officer revoked the Universe Explorer's control verification certificate and required that the vessel undergo an initial CVE (with plan review) as a condition for certifying it to embark passengers from U.S. ports. The vessel proceeded to a shipyard in Vancouver, Canada, where repairs were completed. While the ship was in the Canadian shipyard, Coast Guard inspectors journeyed from the Seattle office to conduct the initial CVE. No record indicates that the company submitted any plans to the MSC for an initial CVE as specified by NVIC 1-93. Examination documentation states that Coast Guard inspectors referred to vessel plans while checking the structural fire protection features of the vessel; the source of the plans is not identified. Inspectors selected overhead panels for removal at random to spotcheck MVZ penetrations and penetrations of stair tower boundaries. They found areas where penetrations were not properly insulated to maintain the integrity of the fire boundaries; they required that these areas be corrected. Inspectors noted fire doors that did not operate properly; after being closed, the doors could not be easily opened by one person. Inspectors also noted that a new bulkhead separating the E deck main laundry from the stairways had been installed. Records indicate that the Coast Guard completed its initial CVE of the Universe Explorer on August 13, 1996. After all noted deficiencies were corrected, the Coast Guard inspectors issued the vessel a new control verification certificate and it resumed operations.  Annual CVE (Part B of NVIC 1-93)--In order to continue embarking passengers from U.S. ports, foreign flag vessels are required to renew their verification certificates annually. The NVIC 1-93 stipulates that the purpose of the annual CVE is to ""focus on the vessel's firefighting, lifesaving, and emergency systems."" It also states: The vessel should be checked to ensure no modifications have been made which would affect the vessel's structural fire protection, which have not been approved by the vessel's flag state, and reviewed by the MSC. The annual certification examination has 13 categories, most of which deal with random testing of systems and with observing the conduct of fire and boat drills. The first check in the examination process is a review of required documents and certificates. The NVIC 1-93 does not stipulate how detailed the review should be. Such detail is left to the inspector's discretion. The procedures dealing with the structural check of the vessel stipulate that the inspector conduct a walk-through of the vessel to ensure that ""no new additions have been made without approved plans"" and that stairways and escape routes are properly marked and free of blockage. Upon successful completion of an annual CVE, the Coast Guard issues a new control verification certificate that is good for up to 1 year. Before the accident, the Coast Guard last issued the Universe Explorer a control verification examination certificate on January 12, 1996.  Quarterly CVE (Part C of NVIC 1-93)--The stated purpose of the quarterly examination, is ""to ensure the vessel is operated in a safe manner."" The quarterly examination focuses on the training and knowledge of the ship's officers and crew in regard to the vessel's emergency procedures, firefighting procedures, and lifesaving systems. The   20 examination includes evaluating the crew's performance during drills and reviewing instructions and manuals for completeness. The extent of the vessel examination is ""at the discretion of the attending inspectors"" and is determined by the observed condition of the ship. Instructions for a general walk-through state that the inspectors should check the engine room, machinery spaces, and accommodation spaces. The NVIC 1-93 states that any modifications to the vessel since its last examination should be pointed out to inspectors. Upon completion of a quarterly CVE, the inspector records the date of the examination in the Coast Guard data base and on a Vessel Inspection Record maintained on board the vessel. Records indicate that before the fire, the last quarterly control verification examination of the Universe Explorer was performed in Seattle, Washington, on July 20, 1996. During this examination, Coast Guard inspectors witnessed a drill simulating a fire in the main laundry and determined that the drill procedures were satisfactory. The Universe Explorer subsequently underwent routine quarterly CVEs in December 1996, May 1997, and August 1997. Table 2 details the date, location of the Coast Guard office conducting the examination, and type of examination conducted on board this vessel from April 1987 to August 1997. in the Institute for Shipboard Education and as a cruise ship for passengers on pleasure excursions. V Ships, the vessel operator, states that it allows a transition period between school sessions and cruises for flag state or classification society surveys and needed repairs to be performed, crew changes to take place, new crewmembers to receive required training, and university staff and students to be indoctrinated about shipboard operations. The transition period length varies depending upon the itinerary of the ship. During transition periods, two or three shoreside management representatives typically are on hand to oversee operations. The V. Ships operations manager said that the Universe Explorer is required to maintain communications with shoreside management throughout its voyages. Vessel personnel must transmit via telex and fax daily reports of the vessel's position, speed, and weather. Further, they are required to immediately notify shoreside management of any particular problem on board the vessel. The operations manager stated that when the ship is on an extended voyage of 100 days, V. Ships requires vessel personnel to submit detailed monthly reports, which include such information as engine performance.  Waterway Information When the fire was discovered, the Universe Explorer had just entered the Lynn Canal, a deep fjord in southeast Alaska that provides a protected waterway inshore of the Chilkat Mountain Range. The canal extends in a roughly northwesterly direction for about 80 miles from Juneau to Skagway, Alaska. In 1996, 36 cruise ships carrying more than 425,000 passengers operated in the waterway.  Management Oversight--The V. Ships operations manager stated that shoreside management representatives regularly visit the Universe Explorer during the vessel's transition periods, at which time they have formal management review meetings with the ship's master and officers. Moreover, shoreside managers are actively involved in ship repairs and maintenance overhauls, and they attend classification society or flag state surveys and Coast Guard verification examinations of the vessel. Shoreside managers typically travel to and board the vessel during a voyage only if significant repairs have to be made or if a serious problem occurs on the ship while it is at sea. Shoreside managers do not routinely meet the ship at each port of call.  Operations General--As mentioned earlier, the Universe Explorer alternates between serving as a classroom facility for college students enrolled   21 Table 2--Coast Guard Control Verification Examinations of the Universe Explorer* Date August 12, 1997 May 12, 1997 December 23, 1996 August 13, 1996 July 20, 1996 May 14, 1996 January 12, 1996 March 18, 1995 December 17, 1994 October 8, 1994 April 9, 1994 January 17, 1994 August 7, 1993 May 1993 February 13, 1993 September 12, 1992 June 13, 1992 March 15, 1992 July 20, 1991 April 6, 1991 January 26, 1991 October 16, 1990 July 20, 1990 January 20, 1990 December 2, 1989 September 2, 1989 February 4, 1989 September 3, 1988 June 25, 1988 December 5, 1987 September 4, 1987 April 16, 1987 Coast Guard Office Seattle, Washington Seattle, Washington Miami, Florida Seattle, Washington Seattle, Washington Seattle, Washington New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New York, New York New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New York, New York New York, New York New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans, Louisiana New York, New York New Orleans, Louisiana New York, New York New York, New York New Orleans, Louisiana Providence, Rhode Island San Francisco, California Examination Type Quarterly Quarterly Quarterly Initial with no plan review Quarterly Quarterly Annual Quarterly Annual Quarterly Quarterly Annual Quarterly Quarterly Quarterly Quarterly ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **  * Source: U.S. Coast Guard MSIS Data Base ** Data does not indicate whether the examination was a quarterly or an annual.   22 V. Ships indicated that it has begun the process for gaining certification under the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which must be completed by July 1998 for passenger ships. Under the ISM Code, each company must develop a documented safety program that supports and encourages the development of a safety culture to ensure safety at sea, prevention of human injury or loss of life, and avoidance of damage to the environment and to property. Ships operated by companies that fail to comply with the ISM Code will be considered in violation of SOLAS and may be prevented from trading. The ISM Code requires each shipowner to establish a safety management system approved by maritime authorities and to receive a Document of Compliance for the shore-based organization and an individual Safety Management Certificate for each ship. Nonconformance with the ISM Code may result in revocation of these certificates.  FIRE ALARM SOUNDS ON BRIDGE. 1. 2. Immediately acknowledge the alarm. Send watch rating or Quartermaster on duty to the place the alarm comes from, equipped with a radio, flashlight, and master key. Check the fire pump is running; if not, start it from the emergency generator room. Upon arrival at the fire zone, the rating reports status of the fire. If possible, he tries to extinguish the fire and rescue any trapped persons. (When the fire groups arrive, the rating can return to the bridge.) As soon as a fire has been confirmed, the Watch Officer announces Mr. Skylight over the P.A., indicating where the fire groups must report. The Watch Officer checks that the fire screen doors are closed. The Master, Staff Captain, Safety Officer, Chief Engineer, Hotel Manager, engine control room, and the front desk are informed of the status of the fire. The Watch Officer takes out relevant safety plans. The Watch Officer directs the firefighting from the bridge until the fire chief (Staff Captain) takes over.  3. 4.  5.  6. 7.  Fire Response Procedures--The vessel operator provided the Safety Board with the written procedures that the watch officer is to follow in the event of a fire (figure 9). Fire Watch--SOLAS 74, Chapter II-2, Regulation 40 (6), states: For ships carrying more than 36 passengers, an efficient patrol system shall be maintained so that an outbreak of fire may be promptly detected. Each member of the fire patrol shall be trained to be familiar with the arrangements of the ship as well as the location and operation of any equipment he may be called upon to use. In accordance with SOLAS regulations, the Universe Explorer maintained a fire watch, which entailed a crewmember's making hourly rounds of the vessel to check 40 designated locations. Each station had a numbered key permanently attached to it by a chain. The watch carried a recording clock into which he inserted and turned the numbered key. Each key made a  8. 9.  10. When the Master arrives on the bridge, the Watch Officer gives a status report, and when the Command Group is assembled, goes to Mr. Skylight post. Figure 9--Required response procedures of the bridge watch.  unique impression on a paper disk from which the time of insertion could be determined. Each disk contained the fire watch record for 1 day; disks were kept on permanent file for the vessel safety officer to review to ensure that the fire watches were making their rounds correctly. The fire watch route typically began with station no. 1, which was on the navigation bridge, and proceeded in order of numbered stations from the Observation deck to the Sun deck, Upper deck, Main deck, Bali deck, Aloha   23 deck, E deck, and Hold deck, respectively. Upon inspecting the Hold deck, the watch returned to the bridge. Each tour started on the hour and typically took about 45 minutes. According to the vessel operator, the fire watch's duties (appendix B) included ensuring that fire screen doors were not blocked or lashed open. The fire watch usually took a staircase aft of the main laundry to descend from Aloha deck to E deck and then walked forward into the main laundry. After checking station no. 36 in the main laundry, he continued forward to the spiral staircase at frame 65 to descend to the Hold deck. After checking the station on the Hold deck, he reversed his route, which meant he walked through the laundry twice within a matter of minutes. Based upon the impression on the paper disk from his clock, the watchman was 16 last in the main laundry about 0229. determined to be directly involved in a serious marine incident."" The main laundry fire occurred when the area was not staffed. Moreover, the area was not locked and was accessible to everyone on the ship. When Safety Board investigators arrived at Juneau in the late evening of July 27, 1996, they found that the vessel operator had not arranged for any crewmember to be tested; investigators then asked the operator's representative to have several of the deck and engineering officers submit to routine testing. He agreed and made arrangements to have a technician travel to the scene from Ketchikan, Alaska. The technician arrived aboard the vessel on July 28, 1996, and collected specimens between the hours of 1340 and 1730 on July 28, 1996, from the following officers: master, staff captain, safety officer, senior second officer, junior second officer, third officer, chief engineer, staff chief engineer, and second engineer. The nine specimens were shipped that day to a Federally certified laboratory. Drugs test results were negative in each case. Because more than 34 hours had elapsed since the accident and because some personnel had been off-duty during that time, tests for alcohol were not conducted. During postmortem examinations on July 28, 1996, the State of Alaska Chief Medical Examiner obtained specimens from the five deceased crewmen, which were sent to the University of Utah's Center for Human Toxicology (CHT) for analysis. All test results for alcohol and illicit drugs were negative. Because the deceased were fire victims, the CHT conducted tests for two toxic combustion products, carbon monoxide (as measured by percentage of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood) and cyanide. All specimens had carboxyhemoglobin saturation levels generally considered to be lethal, from a 17 low of 64 percent to a high of 87 percent. Cyanide was not detected in any specimen.  Medical Findings Crewmembers and passengers who were deemed to require additional medical attention initially were transported to Bartlett Memorial Hospital. Four of these patients were taken by medical evacuation flight to either the Virginia Mason Medical Center or the Harbor View Medical Center in Seattle, Washington (table 3).  Fatalities--Records of the general postmortem examinations performed by the State of Alaska Medical Examiner in Juneau, Alaska, on July 28, 1996, indicate that all five men died from ""asphyxia due to smoke inhalation.""  Toxicological Testing--Regulatory requirements at 46 CFR Part 4 stipulate that the marine employer shall ensure that toxicological specimens are collected as soon as practical from an individual on board the vessel ""who is  16  The disk impression indicated the fire watch checked the main laundry at 0236. According to a representative for the manufacturer of the clock, it may have been 7 minutes fast, which would have made the time closer to 0229.

During its postaccident examination of the Universe Explorer, from July 28 through 30, 1996, the Safety Board found that the forward area of the laundry contained heavy charring and soot on the bulkheads and on the ceiling, including the overhead duct work, pipes, and electrical cables. Several overhead electrical cables were charred white and crumbled when touched. The insulation on two cables had holes exposing the copper wires. Small beads of copper were on the edges of the holes and the exposed wires. A dryer exhaust duct had warped upward. Investigators found small bits of charred plywood inside the duct. The 38-year-old vessel had been painted many times as part of routine maintenance. Much of the paint on the ceiling and bulkhead in the forward part of the laundry was burned off. On other areas of the bulkhead surface, thick pieces of crisp, charred paint had peeled away and were hanging down. The flakes of paint readily crumbled when touched. Some areas of the forward bulkhead surface had large areas on which the paint was intact or less damaged, as if protected by some object. During later interviews, the Safety Board determined that laundry bins had been against the bulkhead, but had been removed during fire extinguishing operations. The welding machine in the laundry area sustained extensive exterior heat damage, inclu-  ding the loss of the plastic cover on its control wheel and most of its surface paint. The insulation on a ground wire and on another cable wire had burned off, exposing the wires; however, the bare wires showed no indication of electrical arcing. A large electrical circuit breaker panel was scorched and covered with soot. The Safety Board found all panel switches in the ""off"" position and covered with soot. Heavy soot covered the surface of the forward bulkhead. The deck area with the heaviest char and ash was immediately starboard of the welding machine. The forward port corner of the laundry had a narrow-angle ""V"" 18 soot pattern extending upward from the area where the Safety Officer observed the fire.  Stairways and Aloha Deck--The aft stairway to the main laundry contained heavy soot on the stairway landings and bulkheads on the E deck level. The aft entrance also contained heavy soot on the bulkheads, deck, and ceiling. The enclosure bulkheads to the spiral stairway showed extensive heat and flame damage, with most of the paint burned off the bulkheads. In-  18  As a general rule, the wider the angle of a V pattern, the longer the burned material has been subjected to heating; however, the angle of a V pattern on a vertical surface is a result of the size of a fire, burning rate, ventilation, and the combustibility of the vertical surface. Tracing the soot lines of the V pattern from higher to lower levels generally leads to the area of origin for the fire. See National Fire Protection Association publication 921, Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigation, the Factory Mutual Engineering Corporation's Guide to Arson and Fire Investigation, and the National Fire Academy Training Manual for Fire/Arson Investigation.   25 vestigators found heavy soot on the inside jams of the door casing and on the edges of the door. The spiral staircase, railings, and inside surfaces of the enclosure bulkheads also contained heavy soot deposits. The electromagnetically controlled fire door opening on Aloha deck at the top of the spiral stairway had heavy soot on its edges and sides. The athwartships corridor area near the open fire door to the stairway had heavy soot and fire damage, including charred and peeling paint on ceiling panels. Two spring-activated fire doors leading from the athwartships corridor to the crew accommodations area had heavy soot on the edges and sides. Investigators found remnants of string or twine tied on the handrails adjacent to each door. The deck, ceiling, and bulkheads in the crew corridors had accumulated soot, the port corridor more so than the starboard corridor. The paint on the port corridor bulkhead near the fire door was burned off. Each member of the crew shall participate in a least one abandon ship drill and one fire drill every month. The drills of the crew shall take place within 24 hours of the ship leaving a port if more than 25 percent of the crew have not participated in abandon ship and fire drill on board that particular ship in the previous month. The Administration may accept other arrangements that are at least equivalent for those classes of ship for which this is impracticable.... Fire drills should be planned in such a way that due consideration is given to regular practice in the various emergencies that may occur depending on the type of ship and its cargo.  Emergency Information and Drills--In accordance with SOLAS, a station bill specifying the emergency stations, assignments, and lifeboat locations for each crewmember on board was posted in crew areas throughout the vessel. In addition to the crew's emergency assignments, the station bill described the whistle signal and alarm bells for different emergencies. Crewmembers were to report to their emergency stations whenever the code word ""Mr. Skylight"" was broadcast over the public address system. The company also provided each new crewmember with a booklet describing the emergency procedures. Placards providing directions and safety information were posted throughout the ship. Figure 10 shows the instructions on the placard that was in each passenger cabin. The placard also provided visual and written instructions for donning life jackets. The information provided to passengers contained no instructions about how to open and close the fire screen doors. Crewmembers indicated they participated in weekly emergency drills, which included reporting to fire stations and performing duties listed on the station bill, mustering crewmembers and passengers, and using firefighting and emergency equipment. A utility crewman stated that during previous drills, he and his  Survival Factors The first part of this section contains the standards and regulatory requirements related to emergency training and drills and the on-board provisions and procedures established by vessel or shoreside management. The second section contains a narrative account of the actual events on the morning of the accident, using crewmember statements from interviews and passenger statements from a survey that the Safety Board mailed to a sample of passen19 gers. The last section summarizes the response effort by the Coast Guard and local agencies.  Regulatory Requirements--The SOLAS regulation governing emergency training and drills for passenger and cargo ships requires that vessels conduct musters and drills; it states  19  In August 1996, the Safety Board mailed a questionnaire to a sample of 330 passengers. Of those, 283 responded.   26 don the life jackets stored in their cabins, and report to their assigned lifeboat stations. About 70 percent of the passengers responding to the Safety Board survey stated that the instructions given during the drill were of great value and prevented panic and chaos during the actual fire. About 65 percent of the passengers characterized the drill as very realistic. One passenger said that the emergency made her realize how important to her personal safety the drill had been. Thirty percent of the respondents said that the drill instructions were inadequate because they were disorganized and incomplete, lacking information such as how to operate the fire screen doors. About 25 percent of the responders described the drill as minimally realistic because many passengers who knew the scheduled time of the drill went in advance to their lifeboats, using the elevators to reach their stations. Several passengers characterized the drill as unrealistic because the crew had laid out the passengers' life jackets on their beds in preparation for the drill; whereas they had to hunt for their jackets, which were stowed under beds or in closets, during the actual emergency. Only 50 passengers responding recalled seeing a placard explaining what to do in the event of an actual fire. Most responders--219 passengers--said the oral instructions they received during the drill did not include information on what they should do if they saw a fire, smelled smoke, or had to open a fire screen door. One passenger said, ""We were never even told about the fire screen doors or that, in the case of a fire, the fire screen doors would close, and we might have our passage to the boat station blocked by them.""

Figure 10--Information on the placard in each passenger cabin.  roommate always had used the passageway toward the galley. They had never practiced using an alternate escape route. Crewmembers and passengers stated that they participated in an ""abandon ship"" drill before leaving Vancouver on July 23, 1996. The ship's master stated that passengers were advised what the signal would be for an emergency and that they were to don their life jackets and proceed to muster stations when they heard the alarm. He indicated that they were told how to follow the arrows in the passageways to locate their muster stations. Passengers were also told when the abandon ship drill would be conducted and instructed not to use elevators during an actual emergency.  General Response by Crew--The Vancouver Drill--Passengers stated that upon boarding the Universe Explorer, they received an announcement that a drill would be conducted to provide information about what to do in the event of an emergency. They said they were instructed to read the notice in their cabins, station bill for the Universe Explorer lists all crewmember positions and their respective assignments in the event of an emergency. The ship's hotel manager is responsible for coordinating the passenger evacuation effort. He was   27 not wearing or carrying a breathing apparatus when he attempted to go forward on the Main deck to begin a search of the cabins. Upon opening a door on the port side, he encountered ""a lot of black smoke"" that stung his eyes and made it difficult for him to breathe. He then went aft on the port side and was joined by other crewmembers. As the crew searched passenger staterooms, they put a towel on the knob of each exterior door to indicate that the cabin had been checked. They next wrapped towels around their faces to protect them from the smoke and proceeded to the Aloha deck to check the accommodations areas. They found a crewman overcome by smoke, put him on a stretcher, and carried him to the Promenade deck. of smoke or smelled smoke in the corridors; other passengers reported that they saw no smoke. Passengers who had cabins in the lower and forward sections of the ship reported that hallways were filled with ""thick, heavy, and very black"" smoke and that visibility was ""low"" or ""about 40 feet."" Respondents described the hallway lighting as adequate. Forty-eight passengers stated that during the emergency, they had difficulty moving to and opening fire screen doors. One handicapped passenger could not open the door by herself and had to be assisted by another passenger. One passenger said that he encountered another passenger who panicked when the fire screen door closed; together they read the instructions on the door and were able to open it. Several passengers on the Observation deck reported having problems with the fire screen doors. An elderly couple and a young couple said they could not open either the port or aft fire screen door for about 10 minutes. Another couple encountered two sets of closed fire doors and a man yelling, ""We're trapped and can't get out!"" The woman who was able to open the door recalled that because the handle was recessed, it was difficult to see how it worked. On the Bali deck, a passenger reported having trouble opening the fire doors because no instructions were on or near them. Another passenger said that when she encountered a closed fire door, she proceeded through a ""crew exit"" door and encountered a vessel firefighter, who directed her to the lifeboat station. Most survey respondents characterized the overall behavior of passengers as disciplined and civil and praised the crewmembers' diligent and professional concern for the passengers, describing them as very efficient, reassuring, helpful, and understanding. Muster leaders took roll and were able to account for all passengers but not all crewmembers. The master said that passengers remained calm and that after the fire was extinguished, they were allowed to return to their cabins to pack in preparation for leaving the vessel.  Passenger Notification--More than 270 passengers surveyed said they were in their cabins when they became aware of the fire. Some smelled smoke in their cabins; others saw smoke in the passageways when they opened their doors in response to the sounds of a commotion in the corridors, the ringing of the emergency alarm, or someone yelling ""fire."" Within minutes of being notified about the fire, the cruise director reported to the bridge, where he began making announcements over the public address system to keep passengers calm and to instruct them in reporting to their muster stations. Several survey respondents stated that they did not hear a public address announcement. Others reported hearing the cruise director announce that there was a fire and that passengers should report to their muster stations. Many of those passengers who recalled the announcement were already at their muster stations, while others were just leaving their cabins. One respondent said, ""There was no communication from the ship's captain or any officer of the crew until several passengers challenged an official from the cruise line to inform us of the situation, 4 to 5 hours after the initial fire."" More than half of the passengers reported that they saw a ""slight"" or ""moderate"" amount   28  Response by Hospital Staff--The medical staff on the Universe Explorer comprised a doctor and two nurses, whose cabins were located near the ship's hospital on the Bali deck. Because the hospital was located directly above the main laundry, it was subjected to high levels of heat during the fire. The doctor stated that because of the thick blue-black smoke, he could not reach any medical equipment; he was only able to ""grab"" the medical staff's one portable radio before going to his boat station on the Main deck. The vessel's medical staff assisted passengers and crew with smoke inhalation injuries in various locations throughout the ship. The doctor stated that because they only had one radio, the nurses had to report in person to him to determine where their assistance was most needed. The doctor was able to obtain one additional radio, which he gave to one of the nurses, to coordinate their response. The doctor said that he retrieved the extra medical kit that is maintained on the bridge, but found it of marginal use because it lacked the oxygen needed to treat smoke inhalation victims. Because the hospital was filled with smoke, the medical staff set up a triage area in the lounge on the Promenade deck. Three passengers with medical training--a firefighter and two nurses--assisted the ship's medical staff in attending to the passengers with heart problems and the crewmembers suffering from smoke inhalation. When Coast Guard personnel boarded the Universe Explorer about 0657, the medical officer and three emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from the Coast Guard cutter Woodrush provided oxygen for the smoke inhalation victims. The ship's doctor stated that he was able to obtain medical supplies from the hospital after the fire had been extinguished, about 5 or 6 hours after the initial alarm.  they were awakened by people shouting and knocking on cabins doors. One crewman said that when he heard a knock, he checked his watch and the time was shortly before 0300. All Aloha deck survivors indicated that passageways were filled with black smoke before the bridge made the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement or sounded the general alarm. An assistant cook said that he had already climbed up an escape hatch and was pausing to catch his breath on the Upper deck when he heard the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement. He estimated that about 5 or 6 minutes elapsed between the time he was awakened and the time he reached the open deck. A sanitation operator said that he had started to move aft through the port side passageway when he stumbled over someone lying on the deck. He said that he then heard the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement. A utility man stated that when he was awakened about 0300 and opened his cabin door, he panicked at the sight of the thick smoke. He and his roommate first tried to move toward the main galley, but the heat was too intense, so they turned around. They then became separated. The utility man said he was in the crew laundry when he heard ""Mr. Skylight"" and the general alarm. He then found a stairway to the upper decks. Rescue teams later found the roommate dead on the floor of a cabin, a victim of smoke inhalation. Another crewman said that he tried to follow other people, but the smoke was too thick to see them. He tried to walk aft toward the main galley; but because of the heat and smoke, he had to turn around and proceed forward. He said he stumbled around in the dark passageway and into the crew laundry and then heard the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement. He said he was trying to feel his way forward to an exit when he found a cabin in which five crewmembers were gathered near an open porthole taking turns breathing fresh air from it. He said as he was breathing out the porthole, he saw a Coast Guard vessel and tried to get its attention by waving a towel out the porthole. He estimated  Crew Escape--Safety Board investigators interviewed a who escaped from Al sites where fatalities interviewed said that number of crewmembers oha deck cabins near the occurred. All survivors they were asleep when   29 that about 3 hours passed before he heard people searching for survivors. He said that when he and the other five crewmembers heard searchers nearby, they began pounding on the bulkhead and yelling for help to get their attention, but no one immediately came to their aid. someone pounding on the bulkhead of the cabin next door. Upon checking the cabin next door, they found a trapped crewman who had opened a porthole to get air. The fire team leader said they then moved the CA-22 occupant, who showed no signs of life, to the cabin with the open porthole and began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); however, they could not revive him. Fire team members then carried the surviving crewman to the Main deck for medical treatment.  Rescue Efforts--In response to the general alarm, shipboard firefighters reported to the fire station at the forward part of the Boat deck. About 0320-0325, the staff captain instructed a member of fire team no. 1 to don equipment, which included a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective 20 gear, and search the crew berthing area on Aloha deck. He said that after descending to Aloha deck, he opened the fire door to the berthing area and encountered intense and blinding smoke. He saw three crewmembers lying in the passageway and heard people pounding on bulkheads and calling for help. He shined his flashlight down the passageway and yelled in the direction of the noise, but could see nothing but smoke. He went into the passageway to check the three crewmen lying on the deck; they showed no signs of life. He estimated that he returned to the Main deck about 03350340 and reported his findings to the staff captain, who told him to return to Aloha deck and bring back the fallen crewmen. The team member told the staff captain that he could not do it alone because of the smoke from the raging fire. The staff captain instructed a second crewmember to accompany the team member. The second crewman obtained an SCBA about 0350, and the two firefighters and the staff captain returned to Aloha deck to recover the three bodies in the corridor. The leader of fire team no. 1 said that he was informed about 0540 that a crewman was in cabin CA-22. He stated that when he and other rescuers checked the cabin, which was full of smoke, they found the crewman ""curled up in a fetal position under the sink."" They then heard  Response by Local Agencies-- Eight local, State, and Federal agencies from surrounding areas responded to the accident on board the Universe Explorer. They included the Coast Guard, the Capital City Fire and Rescue of Juneau, the Juneau Police Department, the Department of Public Safety for the State of Alaska, the Alaska State Troopers, the State Fire Marshal, the Coroner's Office for the State of Alaska, and the State Medical Examiner's Office. Their response actions are summarized below. Coast Guard--About 0300, while monitoring channel 16, the navigation watch on the Coast Guard cutter Sweetbrier overheard the Universe Explorer reporting the fire and the vessel location to the Coast Guard's 17th District command center Search and Rescue (SAR) Coordinator in Juneau. The Sweetbrier then notified the SAR Coordinator that it was en route to the Universe Explorer to assist. At the same time, the Liberian passenger ship Star Princess overheard the radio transmissions and proceeded en route to assist. About 0321, the SAR Coordinator notified the Juneau Coast Guard station to stand by until the SAR command center had received an update about the fire. At 0324, a Coast Guard 41-foot patrol boat (41328) departed Station Juneau for the scene. About 0341, the Universe Explorer master radioed the SAR Coordinator that vessel firefighters were unable to enter the laundry space and were directing fire hoses on the outside of the compartment to cool the bulkhead so they could enter the space. The SAR command center  20  A firefighter's outfit consists of protective clothing, boots, helmet, flashlight, axe, and an approved breathing apparatus, such as an SCBA.   30 arranged for a commercial tugboat and a Coast Guard helicopter to respond to the scene. The Sweetbrier arrived on scene about 0413; its commanding officer assumed responsibility as the on-scene commander. Patrol boat 41328 arrived on scene about 0437. The Coast Guard vessels then escorted the Universe Explorer to Auke Bay, where the Coast Guard cutter Woodrush relieved the Sweetbrier and took command of the on-scene response. At 0657, the medical officer and three emergency medical technicians from the Woodrush boarded the Universe Explorer to assess passenger and crew injuries. Coast Guard personnel then provided security for the Universe Explorer and transportation for passengers, crewmembers, firefighters, and equipment until about 1800. The CCF/R firefighters remained on board the Universe Explorer until late in the afternoon. While on board, they maintained a reflash watch, monitored the air quality in smoke-affected areas, and provided condition assessments to the Coast Guard and the ship's master. About 1645, the CCF/R firefighters departed the vessel and returned to shore.  Juneau Police Department--The CCF/R notified the Juneau Police Department of the fire at 0506, whereupon the department's operations commander reported to the incident command post at CCF/R-Glacier District, arriving about 0535. He and the incident commander discussed transporting the cruise ship's passengers to shoreside hotel accommodations and decided to bus passengers to Centennial Hall, a civic center in Juneau. Police officers provided security, controlled traffic, managed the shelter, and oversaw bussing until the last passenger left Centennial Hall at 1800.  Capital City Fire and Rescue--About 0500, the Capital City Fire and Rescue (CCF/R) fire chief was at home when he was notified of the Universe Explorer fire. He proceeded to the CCF/R-Glacier District, about 4 miles from Auke Bay, where he assumed the role of incident commander, established a command post, and implemented the local contingency plan. He had all local fire departments alert their personnel who had had shipboard firefighting training to assemble with their equipment at the CCF/RAuke Bay District, where they were briefed by a fire training specialist and formed into three teams based on their past experience. The incident commander ordered the fire teams to report to the Auke Bay Harbor parking lot, where, at 0845, they boarded a tugboat that transported them to the Universe Explorer. When they arrived on board, CCF/R fire team leaders met with the master, who told them that the fire was already extinguished and that the area was secured. The CCF/R firefighters proceeded to the laundry to examine the fire scene and to ensure that the fire was completely out. While checking for ""hot spots"" in the laundry, CCF/R firefighters found still-smoldering debris, which they extinguished. The CCF/R fire team leaders kept the incident commander informed of the activities onboard the ship via radio and cellular telephone.  Department of Public Safety--The Alaska Department of Public Safety dispatch center notified the State Troopers Office of a cruise ship fire about 0605 and the State Fire Marshal's office at 0720. Shortly after 0800, a state trooper and a fire marshal arrived at Auke Bay, where the Universe Explorer was anchored, and boarded the vessel to begin their investigation. A Coast Guard representative advised them that a marine chemist was scheduled to arrive from Seattle, Washington, about 1730 to certify that the air in fire areas was safe to breathe. Pending the chemist's arrival, the state trooper and fire marshal helped firefighters identify the deceased crewmen and prepare the bodies for transport to the Alaskan Park Mortuary for examination.  Hospital Response--Upon being advised of the number and scope of injuries, the staff of Bartlett Memorial Hospital in Juneau implemented the hospital disaster plan about 0745 and dispatched ambulances to Auke Bay. Five ambulances and three buses transported 69 patients from Auke Bay, about 9 miles from the   31 hospital. The first patient arrived at 0925 by ambulance, and the last patient arrived at 1210. Four of the more seriously injured casualties were evacuated by medical flight to Seattle.  Other Information Vessel Smoking Policy--According to the vessel operator, smoking on the Universe Explorer is restricted. The crew is allowed to smoke only in a designated area in the crew lounge. Cruise passengers are allowed to smoke in their own rooms, on the open deck, and in a designated smoking area in each of the two cocktail bars. The ship's officers enforce the crew smoking policy. Crewmembers accused of violating the vessel smoking rules are subject to fines or, depending upon the circumstances, such as repeated violations, discharge from service.  Contingency Plan--As required by the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Manual, the MSO had developed a Fire Contingency Plan for the Port of Juneau. At the time of the Universe Explorer fire, the medical and evacuation sections containing procedures for responding to a shipboard fire had not been developed. Local Coast Guard port officials stated that they had conducted numerous discussions with local emergency agencies about procedures to follow in the event of a shipboard fire. After this accident, Coast Guard personnel met with local responders several times to identify ways to improve their emergency response capability and to complete the unfinished sections of the plan. Participants discussed the need to update the Fire Contingency Plan annually, to purchase more cellular telephones, and to maintain a list of translators who could conduct crew interviews, if necessary. They also scheduled future meetings. Before the Universe Explorer accident, the 17th Coast Guard District had last held a disaster drill simulating a passenger vessel fire and grounding on March 19 and 20, 1996. The exercise, which was a table-top drill conducted at the Federal Building in Juneau, was divided into two phases, SAR and oil spill response. About 200 people participated, including personnel from the Coast Guard, the State of Alaska, local emergency response agencies, and six cruise lines. During a debriefing on March 21, an evaluation team critiqued the exercise and made several recommendations for improvement, one of which was that a working group consisting of representatives from all agencies with a medical role during a major marine incident establish a plan to deal with medical issues during an emergency. The evaluation team further recommended that ""this [medical] plan should be considered for incorporation in the Unified Plan.""  FBI Case--On August 1, 1996, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), under its authority to investigate crime on the high seas, began a preliminary arson/homicide investigation of the Universe Explorer fire. The Safety Board provided the FBI with samples of debris from the fire scene for laboratory analysis. The FBI laboratory tests found no presence of an ignitable liquid or other material that could be used as an accelerant. The FBI investigation did not find sufficient evidence on which to base a criminal prosecution, and on February 13, 1997, the agency released copies of its investigation records to the Safety Board to assist in the Board's investigative process. New Certification Requirements for Crews--The Standards for Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) 1995 Convention adopted amendments establishing new training and certification requirements for seafarers that went into effect on February 1, 21 1997. The STCW Convention requires that ship companies document the training and certification of crewmembers employed on their ships. Moreover, the amendments require that before being assigned to shipboard duties, all crewmembers who are new to a seagoing ship must receive familiarization training in personal survival techniques including identifying emergency escape routes and muster and embarka21  Chapter VI, Section A-VI/1.   32 tion stations, or receive sufficient information and instructions to be able to perform certain tasks depending on their job titles, such as advanced firefighting, medical care, and operating a survival craft or rescue boat. 158 people. The IMO's Maritime Safety Committee subsequently revised chapter II-2, ""Construction--Fire Protection, Fire Detection and Fire Extinction"" of the SOLAS Convention in May 1992. These amendments, which were to be phased in over a 16-year period beginning in October 1994, applied to both new and existing passenger vessels and addressed many safety recommendations issued by the Safety Board in 23 its accident reports and studies. The portion of the requirements applicable to existing vessels are the RFSAs. Among other safety measures, the RFSAs require that existing passenger ships have fixed automatic sprinkler systems, fixed automatic smoke detection systems, and lowlocation lighting systems by specified dates. Further, spaces containing combustibles, including accommodation areas and service spaces, such as laundries, are not permitted to have direct access to stairway enclosures. Appendix C contains some of the RFSAs applicable to existing passenger vessels such as the Universe Explorer.  Retroactive Fire Safety Amendments--Since at least 1980, the Safety Board has repeatedly identified such issues as equipment operations, personnel training, and fire safety deficiencies on existing cruise ships in its 22 major marine accident reports. In addition, the Board's 1989 Safety Study, Passenger Vessels Operating from U.S. Ports (NTSB/SS-89/01), called for additional fire safety improvements on cruise ships operating from U.S. ports. In 1990, the IMO's Subcommittee on Fire Protection was reviewing the need for additional fire protection requirements for new ships when, on April 12, the passenger ship Scandinavian Star suffered a fire that resulted in the deaths of  22  Fire Onboard the Italian Passenger Ship Angelina Lauro, Charlotte Amalie Harbor, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, March 30, 1979 (NTSB/MAR-80/16); Fire Onboard the Bahamian Passenger Vessel M/V Scandinavian Sea, Cape Canaveral, Florida, March 9, 1984 (NTSB/MAR-85/03); Fire Onboard the Bahamian Passenger Ship M/V Scandinavian Sun, Port of Miami, Miami, Florida, August 20, 1984 (NTSB/MAR-85/08); Fire and Explosions Onboard the Panamanian Passenger Ship Emerald Seas in the Atlantic Ocean near Little Stirrup Cay, Bahamas, July 30, 1986 (NTSB/MAR-87/04); and Fire Onboard the Bahamian Passenger Ship Scandinavian Star in the Gulf of Mexico, March 15, 1988 (NTSB/MAR89/04).  The Safety Board also outlined needed safety measures in its 1993 Special Investigation Report, Accidents Involving Foreign Passenger Ships Operating from U.S. Ports, 1990-1991 (NTSB/SIR-93/01), which contained information from prior Safety Board reports of the following cruise ship fires: Regent Star (DCA90MM037), Sovereign Of The Seas (DCA91MM023), Britanis (DCA92MM007), and Song of America (DCA92MM008).  23   ANALYSIS General This analysis is divided into three main sections. In the first part, the Safety Board identifies factors that can be readily eliminated as causal or contributory to the accident. In the second section, the Board provides a synopsis of the accident and considers where and how the fire may have started. In the final section, the Board discusses the following major safety issues, which were identified during this investigation:     Adequacy cations; of shipboard communideceased crewmembers. However, the Board has concerns about the conduct of postaccident toxicological testing, which will be addressed later in this report. The Safety Board therefore concludes that factors related to the vessel navigation system, propulsion system, and mechanical equipment neither caused nor contributed to the accident; that all officers were properly licensed and qualified to serve in their positions, and that no available evidence indicated that drugs or alcohol affected the performance of those officers and crewmembers tested.  Adequacy of fire prevention, detection, and control measures; Adequacy of emergency procedures; and Adequacy of oversight.  Accident Synopsis Available evidence indicates the fire in the main laundry originated near the spiral staircase, was fast burning, and generated a tremendous amount of smoke that was drawn into the spiral stairway and up to the decks above, where crew cabins were located. The system of electromagnetic fire doors was not wired so that local smoke or heat detectors would automatically close the fire doors in an affected area. The electromagnetic fire doors could only be closed universally from the bridge, which meant that they were not closed until personnel on the bridge became aware of the emergency. Some fire doors near crew areas were tied open, a safety hazard that was not corrected by the fire watchmen. Although the bridge watch initiated vessel fire response procedures immediately upon receiving the second alarm, a lethal amount of smoke probably had already spread through the open doors and filled the crew area on the Aloha deck. The smoke alarms in the area did not sound locally to alert sleeping crewmen to the emergency. Further, the crew cabins had no telephones or means by which crewmembers could either alert the bridge of the fire or that they were trapped by smoke or fire conditions. As a result of the crew berthing area's filling with smoke, 5 crewmembers died  The analysis also discusses toxicological testing criteria, the emergency response effort by Coast Guard, State, and local agencies, and the Coast Guard contingency plan.  Exclusions Neither the navigation or propulsion systems nor the personnel qualifications of the officers and crew had a bearing on the cause of the fire. The ship experienced no mechanical difficulties of any type during its voyage. From documents and statements, the Safety Board determined that all officers were properly licensed and certificated by the Panamanian government and were qualified to serve in their positions. Toxicological test results show that drugs did not affect the performance of the nine officers who were tested and that drugs and alcohol did not affect the performance of the five    and 55 crewmembers sustained minor or serious injuries from smoke inhalation. During its on-scene investigation, the Safety 24 Board determined that overhaul operations by shipboard and municipal firefighters and other factors adversely affected investigators' efforts to identify the exact cause of the fire. The following section discusses the Board's findings and conclusions about the area of origin, possible causes, and nature of the fire. area--the forward part of the main laundry-- rather than evenly distributed throughout the laundry. The narrow angle of the ""V""-pattern on the bulkheads in the forward area of the laundry also indicates a fast-burning fire. Further, the time that elapsed between the watch's checking the main laundry and the first heat detector fire alarm sounding on the bridge was at most 27 minutes, which does not support the scenario of a slow-developing fire.  The Fire Area of Origin--From examination of the fire damage and information provided by the vessel's crew, the Safety Board determined that the fire started next to the bulkhead in the forward portion of the main laundry, close to the doorway to the spiral stairway. A ""V""-shaped soot pattern was in this immediate area. Burn patterns on the forward bulkhead matched the outlines of laundry bins that had been next to the forward bulkhead before firefighters moved them. Further, the vessel's safety officer, who first witnessed the fire scene, stated that he observed most of the fire in this area. Two laundry bins, one of which was aluminum and one fiberglass, that had been closest to the welding machine were severely damaged in the blaze, indicating prolonged exposure to fire. Safety Board investigators found melted aluminum on the deck only in this area of the laundry, an indication that the hottest burning occurred there. Investigators also observed severe localized heat damage in the overhead and a heat-distorted dryer duct in the area. The Safety Board concludes that the fire on board the Universe Explorer originated in one of the laundry bins that had been against the forward bulkhead of the main laundry. Type of Fire--All available evidence suggests that the fire developed rapidly. Damage to the overhead was localized in one Overhaul is the process of moving and separating burned material to locate any hot or smoldering debris and to cool it or wet it down to prevent a reflash of the fire.   Cause of Fire--The Safety Board examined whether several conditions were present that could have resulted in the fire: discarded smoking material, electrical short circuit, contact of combustible material with a hot surface, spontaneous combustion, and a deliberate human act. Discarded cigarette--According to documentation from the National Fire Academy, for a discarded cigarette to ignite a furniture item or bedding, the smoking material must be insulated against air that normally dissipates the heat. If a lit cigarette becomes wrapped and thereby insulated within a layer of combustible material, such as linen, an open flame can develop within 20 minutes to a couple of hours. In addition, fire development can be accelerated if the insulating material is soiled with an ignitable substance, such as food grease, candle wax, or other substances that are frequently spilled on table linen. The Universe Explorer's operating company has a policy restricting smoking to selected areas of the ship, which does not include the main laundry. Moreover, the vessel hotel manager stated that all laundry workers were nonsmokers. The main laundry is neither a high traffic area when operations are shut down nor a desirable place to loiter or to grab a quick smoke. Between the time laundry operations were shut down for the day at 1800 and the heat detector actuated--about 9 hours--the fire watches observed no one smoking in the laundry and no evidence of smoke or fire. The Safety Board found no physical evidence, such as cigarette butts or cigarette packages, that indicated discarded smoking material caused the    fire. However, these materials could have been present at the time of the fire and dispersed or inadvertently removed from the laundry during fire extinguishing and overhaul operations. Despite the statements of the fire watch and the lack of physical evidence, a burning cigarette as the source of ignition cannot be discounted. The main laundry area was not locked or staffed after 1800. A waiter, another crewmember, or a fire watch could have been smoking in the laundry and carelessly disposed of a burning cigarette, which ended up in a pile of linen. Had it become insulated within the material, whether the linen was soiled or clean, the burning cigarette could have smoldered for a while without emitting observable amounts of smoke. Between the time the fire watch was last in the main laundry and the time of the first fire alarm (20 to 27 minutes), a burning cigarette could have ignited the linen, and the open flame could have grown into a fully developed fire. or equipment shorted out, causing enough heat to start a fire that spread to the linen stored in laundry bins and the paint on the bulkheads.  Hot air or surface--While examining the distorted dryer exhaust duct, investigators determined that access covers to the duct had been made of plywood that was burned away in the fire. The presence of small bits of charred wood inside the duct holes indicated that the plywood most likely was burned from the outside and that small pieces of the plywood were sucked into the duct by smoke-filled air drafting into and through the exhaust duct. Because the clothes dryers were off at the time of the fire, the Safety Board discounted the possibility that hot air from the dryers ignited the plywood access covers on the dryer exhaust duct. The Safety Board considered whether the fire may have occurred from linen coming in contact with hot operating machinery or steam pipes. The welding machine that was near the bins that burned had not been used for several days before the accident and, therefore, would not have presented a hot surface. The laundry machinery was shut off about 1800 on July 26, 1996, allowing more than sufficient time for the machinery to cool before the fire began almost 9 hours later. The steam presses were not near the fire's area of origin. Further, one of the steam presses was not used the day before the fire. No steam pipes were near where the fire originated. The Safety Board ignition sources, such ment, wiring arcing, surface or air, did not Universe Explorer. concludes that accidental as faulty electrical equipor contact with a hot cause the fire aboard the  Electrical short circuit--During postaccident examination of the overhead near the fire's area of origin, the Safety Board found an electrical cable with holes covered with beads of 25 copper, indicating the wires had been energized. Molten copper falling into a laundry bin could have ignited the linen. At the request of the Safety Board, the vessel's chief electrician traced the overhead cable and found that it powered the general alarm bell in the main laundry space. This wiring is energized by manual activation of the general alarm, which occurred only after the fire was discovered. The laundry manager stated that he shut off all laundry machinery at 1800 on the eve of the fire. The fire watch stated that no machinery was operating when he passed through the laundry shortly before the fire. During postaccident examination, investigators found the circuit breakers to electrical laundry equipment and the power control switch to the electric welding machine in the ""off"" position. The Safety Board found no indication that faulty electrical wiring   The melting point of copper is 1,981o F.  Spontaneous combustion--According to a senior investigator of hotel fires, spontaneous combustion fires are not uncommon in industrial laundry facilities. Today's detergents often contain an oxidant. The linen to be laundered often is soiled with organic substances, such as animal fat or grease, that may not completely wash out, leaving an organic residue. When a washed linen load of mostly organic material,    such as cotton or natural fiber, is dried and stacked, the heat absorbed by the material becomes concentrated and insulated. This can result in the organic residue reacting chemically with the oxidant, creating an increase in heat. When insulated with a natural fiber material, which has a thicker thread, the heat builds until the material gets hot enough to ignite. The oxidant then continues to feed the flame. Spontaneous combustion fires typically are slow to ignite. However, once ignited they can burn rapidly. The first heat detector activated on E deck at 0256:42. Within a minute (0257:32), smoke detectors were activating on Aloha deck. The fire watch had made hourly rounds of the ship, including the main laundry area, and detected no signs of smoke or fire. The Detex clock used to record the times at the fire stations reportedly was 7 minutes fast. However, even allowing for the time discrepancy, the watch probably passed the fire's point of origin three times within the 20 minutes before the first fire alarm sounded on the bridge. National Fire Academy documentation indicates that a free-burning fire can develop quickly from the spontaneous ignition of grease and other organic material that is well insulated by tightly packed cotton or natural fiber linen that has been washed and dried and placed into a laundry bin. The fire that erupted in the Universe Explorer main laundry originated in an uncovered solid-sided aluminum laundry bin. Although crewmembers stated that all material in the bins was soiled laundry to be washed, investigators could not verify this during the onscene investigation. However, the Safety Board doubts that shipboard staff would have mixed soiled linen with clean linen. Postaccident investigation could not verify whether washed and dried linen had been in the laundry bins; therefore, spontaneous combustion cannot be eliminated as a possible cause of the fire. insufficient evidence of criminal action. FBI laboratory tests of a fire debris sample showed no presence of an ignitable liquid or other material that could be used as an accelerant. Safety Board investigators also found no evidence that the fire was deliberately set. Nevertheless, conditions existed that were conducive to an undetected, deliberately set fire. The main laundry was located in an isolated area that was not locked or staffed after 1800. The time that elapsed between the fire watch last checking the laundry area and the heat detector actuating would have been sufficient for someone to start a fire. The laundry contained large quantities of readily combustible materials. Due to the flammability of most linen, no accelerant would have been needed to start a fire in the material. However, had the residue of an accelerant existed, it could have been destroyed during firefighting operations. The Safety Board concludes that neither discarded smoking material, spontaneous combustion, nor a deliberate act can be ruled out as possible causes of the Universe Explorer fire.  The Aftermath When audible alarms sounded on the fire alarm panel on the navigation bridge, the officer on watch initiated actions in accordance with company emergency procedures, dispatching the fire watch to investigate and telephoning the master, the staff captain, and the safety officer, who, in turn, began procedures for evacuating passengers and crew and for determining the location of the blaze. Fire teams reported to their muster stations in a timely manner, and, once a path to reach the fire was identified, quickly brought the blaze under control and extinguished it. Despite what might seem to have been timely alert and response actions, 5 crewmembers died, and 55 crewmembers sustained injuries from smoke inhalation. One passenger was injured, and another passenger with a preexisting medical condition required treatment.  Deliberate act--The Safety Board considered factors that may have led to someone deliberately setting the fire. The FBI conducted an arson investigation of this accident and found    The Safety Board examined factors contributing to the injuries and identified several safety issues in the areas of communications, fire detection and control measures, and emergency procedures that affected survivability.  Inadequate equipment--The Universe Explorer is typical of vessels whose steel structure results in ""dead spots"" where UHF radios become ineffective. In an emergency situation, it is absolutely essential that personnel who may be going into harm's way be able to receive and transmit messages. Had the fire watch, who was acting alone, been seriously injured or trapped and in need of assistance, he could not have notified the bridge. Additionally, had he had vital information about the progress of the smoke, the fire, the safety of the crew, or the safety of the passengers, he could not have transmitted it to the watch officer. The Safety Board concludes that the UHF radio alone did not provide the communications capability to ensure the safety of the fire watch, which, in turn, was needed to ensure the safety of passengers and crewmembers. The Safety Board is aware that the U.S. Navy has addressed the problem of effective internal shipboard radio communications by installing an internal radio antenna network throughout its vessels. This type of system eliminates blind spots, enabling crewmembers to carry out communications with no interruptions during an emergency. The Safety Board concludes that if the Universe Explorer had been equipped with an internal radio antenna network system, radio communications would have been more effective during the fire emergency. The Board believes that New Commodore, and its operating company, V Ships, should provide a reliable means of internal radio communications between the shipboard command and emergency responders and between the separate groups of emergency responders on board company-operated passenger ships. The Safety Board also believes that the Coast Guard should propose that the IMO require passenger ships to institute procedures, install upgraded equipment, or do both to ensure that reliable two-way internal radio communications may be maintained throughout a vessel during an emergency. In the interim, the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL)  Adequacy of Communications Ineffective communications affected every phase of this accident, including fire detection, crew escape, and medical treatment of casualties.  Contact Between Bridge and Fire Watch--When the second officer initially contacted the fire watch by UHF radio, the fire watch was on the open deck. He acknowledged the transmission, which the second officer heard, and started to descend to E deck to check in the main laundry. After the second alarm, the second officer again radioed the fire watch but heard no response, although the fire watch did receive and acknowledge the transmission. The second officer then transmitted in the blind, beginning his statement with ""If you can hear this, go ...."" When the fire watch heard the second officer transmit in this manner, he realized that his radio transmissions were ineffective from his location. He therefore tried to telephone the bridge watch officer when he, the fire watch, encountered heavy smoke on the Main deck. However, the telephone line was busy. The fire watch then started to run to the bridge to make his report, but, upon hearing the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement, instead went to his emergency station, never reporting his observations about the smoke conditions on the Main deck to the bridge watch officer. The communications between the bridge and the watch on the Universe Explorer represent a breakdown in two ways: the instrument used was ineffective in the environment, and the procedures followed did not result in the bridge receiving timely information about shipboard conditions. The adequacy of the company operating procedures for emergency response will be examined later in this analysis.    should advise its member companies of the circumstances of this accident, recommend that they examine their shipboard procedures and communications equipment, and, if necessary, make improvements to ensure that reliable twoway internal radio communications can be maintained throughout their passenger ships during an emergency. after the fire started. Had the stranded men had a means by which they could signal their location, rescuers could have determined that location and helped them sooner, thereby reducing the number and severity of injuries to the trapped crewmen and exposing the search teams to fewer risks. As a result of past investigations, the Safety Board has been a proponent of emergency call systems in passenger staterooms on cruise ships for several years. In a 1993 special investigation 26 report concerning passenger ship accidents, the Board made the following safety recommendation to the Coast Guard: M-93-39 Analyze the desirability and feasibility of equipping passenger staterooms with an emergency call system by which trapped passengers can signal their plight. On October 18, 1993, the Coast Guard responded that it was not convinced that incorporating an emergency call system into the existing telephone system would provide a significant benefit: The majority of passenger vessels have telephone systems in staterooms which passengers may use in the event of an emergency. The proposed call system would not improve passenger-to-crew communications, but would be redundant and require additional, unnecessary maintenance. Furthermore, during an emergency, passengers are required to go to an assigned muster station and crew members search all passenger staterooms. This procedure is an effective, reliable method to identify passengers that may be trapped in their staterooms. On February 10, 1994, the Safety Board wrote the Coast Guard, stating: ""The point of the For additional information, read Special Investigation Report--Accidents Involving Foreign Passenger Ships Operating from U.S. Ports 1990-1991 (NTSB/SIR-93/01).   Inadequate procedures--During this emergency, when the second officer received no response to his transmissions, he did not initiate measures to determine what had happened to the fire watch. For his part, the fire watch did not advise the bridge about his status or the conditions on the Main deck and left his fire patrol post without first communicating with and obtaining permission from the watch officer. The Safety Board concludes that the communication procedures between the bridge officer and the watchman during the emergency were inadequate. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore, its operating company, V. Ships, and the Universe Explorer master should review and improve communications procedures used during shipboard emergency responses, particularly the communication between the bridge watch and fire watch when the latter is sent to investigate a fire alarm.  Means of Communication in Crew Cabins--The crew berthing areas lacked telephones or other means of communication with which crewmembers could signal their locations or call for help. Crewmen tried to signal their need for assistance by waving a towel out of a porthole, by banging on walls, and by yelling for help; however, their efforts were ineffective. Because of the vessel's steel construction, noises either migrated or were not audible, making it difficult for rescuers to accurately determine where trapped crewmen were located. Had some stranded crewmen not found a room with a porthole through which they could take turns breathing fresh air, the number of fatalities would have been higher. Rescuers did not locate several trapped crewmen until about 0540, more than 2  hours    recommendation was not to require a redundant system, but to require a means whereby passengers trapped in their staterooms can summon help."" The Board advised that Safety Recommendation M-93-39 was classified Open--Unacceptable Response,"" pending the Coast Guard's reconsideration of its position. On August 6, 1996, the Coast Guard advised the Safety Board that it had discussed the desirability and feasibility of installing emergency call systems in passenger staterooms with the U.S. SOLAS Working Group on Fire Protection and, based upon that discussion, determined that ""an additional emergency call system would not improve passenger-to-crew communications and would require additional maintenance."" The letter further stated, ""Since the Coast Guard has completed the recommended analysis, we request that the status of the recommendation be changed to Closed, Acceptable Action."" On May 21, 1997, the Safety Board wrote that it was disappointed with the Coast Guard's actions, stating: The Safety Board disagrees with the Coast Guard position that telephones in staterooms will serve in an emergency situation, because telephone systems do not easily accommodate simultaneous multiple calls. If passengers are trapped in a stateroom and get a busy signal when they call for help, they may panic and could take inappropriate action. Because the Coast Guard has only discussed this recommendation with the SOLAS Working Group on Fire Protection and has not done any analysis as requested, Safety Recommendation M93-39 has been classified `Closed-- Unacceptable Action.' The Safety Board notes that the Universe Explorer had telephones in passenger staterooms. The Universe Explorer fire watch got a busy signal when he tried to contact the bridge by telephone. Had passengers been trapped and tried to use their telephones, they likely would have had similar difficulties. As this accident demonstrates, all accommodation areas should have a means by which individuals can signal their locations during a fire emergency to facilitate rescue operations. Even a simple system, such as the flight attendant call button system used on commercial airlines, would probably be sufficient to signal a location. The Safety Board concludes that the lack of a means to call for help delayed the rescue of trapped crewmen and contributed to the severity of their injuries. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore, and its operator, V. Ships, should equip the passenger and crew cabins on company cruise ships with an emergency call system so that trapped individuals can signal their location. The Safety Board also believes that the Coast Guard should recommend that the IMO require passenger ships to equip passenger and crew cabins with emergency call systems so that trapped individuals can signal their location. Further, the ICCL should propose that its member companies install emergency call systems in passenger and crew cabins.  Radios for Medical Staff--The doctor and two nurses had to treat passengers and crew located throughout the ship who were suffering from various injuries, some very serious. The Universe Explorer medical staff had only one radio, which meant that the nurses repeatedly had to go to the doctor to determine where their assistance was most needed. The doctor was able to obtain one additional radio, which he gave to one of the nurses, to coordinate their response, but the lack of effective communications interfered with their ability to render treatment to injured passengers and crewmembers. Had each member of the medical staff had a radio and a separate frequency on which to communicate so as not to interrupt other emergency transmissions, the doctor and nurses could have conferred over the radio without having to leave patients; as a result, more injury victims could have received better care by virtue of being treated sooner. The Safety Board    concludes that the inability of the shipboard medical staff to communicate by radio negatively affected the timeliness of the care provided to people injured in this accident. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore, and its operator, V. Ships, should provide each medical staff member on company passenger vessels with a portable radio for use in shipboard emergencies. In addition, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should propose to the IMO that passenger ship companies be required to equip each on-board medical staff member with a portable radio that has a dedicated radio frequency for use during emergencies. Further, the ICCL should propose that its member passenger ship operators provide each shipboard medical staff member with a radio and communications training for emergencies.  Bulkhead Removal--The vessel now known as the Universe Explorer was built in 1958 to SOLAS 48 requirements as interpreted by 46 CFR. The CFR states, ""Insofar as is reasonable and practicable, Types 1 and 2 stairways ... should not give direct access to accommodations or other enclosed spaces in which a fire may originate."" Original plans indicate a bulkhead that essentially creates a corridor isolating the laundry work area from the stairways (figure 6). Later plans, including the fire control plan on the ship at the time of the fire, also indicate the presence of the bulkhead. During postaccident examination of the laundry, Safety Board investigators observed that the bulkhead had been removed. The presence of the bulkhead itself would not necessarily have prevented a fire from starting; however, had the structure been in place, conditions would have been present that would have affected the timely detection of the fire and the propagation of smoke and heat. Had this bulkhead been in place and the corridor been maintained properly, no or few combustible items would have been in the walkway. Had the fire started in the laundry area, the bulkhead would have mitigated the effects of the fire. Even if the doors to the corridor and the stairways were open, the amount of smoke entering the stairways would have been less, resulting in proportionately less smoke migrating to the Aloha deck berthing area. The Safety Board concludes that removing the corridor bulkhead in the main laundry was an alteration to the vessel that seriously degraded the fire safety condition of the Universe Explorer. Further discussion of the bulkhead removal and the oversight by the owner, the flag state, and the Coast Guard appears later in this analysis.  Adequacy of Fire Prevention, Control, and Detection Measures The Safety Board determined that several measures affecting the fire safety of the vessel were either lacking, inadequate, or compromised. Any one of these factors could affect or contribute to the migration and propagation of smoke in the crew berthing area; together, they allowed a lethal amount of smoke to quickly accumulate in the crew quarters. This section discusses the following problems identified by the Safety Board:         Bulkhead removal; Effectiveness of fire detectors; Lack of a sprinkler system; Effectiveness of electromagnetic fire doors; Misuse of fire doors; and Lack of automatic local fire alarms.  Effectiveness of Fire Detectors-- When Safety Board investigators examined the main laundry after the fire, they noted that the smoke detectors were not connected to the fire detection system. The only active fire detection devices in the area were heat detectors. Records do not indicate why the smoke detectors were disconnected. However, from discussions with    people experienced in laundry operations, fire experts, and detector manufacturers, the Safety Board determined that moisture, dust, and lint in the air of a laundry facility can trigger smoke detector sensors, resulting in false alarms, unless the devices are properly maintained. Heatactuated detectors require more time than smoke detectors to actuate because a minimum level or minimum rate of heating must occur in the area of the device's sensor before the detector activates. The limitations of each type of detector could be reduced by establishing systems using both types of devices. Moreover, combining the system of detection with an automatic sprinkler system, which is discussed in the next section of this report, would provide a greater measure of safety by limiting the spread of fire. The Safety Board concludes that greater fire protection can be attained in laundry facilities by using a combination of different types of detection devices, as well as an automatic suppression system. The Safety Board is aware of other fire detection systems that are in development, including infrared and ultraviolet flame detectors and carbon monoxide detection systems. Some of these systems are currently available, and others are still being tested. Research at the National Fire Academy has shown that alarm verification and cross zoning of fire detectors are design features used in buildings to significantly reduce random false alarms. Alarm verification utilizes a time (15-30 seconds) to reset and verify a detector once it goes into alarm; if the activated detector does not reset, the alarm is processed as a valid alarm. Cross zoning is another self-verification feature using adjacent detectors on independent zones or circuits. In a cross-zoned system, if one fire detector activates and an adjacent detector does not, the probability is high that a false alarm has occurred. If both detectors activate, the probability that a false alarm has occurred is low, and the alarm is processed as a valid alarm. Any type of fire detection system can be designed to reduce false alarms by employing 27 either of these features. Given the high fire risk in laundry operations, improved methods of monitoring such areas are essential. Augmenting smoke and heat detectors with better surveillance measures, including installing video cameras in high-risk areas, may increase the level of safety aboard the Universe Explorer. The Safety Board concludes that improved surveillance of high-firerisk areas would enhance the fire safety condition on board the Universe Explorer. The Safety Board therefore believes that the New Commodore, and its operator, V. Ships, should review the adequacy of the fire detection systems presently protecting high-fire-risk areas, including laundries, on company passenger ships, and, based on that review, install improved detection systems or institute improved surveillance procedures to improve fire detection capability. Further, the Coast Guard should conduct research with the passenger ship industry and the National Fire Protection Association on the adequacy of heat and smoke detectors for use in high-fire-risk areas, including laundry spaces, and, based on the findings, propose to the IMO equipment or procedural guidelines for improving fire alarm reliability. In the interim, the ICCL should advise member companies of the possible need to improve surveillance measures for high-fire-risk areas on their ships.  Lack of a Sprinkler System At the time of this accident, the main laundry on the Universe Explorer was not equipped with, and was not required by SOLAS to have, an automatic fire sprinkler system. In this fire a tremendous, lethal amount of smoke was produced when the many layers of paint on the stairwell     W.

Prepared for U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, May 1980.     bulkheads ignited. If the main laundry had been equipped with automatic sprinklers, they probably would have activated and extinguished the fire during its early development, preventing or at least mitigating the spread of smoke into the spiral stairway. The Safety Board concludes that if the Universe Explorer had been equipped with an automatic sprinkler system, the large quantities of smoke and resulting loss of life may have been avoided. Had the doors leading from the main laundry to the stairways automatically closed when the fire started, the smoke and heat of the fire would probably have been contained within the main laundry long enough for the crew to have been warned of the fire and to have escaped from their cabins. The Safety Board concludes that had automatic closure of the fire doors been incorporated in the fire detection system, the fire doors in the area where the fire broke out would have shut immediately when nearby detectors activated, thereby restricting the spread of lethal amounts of smoke to the crew berthing areas on the Aloha deck. The Safety Board has identified the need for automatic closure of fire doors since the mid1980s, following its investigation of the August 20, 1984, fire on board the Bahamian passenger ship Scandinavian Sun while it was docked at the Port of Miami, Florida. At the time the fire erupted, the fire control system was in manual mode, rather than automatic mode, meaning that a person on the bridge had to activate the controls to shut down the ventilation system and to close the fire doors. When the detection system signaled the fire, the bridge was not staffed. By the time a staff officer arrived on the bridge and closed the fire doors, smoke from the fire had entered a stairwell and spread onto two decks where passengers were gathering to disembark. Of the 731 people on board, 1 passenger and 1 crewman died from smoke inhalation, 4 people suffered minor injuries, and 58 people needed treatment for smoke inhalation. As a result of its investigation of the Scandinavian Sun fire, the Safety Board concluded, in part, that the fire could have been isolated earlier had the fire control system, including the fire doors, activated automatically. Based on its findings, the Safety Board issued the following safety recommendations to the Coast Guard: M-85-60 Propose to the IMO an amendment to SOLAS 74 to require that heat or smoke detectors be made a part of each auto-  Effectiveness of Electromagnetic Fire Doors--The Universe Explorer had electromagnetic fire doors on all stairway enclosures and main vertical zone boundaries, including the forward bulkhead of the main laundry. These fire doors did not close automatically; they had to be released either by someone pushing a local switch or by someone on bridge remotely closing them. According to the laundry manager, the fire door leading to the spiral stairway forward of the main laundry was always kept open. The fire watch stated that the forward and aft fire doors of the main laundry were open when he passed through on his rounds and that no one had ever instructed him to close them. Soot on the doors, door jambs, and adjacent bulkheads indicate that the fire doors were open during the fire. Records indicate that on the morning of the accident, all fire doors, including the spiral stairwell access doors on E deck and Aloha deck, were closed within less than 10 minutes of the first fire alarm. Nevertheless, during postaccident examination of the vessel, Safety Board investigators found soot and debris patterns indicating that the fire doors, while open, had allowed the smoke and heat from the fire to enter the stairway, which then served as a flue, transmitting smoke and hot gases upward to other decks. The open fire door at the top of the spiral stairway on the Aloha deck allowed massive quantities of smoke to enter the break no. 1 passageway and migrate into the crew accommodation area forward of the break.    matic fire door release switch on passenger ships so that the door will close when the detector is activated. M-85-61 Propose to the IMO an amendment to SOLAS 74 to require that all passenger ships carrying more than 36 persons on international routes have an automatic manual fire control system in the pilothouse that integrates the fire detectors, the automatic fire door controls, the ventilation system controls, and the general alarm into a unified system. In response, the Coast Guard concurred with Safety Recommendation M-85-60, stating that such systems were currently available commercially for land-based installations. The Coast Guard further stated that while it concurred with the intent of Safety Recommendation M-85-61, such a system was not commercially available; however, ""The technical feasibility of such a system is well within the realm of available technology and has the potential for improving shipboard safety."" The Coast Guard said that it would present Safety Recommendations M-85-60 and -61 at the February 1986 meeting of the IMO Fire Protection Subcommittee for discussion. Based upon the Coast Guard response, the Board placed both recommendations in an ""Open--Acceptable Response"" status. The IMO subsequently took no action on the proposals. The Safety Board revisited the issue of improved fire protection measures in a 1989 safety study, Passenger Vessels Operating from U.S. Ports. In the study report, the Safety Board superseded Safety Recommendations M-85-60 and -61 with Safety Recommendations M-89124 and -125, asking the Coast Guard to propose that the IMO, in part, require passenger ships operating from U.S. ports and embarking U.S. passengers to have the following fire protection measures: M-89-124 A centralized automatic/manual fire control system on the navigation bridge that integrates the fire detector, automatic fire door controls, the ventilation systems controls, and general alarm into a unified system. M-89-125 Integrated heat and/or smoke detectors with automatic fire door release switches so that the doors will close automatically when the detectors are activated. In 1992, the IMO enacted amendments to the SOLAS 74 fire safety regulations that included improved measures for fire doors. Requirements contained in chapter II-2 stipulate that new passenger ships must have fire doors capable of remote and automatic release from a continuously staffed central control station, as well as from a position at both sides of each individual door. The release mechanism must be designed so that a door will automatically close should a disruption of the control system or central power supply occur. Further, Regulation 41-2 requires that the stairway enclosures, MVZ bulkheads, and galley boundaries on existing passenger vessels be fitted with self-closing fire doors capable of being released from a central control station and from each door. The Safety Board reviewed the amendments to SOLAS 74, considered the measure requiring remote release from a centrally manned location to be in compliance with the intent of the recommendations, and classified Safety Recommendations M-89-124 and -125 ""Closed--Acceptable Alternate Action."" Following its investigation of the fire on the Universe Explorer, the Board has reconsidered its opinion. As this accident demonstrates, having a central station initiate the closure of fire doors does not afford the maximum measure of safety and can result in delays that prove fatal. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore, and its operating company, V. Ships, should modify the fire con-    trol systems on company passenger vessels, integrating heat and/or smoke detectors with automatic fire door release switches. Further, the Coast Guard should propose to the IMO that passenger ships be required to integrate heat and/or smoke detectors with automatic fire door release switches so that the doors in the immediate area of the fire will close automatically when the detectors are activated. Also, the ICCL should recommend that member companies integrate heat and/or smoke detectors with automatic fire door release switches. One of the specific duties assigned to the fire watch was to ensure that all fire doors were not blocked or lashed open. Because some fire doors were lashed open during the fire, the fire watch's execution of assigned duties and the safety officer's oversight of the fire watch were obviously less than adequate. The Safety Board therefore concludes that improved oversight of the fire watch is needed to improve the level of fire safety on board the Universe Explorer. The Safety Board believes that the New Commodore, and its operating company, V. Ships, should institute procedures to improve the oversight of the fire watch on board company passenger ships.  Compromise of Fire Door Effectiveness--During postaccident examination, Safety Board investigators found evidence, including soot on the door jambs and remnants of string on the corridor handrails near the doors, that the fire doors opening into the berthing area corridors on Aloha deck had been tied open during the fire. Investigators noted that these doors were on a direct route between the crew cabins, a galley, and various job sites. The Board surmised that the crew had to open and close these doors repeatedly, which probably became at least an annoying chore and perhaps a difficult task if they were carrying items. By tying the doors open, they gained freer movement to and from commonly used areas. The soot markings and fire damage indicated that when the smoke and heat rose in the spiral stairway forward of the main laundry, it exited through the open stair door on Aloha deck into the break no. 1 area, from which it spread into the corridors of the crew accommodations area. The fire doors to the crew berthing corridors were the last barrier between the sleeping men and the deadly smoke. Had these fire doors been closed instead of tied open, they would have blocked the entry of smoke into the berthing area, and the crew could have escaped by alternate routes. The Safety Board concludes that the effectiveness of the fire doors to the crew corridors on Aloha deck was compromised by their being tied open, degrading crew safety and permitting lethal amounts of smoke to spread to the crew berthing areas.  Effectiveness of Alarms--When the heat detector in the main laundry detected the fire, it activated an alarm on a panel on the navigation bridge. No alarm automatically sounded in the area of the activated heat detector. When smoke from the fire traveled up the spiral stair and into the Aloha deck berthing area, it also triggered smoke detectors, setting off alarms on the bridge fire alarm panel. However, no smoke alarm automatically sounded on Aloha deck, where the crew was sleeping. To warn the sleeping crewmen on Aloha deck of the fire, the alarm had to be manually sounded from the bridge, or a manual push button alarm had to be activated from a location in break no. 1. The lack of an automatic alarm system in the crew berthing area delayed the notification and hindered the safe evacuation of crewmembers. Smoke had already entered and filled the Aloha deck berthing area before bridge personnel sounded the alarm. A number of surviving crewmen stated that they stumbled over crewmembers who had collapsed in the passageway before the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement was made. One crewman said that he had already escaped to an open deck and was pausing to breathe fresh air when he heard the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement. Had the crew been alerted earlier, they would have encountered less smoke and had less risk of being overcome by smoke during their escape.    The bridge watch officer, following company procedures, wanted to verify the existence of a fire before sounding the general alarm. He therefore dispatched the fire watch to verify the alarm panel indication and then called the master to the bridge. While these actions were taking place, no fire alarm was sounded in the crew berthing area. The general alarm was not sounded until the master arrived on the bridge and ordered it sounded. Crewmembers in the Aloha deck berthing area could not activate the manual alarm because it was located in the break no. 1 area, which was inaccessible because of high levels of heat and smoke. The Safety Board concludes that the lack of an automatic smoke alarm that sounded locally in the crew berthing area delayed prompt notification to the crew of the fire and the need to evacuate. Had the crewmembers who died received earlier warning, they may have escaped. Less than 9 months after this accident, the Safety Board investigated another fatal cruise ship fire in which the smoke from a minor blaze caused multiple injuries and death. On April 6, 1997, a fire broke out on board the Bahamian flag passenger ship, Vistafjord, which was underway from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to the Azores with 569 passengers and 422 crewmembers. The ship's crew was able to control and extinguish the fire; however, one crewman died as a result of smoke inhalation while trying to escape from the crew berthing area. Six other crewmembers and four passengers received smoke inhalation injuries during the fire. As a result of the Universe Explorer and Vistafjord accidents, the Safety Board issued the following urgent safety recommendations on April 24, 1997: To New Commodore Cruise Lines, Inc., and to Cunard Lines Ltd.: M-97-35 Without delay install automatic smoke alarms that sound locally in crew accommodation areas so that crews will receive immediate warning of the presence of smoke and will have the maximum available escape time during a fire. M-97-36 Without delay install automatic smoke alarms that sound locally in passenger accommodation areas so that passengers will receive immediate warning of the presence of smoke and will have the maximum available escape time during a fire. To the ICCL: M-97-37 Without delay advise members to install automatic smoke alarms that sound locally in crew accommodation areas so that crews will receive immediate warning of the presence of smoke and will have the maximum available escape time during a fire. M-97-38 Without delay advise members to install automatic smoke alarms that sound locally in passenger accommodation areas so that passengers will receive immediate warning of the presence of smoke and will have the maximum available escape time during a fire. To the Coast Guard: M-97-39 Propose that the IMO require all passenger vessels to have automatic smoke alarms that sound locally in the crew berthing areas so that crews will receive immediate warning of the presence of smoke and will have the maximum available escape time during a fire.    M-97-40 Propose that the IMO require all passenger vessels to have automatic smoke alarms that sound locally in the passenger accommodation areas so that passengers will receive immediate warning of the presence of smoke and will have the maximum available escape time during a fire. In May 1997, the ICCL wrote that it had distributed information related to the accidents and the resulting recommendations to its members for review and consideration. Further, the ICCL Technical Committee was including the recommendations for discussion on the agenda for its August 1997 meeting. New Commodore also responded in May, indicating it believed that the safety recommendations had merit and that its vessel manager would be discussing the recommended actions at the ICCL Technical Committee's meeting. The Safety Board therefore classified Safety Recommendations M-97-35 and -36 to New Commodore and M-97-37 and -38 to the ICCL ""Open-- Acceptable Response"" in June 1997. After the Safety Board sent a follow-up letter to the cruise line on December 17, 1997, Cunard responded on February 2, 1998, stating, We do not feel that your recommendations add substance to the international regulations imposed by IMO. On the contrary, we believe that smoke detectors sounding locally in crew and, much worse, in passenger areas risk panic in a disorganised evacuation ....We feel that hurried unilateral reactions to specific incidents might, in fact, damage rather than improve safety onboard. The Safety Board is disappointed by Cunard's position and has subsequently classified Safety Recommendation M-97-35 and -36 to the cruise line ""Closed--Unacceptable Response."" In a letter dated July 25, 1997, the Coast Guard Commandant stated: We concur with these recommendations. The IMO Sub-Committee on Fire Protection at its 36th Session discussed the possibility of requiring audible smoke alarms on passenger vessels during the development of the 1992 Fire Safety Amendments, but decided to require that all fire alarms panels be placed in a continuously manned control station instead. Concern had been expressed, by several member governments and the industry, that activated smoke detectors are frequently false alarms, and therefore the bridge should always investigate a smoke alarm first before any emergency alarms are sounded. However, this is exactly what happened aboard the Universe Explorer, and by the time the roving patrol arrived at the scene to investigate, several crew members had already been overcome by smoke. The Coast Guard will revisit the issue of requiring audible smoke alarms in the passenger and crew areas at a future meeting of the IMO Sub-Committee on Fire Protection. We will submit a paper on this issue to the next session of the IMO Maritime Safety Committee in May 1998, looking toward consideration of an appropriate fire safety amendment at the 453rd Session of the SubCommittee on Fire Protection in early 1999. In the meantime, we will work with industry through the SOLAS working group to develop the proposal and draft text. Our initial contacts with industry representatives after the Universe Explorer incident indicate some concerns with false alarms, passenger and crowd control, and panic with respect to locally sounding automatic smoke alarms. We will keep the Board informed of our progress on this issue.    In a September 11, 1997, letter to the Coast Guard, the Safety Board wrote that it was pleased with the actions taken and that, pending completion of the projects, Safety Recommendations M-97-39 and -40 were classified ""Open--Acceptable Response.""  Watch Officer's Initial Response-- In accordance with the operating   written procedures, the watch officer acknowledged the fire alarm when it sounded on the navigation bridge and sent the fire watch to the area of the activated alarm to investigate. The procedures further called for the watch officer to wait until after the fire watch confirmed the fire before closing the fire screen doors from the bridge. In this case, however, when the watch officer began to receive multiple fire alarms on the bridge, he did not wait for the fire watch to report back. He immediately called the master to the bridge but he did not immediately close the fire doors. The fire screen doors were not closed until 0305, after the master had arrived on the bridge and ordered them closed. The method of ship construction used in building the Universe Explorer is designed to confine a fire to its compartment of origin by use of structural fire boundaries. Fire screen doors are an important feature of these fire boundaries because they maintain the fire integrity when closed. In the Board's view, closing the fire doors ought to be the first action taken on a method I constructed ship when a fire alarm activates. To do otherwise allows more time for the heat and smoke of a fire to escape from its compartment of origin and to spread to other parts of the vessel. In this instance, the first alarm sounded at 0259, and the doors were not closed until 0305. During this 6-minute interval, smoke and heat from the fire in the main laundry continued to flow outward and upward through the laundry stairwells to other decks of the ship. If the fire screen doors had been immediately closed when the fire alarm was received, the amount of smoke that ultimately reached the Aloha deck crew berthing area may have been significantly reduced. The Safety Board concludes that the Universe Explorer's operating procedures that the watch officer is supposed to follow when a fire alarm activates are less than adequate to ensure the timely establishment of fire boundaries restricting the spread of heat and smoke. Consequently, the Safety Board believes that New Commodore and its operating company, V. Ships, should re-  Adequacy of Emergency Procedures Most passengers were asleep in their staterooms when the fire was discovered. The master ordered the emergency signal sounded on the ship's whistle and the general alarm system sounded within about 7 minutes of the first sensor alarm. Survey respondents generally had high praise for crewmembers' efforts to alert passengers and evacuate all staterooms. The cruise director arrived on the bridge shortly after the initial sensor alarm and began making announcements instructing the passengers to remain calm and to proceed to their muster stations. Meanwhile, crewmembers proceeded in an orderly and efficient manner from stateroom to stateroom, knocking on cabin doors to ensure that passengers were awake and to inform them to go immediately to their muster stations. Survey respondents described the crew as helpful and caring. The follow-up action of crewmembers to ensure each stateroom had been vacated was particularly noteworthy. After checking a stateroom, they closed the stateroom door and placed a towel around the exterior door knob to indicate to other crewmembers that the room had been checked and was empty. The Safety Board concludes that the crewmembers' implementation of evacuation procedures was effective in maintaining calm and order and in ensuring that passengers vacated their cabins and assembled at their muster stations. Despite the efficient actions of crewmembers in evacuating passengers, the Safety Board identified a number of deficiencies in onboard emergency procedures.    vise their passenger ship operating procedures to require that the navigation watch officer immediately close the fire screen doors upon receipt of a fire alarm. The content of the Universe Explorer drill left many passengers unprepared to meet the demands of the actual fire emergency. Allowing passengers to use elevators to reach their assembly stations during a drill does not prepare them to identify a safe route of escape. Further, not requiring passengers to observe approved safety procedures during drills may lead them to attempt the same shortcuts during the actual emergency, perhaps with tragic results. To be effective, a drill must provide passengers with the basic information, including:  Passenger Drill--The Universe Explorer conducted a passenger fire drill in a timely manner; that is, shortly after everyone had boarded the vessel in Vancouver. Because a fire can occur at any time, the sooner passengers are provided with emergency instructions and participate in a drill, the better. After the fire, most passengers surveyed indicated that they found the drill to have been very helpful. Based on the passengers' comments, the Safety Board identified several ways in which the drill could be improved. Some survey respondents stated that the drill consisted of providing them with instructions on how to don a life preserver and on how to locate their muster stations. A large majority of those responding indicated that passengers were not told what to do should they see a fire or smell smoke. Passengers were particularly critical of the lack of information provided about the fire doors. About one-fourth of the responders characterized the drill as unrealistic because many passengers who knew the scheduled time of the drill went in advance to their lifeboats, using the elevators to reach their stations. One passenger complained that the drill did not prepare him to locate his life preserver because it had been placed on his bunk for the drill, whereas it was stowed in his room when he needed it during the actual emergency. To have the maximum effectiveness, fire drills should be as realistic as possible. When dealing with a large group--in this case, 732 passengers--undoubtedly some individuals will become agitated or frightened during an actual emergency. When events occur for which passengers are not prepared, such as magnetic doors suddenly slamming shut, the likelihood increases that they will panic. Such reactions clearly support the need for passenger fire drills and for placards in staterooms that contain adequate instructions about fire emergencies.     how to report a fire; what to expect if a fire occurs, such as typical announcements, actions of the crew, operation of the emergency lights, and operation of fire doors; the location and meaning of emergency signs; the description of emergency signals; if incapacitated, assistance; and how to call for       the route to take from their stateroom to their assembly area.  As this accident demonstrated, information about remotely operated fire doors is particularly important during a drill because the sudden closing of these doors may lead uninformed passengers to conclude erroneously that escape avenues are blocked and that they are trapped. Passengers need to be advised that the doors will close in the event of a fire, to be informed that the heavy doors are not locked, and to be shown how to open a closed magnetic door. The Safety Board concludes that although the passenger fire drill held on the Universe Explorer was conducted in a timely manner, the content of the exercise did not fully prepare many passengers to meet the demands of an actual fire emergency. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore and its operating company, V. Ships, should revise the required content of passenger fire drills to include infor-    mation about what to expect in the event of a fire, with particular emphasis on the operation of fire doors. The Safety Board also believes that the ICCL should advise its member companies to review and, if necessary, revise their passenger fire drill procedures to ensure that they include information about what to expect in the event of a fire, with particular emphasis on the operation of fire doors.  Crew Drills--The Universe Explorer conducted weekly shipboard emergency drills as required by SOLAS. The drills did not include, and were not required to include, identifying alternate escape routes from cabins and work sites. The Aloha deck berthing area where the fatalities occurred is forward of the crew galley and most work areas; therefore, crewmembers routinely walked aft every day to eat meals and report to work. When alerted to the fire, they reacted according to habit in attempting to escape. Survivors from Aloha deck said they first tried to walk aft in the port corridor but could not continue because the intensity of the heat and smoke increased as they neared break no. 1, forcing them to turn around to find alternative escape routes. They said the heavy smoke stung their eyes and severely limited their visibility, requiring that they feel their way along the corridors until they found an exit. Although the crew had several other means of escape 50 to 60 feet away, locating an exit quickly was difficult. The position of the three deceased crewmen's bodies in the passageways indicates that they probably were overcome by the heavy, toxic smoke while trying to find an escape route. The Safety Board identified a similar situation during its investigation of the October 8, 1994, engineroom fire on board the Liberian 28 tankship Seal Island. In that accident, a spray of lubricating oil was ignited and immediately erupted into a large blaze, generating a tremendous amount of thick smoke that completely obscured visibility. Of the nine crewmembers in the engineroom, three died and six were seriously injured. Several of the casualties resulted from the crewmen becoming disoriented in the smoke and not being able to immediately locate an exit. Two of the crewmembers who escaped attributed their survival to special training that familiarized them with alternative emergency exit routes on the tankship.  For additional information, read Marine Accident Report Engineroom Fire on Board the Liberian Tankship Seal Island While Moored At the Amerada Hess Oil Terminal In St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, October 8, 1994 (NTSB/MAR-95/04).  Status Announcements--Passengers indicated that although announcements were made over the public address system asking them to remain calm while they were at their muster stations, they were not adequately informed about the progress of the situation. They said they were never told how long they might have to remain at the assembly areas. Further, they felt that someone in authority, such as the master or another officer, should have given them status updates. One passenger stated, ""There was no communication from the ship's captain or any officer of the crew until several passengers challenged an official from the cruise line to inform us of the situation, 4 to 5 hours after the initial fire."" During an emergency, it is vital to passengers' peace of mind to receive periodic information about the status of the situation, particularly any progress in overcoming a threat to safety. Further, receiving such reports from a recognized authority figure, such as the ship's master, is more reassuring. Understandably, the master's and officers' primary concern was to extinguish the fire. Nonetheless, providing periodic assurances to passengers during prolonged emergencies is important so that order and discipline can be maintained. The Safety Board concludes that the Universe Explorer crew did not adequately address passenger concerns about the fire and the seriousness of the situation while they were assembled at their muster stations. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore, and its operating company, V. Ships, should revise company procedures regarding muster assemblies to improve periodic announcements made to passengers about the status of an ongoing shipboard emergency.    The 1995 amendments to the STCW Convention that became effective February 1, 1997, recognize the need for improved survival training. The amendments require that before crewmembers who are new to a seagoing ship are assigned to shipboard duties, they must receive familiarization training in personal survival techniques or receive sufficient information to be able to perform certain tasks, including identifying emergency escape routes and muster and embarkation stations. As the Universe Explorer fire and other accidents demonstrate, knowledge of alternate escape routes is critical to the survival of crewmen during a fire emergency. While the Safety Board is pleased with the IMO's initiative to improve survivability training for new seafarers, it is concerned that comparable instruction and refresher training is not available for all crewmembers. The Safety Board recognizes the impracticality of requiring today's passenger ships to drill their entire crews weekly on identifying and using alternate escape routes from work and berthing areas. Nevertheless, crewmembers need more than a one-time training session in survivability, especially if, as new employees, they receive such instruction while having to familiarize themselves with other vessel operations. The Safety Board concludes that some of the deceased crewmembers on the Universe Explorer may not have survived the fire because they lacked sufficient knowledge of alternate escape routes from their berthing area. While the 1995 amendments to the STCW Convention will ensure that new seafarers are familiar with escape routes on vessels at the time they first come on board, these requirements do not provide a mechanism for periodic reinforcement of the initial training. Without periodic reinforcement of the training through further instruction or drills, the value of the initial training will degrade over time. The Safety Board therefore believes New Commodore, and its operating company, V. Ships, should provide periodic instruction or drills to all crewmembers on company passenger vessels to reinforce the familiarization training required of new seafarers by the 1995 amendments to the STCW Convention. Moreover, the ICCL should recommend that its member companies conduct such reinforcement training for crews as described. Lastly, the Coast Guard should propose to the IMO that vessel owners and operators be required to conduct periodic reinforcement training and/or drills in survivability to ensure that the crewmembers are familiar with infrequently used alternate avenues of escape. Conduct of the training could be facilitated by designating fire wardens for each berthing area who would be responsible for providing periodic survivability training, including routes of escape, to each individual assigned to the area.  Fire and Rescue Search--Following the ""Mr. Skylight"" announcement, the ship's two fire teams assembled, donned protective gear, and marshaled firefighting equipment. The safety officer took charge of the search for the fire while the staff captain directed the search of the crew berthing area. Despite the prompt action, the searches did not result in timely location of either the fire or the trapped men.  Fire search--After donning an SCBA, the safety officer began searching alone for avenues of approach to the fire, leaving the fire teams standing by. He first tried to proceed forward on Aloha deck along the portside passageway, but when he opened the portside door at break no. 1, the smoke and the heat prevented him from continuing. He returned to Main deck and instructed the fire team leader to accompany him. Together, they went back to Aloha deck and tried the starboard side door to break no.1 and were driven back by the smoke and the heat. They then went down to Bali deck and went forward until they reached a stairway to Aloha deck. When they ascended to Aloha deck, they found trapped crewmen, whom they directed to safety. They then received a radio call from the bridge to go to the crew galley. They next descended a stairway aft of the galley to E deck and proceeded forward on E deck until they entered the crew laundry and saw the fire.    The safety officer's attempt to locate the fire alone was ill-advised. Had he run into difficulty while searching for the fire, he had no backup with him who could have either aided him or obtained additional help. Although he was carrying a portable UHF radio with which he could have summoned help, the radio's capability to transmit from different parts of the ship was suspect, as the breakdown in communications between the second officer and the fire watch demonstrated. After finding his initial route to the fire location blocked by heat and smoke, the safety officer wisely returned to the Main deck and had the fire team leader accompany him on subsequent attempts to locate the fire. The two men continued using a trial-anderror method to locate the fire. On this ship, even the most stoutly constructed fire boundary is designed to prevent the passage of heat and smoke for only 60 minutes; therefore, timely location of a fire is paramount. Although ultimately successful, the men did not find the fire for 30 to 45 minutes. During this time, the fire continued to burn freely, producing increasing amounts of toxic smoke. Given his knowledge of the ship's layout, the safety officer could have organized a more methodical approach to locating the fire by assigning one or more search teams to check out possible avenues simultaneously. The Safety Board concludes that using this approach, the officers might have located the fire sooner. The Safety Board has investigated a number of passenger ship fires in which the on-board firefighters' speed in locating the source of the fire was an issue. The most recent case involved an August 19, 1994, fire on board the Regal Empress, which was carrying 1,394 passengers and crewmembers and was en route from Canada to New York, New York. About 0630, a crewman discovered light smoke coming from a cleaning gear room. The safety officer tried to find the source of the fire himself but was unsuccessful. About 0707, the master activated the ship's firefighting teams and initiated measures to isolate the fire. By the time the ship docked more than a hour later, the vessel fire teams still had not found the fire. The fire was not located and extinguished until 0953, after Fire Department of New York personnel had boarded the vessel and joined the search. The ""small"" fire ultimately resulted in almost $250,000 damage because of the protracted time required to identify the seat of the fire. Had the smoke and fire conditions in the Universe Explorer accident been different, speed in locating the fire could have had far greater importance. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore, and its operating company, V. Ships, should institute improved procedures for locating fires to improve survivability aboard their vessels.  Rescue efforts--The staff captain directed one fire team member to don breathing equipment and search the crew berthing area on Aloha deck. Upon opening the fire screen door to the berthing area, he encountered intense and blinding smoke. He saw three fallen crewmembers who showed no signs of life and heard people pounding on bulkheads and calling for help. He yelled out to the trapped people and shined his flashlight down the corridor, but saw nothing but smoke. He estimated that he returned to the Main deck between 0335 and 0340 to brief the staff captain, who told him to go back and recover the fallen crewmen. The team member told the staff captain that he could not do it alone because of the smoke and nearby fire. Shortly after 0350, the staff captain, the first searcher, and a second fire team member together went down to the Aloha deck and removed the fallen crewmen. No one rescued the crewmen who were trapped in cabins until about 0540. As noted in previous sections of this report, having a lone individual--in this case the fire team member--search an area of a vessel during a fire was ill-advised and dangerous. The searcher could have needed help himself or could have encountered people who needed assistance that was beyond the ability of one person to provide. Despite reports as early as 0335 that crewmen were yelling and pounding     on bulkheads, no organized, systematic search of crew cabins on Aloha deck took place then or after the bodies of the fallen men had been retrieved. The crewmembers remained trapped for 2  more hours. Fortunately, some crewmen had access to an open porthole from which they were able to breathe fresh air. During their period of entrapment, the men frantically but unsuccessfully tried to signal nearby vessels for help by waving towels out the porthole. The Safety Board concludes that efforts to locate and rescue trapped crewmembers were not initiated in a timely manner. The delayed search of Aloha deck crew cabins prolonged the trapped crewmen's exposure to smoke and contributed to the severity of their injuries. The delay and lack of systematic effort in rescuing trapped crewmembers demonstrates that the Universe Explorer crew was not adequately prepared to conduct rescue operations. The Safety Board concludes that if the Universe Explorer had had a properly equipped rescue team that was trained in locating and recovering people trapped in smoke-filled areas, the crewmen probably would have been rescued sooner and would have sustained less severe injuries; moreover, fewer crewmen may have died. The Safety Board believes that New Commodore and its operating company, V. Ships, should establish for each company vessel a team dedicated to locating trapped crewmembers or passengers and provide the team with recurrent search and rescue training. The 38-year-old Universe Explorer is a small vessel by current industry standards. Larger passenger vessels typically carry hundreds of crewmen and thousands of passengers. With so many people on board, the probability is relatively high that some passengers or crewmembers will become trapped during a fire emergency. Without properly trained and equipped search and rescue teams, such trapped persons may well become fatalities. The Safety Board considers dedicated rescue teams necessary on all passenger ships. The Safety Board therefore believes that the ICCL should encourage its member companies to establish specially trained and equipped shipboard rescue teams. Further, the Coast Guard should propose to the IMO that specially trained and suitably equipped rescue teams be required on board all passenger ships. Members of such teams should be provided with specialized equipment, such as SCBAs, radios, lifelines, and so forth, and be properly trained in its use. They also should be required to become familiar with all areas of the ship so that they can conduct a safe rescue in any section. Further, the training should include drills simulating rescues in smoke-filled areas.  Availability of Medical Supplies-- The fire occurred below the hospital, forcing the ship's doctor and nurses to evacuate immediately. Fire conditions prevented anyone from accessing the medical supplies stored in the hospital. The bridge maintained an emergency medical kit, but it did not contain oxygen to treat the crewmembers who sustained smoke inhalation injuries. The Safety Board concludes that the lack of a secondary supply of oxygen limited the medical staff's ability to treat the injured. Although inadequate medical supplies did not cause or contribute to loss of life in this accident, insufficient medical stocks could have determined whether an injured person lived or died had the casualties been more severe. The Safety Board believes that the New Commodore and its operating company, V. Ships, should ensure that all emergency medical kits on company passenger ships contain adequate medical supplies to handle emergency conditions, such as those experienced during the Universe Explorer fire. Further, the ICCL should, in consultation with member passenger ship operators, determine the amount and type of medical supplies needed during an emergency and recommend that such supplies be maintained in suitable locations outside the ship's hospital in the event it becomes inaccessible.     Adequacy of Oversight Earlier in this analysis, the Safety Board discussed how the removal of the corridor bulkhead in the main laundry seriously degraded the fire safety condition of the Universe Explorer. In the course of determining when and who might have authorized the removal of a bulkhead that was required by U.S. standards and SOLAS regulations as part of the ship's original method I construction design, the Safety Board identified problems in oversight, not only by the owner and operating company, but also the ABS and the Coast Guard, who were responsible for certifying the safety of the vessel.  Months before Azure Investments purchased the ship, company representatives discussed its compliance with the RFSAs with Coast Guard officials. Coast Guard files contain a record of a March 29, 1995, telephone call from the prospective owner's agent indicating the vessel would comply with the RFSAs. In April 1995, the prospective owner's representatives met with senior Coast Guard officials and ""knowledgeable inspectors"" to discuss possibly reflagging the vessel under U.S. flag. Toward that effort, they asked that the Coast Guard provide them with a copy of the agency's entire file on the Universe Explorer. The Coast Guard also provided copies of its examination findings of a 1989 fire on board the vessel's sister ship; the findings indicated that, contrary to method I construction standards, both ships had combustible insulation material, some of which could not be removed. In May 1995, the prospective owner had various marine technical specialists, including marine engineers and naval architects, perform extensive onboard inspections of the Universe Explorer to determine its condition. About the same time, the vessel's operating company contracted with a consulting company whose principals included former Coast Guard technical staff members for the project of bringing the ship into compliance with the RFSAs. One RFSA that was scheduled to become effective in October 1997 prohibited any space containing combustibles from opening directly into a stairway. A thorough examination of the vessel by expert consultants would have included the main laundry and, therefore should have identified that the laundry layout was not in accordance with the fire control plan. The Universe Explorer remained out of service between July 1995 and January 1996, while company officials had it modified for operating under charter to the Institute for Shipboard Education. Thus, the company had ample time, documentation, and technical expertise with which to identify and correct unsafe conditions, including either replacing the bulkhead or correcting the fire control plan.  Company Oversight--Copies of original construction plans, 1964 plans, and the 1991 vessel fire control plan, which were approved by the ABS, all indicate a corridor bulkhead in the main laundry. According to the present owner, the bulkhead was removed by a previous owner in the 1970s; after discussing the missing bulkhead with Safety Board staff, the owner's agent wrote the Board that the bulkhead was not ""pivotal"" in the case in that it was ""not required by flag, class, or IMO rules."" In another letter, the ship's operator stated, ""This vessel has been repeatedly and routinely inspected by its owners, flag state, ABS, USCG and other port states, and found in regulatory compliance regarding structural fire protection ...."" The Safety Board finds this argument distressing. SOLAS requirements at regulation 20 stipulate that general arrangement plans indicating bulkhead divisions are to be permanently exhibited for the guidance of the ship's officers and that the plans should be kept up to date with any alterations being recorded thereon as soon as practicable. Having an inaccurate fire control plan compromises the ability of officers to direct operations during a fire emergency, which, in turn, places crewmembers and passengers at risk. Given the time and opportunity that the present owner had to either reinstall the bulkhead or correct the fire plans, the Safety Board questions the company's commitment to maximizing fire safety.    The 7-month period that the vessel was out of service also afforded the company ample opportunity to develop effective fire safety policies and procedures, yet, as this case demonstrates, the Universe Explorer did not have them in place at the time of the fire. As described earlier in this analysis, the company had poor policies and procedures in the following areas:    Fire Drills--Crew emergency drills did not stress using alternate routes; as a result, panicking crewmen failed to locate an alternate egress timely or at all. Passenger drills were not realistic and did not include information about safety features, such as the fire doors, causing some passengers to panic.     Alert--Activated alarms first sounded on the bridge, delaying early emergency notification to those endangered. Fire doors--Emergency procedures required that the presence of a fire be verified in person by a watchman before closing the fire doors. Communications--The UHF radios provided to emergency responders did not provide the communications capability to ensure the safety of the fire watch and fire teams, which, in turn, was needed to ensure the safety of passengers and crewmembers. Tracking of Responders--The fire watch and the safety officer did not have a person assigned to back them up, placing them at increased risk if they were injured during response activities. Fire Locating--The officers directing the fire search did not use a methodical approach employing more than one search team, resulting in a delay in locating the fire. Search and Rescue--Vessel management did not have a systematic method for locating trapped crewmembers and thus prolonged their exposure to smoke and contributed to the severity of their injuries. Fire Watch Supervision--The shipboard manager did not properly monitor the work of the fire watch, who was required to ensure that fire doors were not tied open.        According to the company, its shoreside officials periodically visit the ship to confer with vessel officers and attend classification society surveys and Coast Guard examinations. In the Board's opinion, these actions alone are not sufficient to provide adequate management oversight and to ensure effective fire safety aboard the vessel. These meetings typically exclude personnel who are not in upper shipboard management. Effective management oversight must extend beyond upper shipboard managers to include personnel from all levels in the shipboard organization. Only through inclusion may commitment to safety be attained in all levels of the shipboard organization. If more effective management oversight of safety had been exercised on the Universe Explorer, crewmembers would not have compromised the effectiveness of the fire doors by tying them open, the fire watch would have been more mindful that he needed to report his findings to the watch officer, and the watch officer would have been more concerned about the safety of the fire watch. The company needs to foster the attitude among its crews that fire safety is preeminent in its vessel operations and that their actions directly affect the safe operation of the ship. The Safety Board concludes that shoreside management did not exercise effective oversight of fire safety on the Universe Explorer. V. Ships, the operator of the Universe Explorer, has advised the Safety Board that it is developing a safety management system for its passenger ships as required by the ISM Code. The Board questions whether this system will address the safety management deficiencies noted in this report. The Safety Board therefore believes that the New Commodore, through its        operator, V. Ships, should address the safety issues identified in this report in its ISM system. Moreover, it should increase the management oversight of fire safety on board company vessels by initiating, at a minimum, the following measures: establishing procedures for periodic fire safety vessel examinations by shoreside management officials, revising fire alarm response procedures to require immediate closing of remotely activated fire doors, and periodically instructing ships' crews on maintaining a fire-safe vessel. it had been removed. The Safety Board concludes that the ABS's process for approving a plan or for verifying that submitted plans are accurate is not as rigorous as it ought to be. The Board therefore believes that the ABS should evaluate its plan review procedures and institute improved safeguards to ensure that ship plans submitted for approval accurately depict the actual vessel configuration. In postaccident communication with Safety Board staff, the ABS stated that the laundry bulkhead did not have to be in place for the vessel to comply with ABS classification requirements or the statutory requirements of the flag administration, Panama, at the time of the casualty. The ABS cited SOLAS 48 as the basis for its contention. In fact, SOLAS 48, as interpreted by CFR 46, stipulates that type 2 stairways should not give direct access to enclosed spaces in which a fire may originate. The original owner and the Coast Guard considered the main laundry corridor bulkhead not only practicable but necessary to achieve an adequate measure of fire safety on the vessel. The ABS classed the newly constructed vessel. With the exception of the 8-year period when the ship was classed by LR, the ABS surveyed and classed the ship throughout its life, reviewing and approving various fire control plans, all of which indicate that the main laundry had a corridor bulkhead. After the fire, when advised that the bulkhead had been removed, an ABS official maintained that the bulkhead was not required by SOLAS 48. The Safety Board is disturbed by the ABS's postaccident interpretation of the international requirements. Removing the bulkhead reduced the level of fire safety, which is not permitted by SOLAS. For the ABS to interpret that the laundry bulkhead once required by SOLAS 48 can be removed indicates that the classification agency has effectively accepted the degradation of fire safety on this passenger vessel.  Class and Coast Guard Oversight--This accident raises questions about the adequacy of the ABS survey and Coast Guard control verification procedures and the resulting thoroughness of their inspections.  ABS reviews--The ABS checks an ABSclassed vessel's approved plans against its internal arrangements when a new owner initially applies for classification or after a structural modification authorized by the ABS has been made to the vessel, but not during its routine annual surveys. The ABS exercised the primary inspection responsibility over the Universe Explorer. Not only did it conduct annual and special surveys for the purpose of confirming that the vessel met classification rules for insurance purposes, it also acted in a regulatory capacity on behalf of the flag administration (Panama) to ensure that the vessel complied with applicable SOLAS requirements. In 1991, the ABS approved a fire control plan for the Universe Explorer that incorrectly showed a corridor bulkhead in the main laundry. The Safety Board is concerned that the ABS approved a vessel plan, especially a plan as critical as the fire control plan, that did not accurately depict the ship's configuration. If the classification society's survey procedures were efficient, its surveyors should have found this discrepancy and, at a minimum, required the fire control plan be corrected in 1991. In correspondence with the Safety Board after the fire, the ABS stated that it had no documents on file regarding the bulkhead and did not know when  Coast Guard reviews--The Coast Guard currently checks a foreign-registered passenger vessel's approved plans when the vessel first enters service in the United States or when it undergoes a major structural modification. In    the case of the Universe Explorer, the vessel happened to first enter U.S. service as a foreign passenger ship during a 5-year period when the Coast Guard did not require a plan review as part of the initial CVE. Since the late 1980s, the Coast Guard had regularly conducted annual and quarterly CVEs of the Universe Explorer. NVIC 1-93, which contains the procedures that Coast Guard inspectors are to follow when conducting CVEs, does not specifically describe how and to what extent they should check fire boundaries. For example, instructions for the quarterly CVE state that the extent of the vessel examination is ""at the discretion of the attending inspectors"" and is determined by the observed condition of the ship. Instructions for a general walk-through stipulate only that the inspectors should check the engine room, machinery spaces, and accommodation spaces. On July 20, 1996, one week before the fatal fire, Coast Guard inspectors conducted a quarterly CVE during which they held a fire drill in the main laundry, yet they did not notice that the bulkhead shown on the fire control plan was not in place. This raises the question of whether the inspectors even referred to the plan in the course of conducting the drill. The Safety Board concludes that the Coast Guard plan review and examination procedures of foreign passenger vessels do not adequately address the need to verify structural fire protection boundaries. The Safety Board therefore believes that the Coast Guard should revise its control verification procedures to include a more detailed review of structural fire protection features on board foreign passenger ships. The Board further believes that the Coast Guard should require that foreign passenger ships operating from U.S. ports undergo a periodic structural fire protection plan review and vessel examination. Further, the ICCL should remind member passenger ship operators of the degradation to structural fire protection that results from removing or altering fire control boundaries and of their responsibility to maintain the fire safety of their vessels in accordance with approved fire control plans.  Toxicological Testing As mentioned earlier, crewmembers who were tested showed no indication of having used drugs or alcohol. In this case, the fire watch, who was known to have been in the main laundry within 20 minutes of a fire detector activating in the area, was not tested for either drugs or alcohol. Company officials did not designate any crewmember for testing until late July 27, 1996, and only then at the request of Safety Board investigators. Specimens were not collected from the designated individuals until at least 34 hours after the accident. In reviewing the regulatory requirements for testing, the Safety Board found that the wording in the CFR regarding who should undergo postaccident toxicological testing is not specific. The regulations at 46 CFR Subpart 4.06 state that following a serious marine incident, ""the marine employer shall take all practicable steps to have each individual engaged or employed on board a vessel who is directly involved in the incident chemically tested for evidence of drug and alcohol use"" and to ensure that specimens are collected ""as soon as practicable."" The term individual directly involved in a serious marine incident is defined at 46 CFR 4.03-4 as ""an individual whose order, action or failure to act is determined to be, or cannot be ruled out as, a causative factor in the events leading to or causing a serious marine incident."" The Safety Board concludes that, in the absence of specific criteria, an immediate determination of the individual(s) directly involved in a serious marine incident who should be considered for drug and alcohol testing is sometimes difficult. The Board has long been concerned about the timeliness and adequacy of postaccident drug and alcohol testing in the maritime industry and will address those issues in its forthcoming report of the Julie N tankship collision with a highway bridge in Portland, Maine. In the interim, the Board believes that the Coast Guard should meet with maritime industry representatives to establish specific criteria for identifying those individuals who should undergo drug and    alcohol testing after a serious marine incident and to establish procedures to ensure that such identification is made and subsequent testing is conducted in a timely manner. quality in smoke-affected areas, and maintained a reflash watch. The resources involved in the response were adequate to meet the needs of the emergency. All injured people were treated and transported in a timely manner to appropriate medical facilities in Juneau or Seattle. Uninjured passengers were safely and efficiently transported to lodgings or to alternative transportation ashore. The Safety Board concludes that the response by the Coast Guard and the local authorities to the Universe Explorer fire was timely and appropriate.  Emergency Actions by Local Responders Coast Guard Response--The Universe Explorer radioed the 17th Coast Guard District within minutes of discovering the fire. Coast Guard vessels were dispatched expeditiously and arrived in time to be effective during the emergency. The Coast Guard cutter Sweetbrier, which had overheard the emergency transmission and had radioed the SAR coordinator that it was immediately proceeding to assist, reached the passenger ship within about 1 hour. The Sweetbrier commanding officer assumed the role of on-scene coordinator for the Coast Guard. The cutter then escorted the Universe Explorer to Auke Bay, where the Sweetbrier's crew assisted in transporting breathing apparatus and oxygen to the passenger vessel. Meanwhile, shoreside Coast Guard personnel coordinated the response of local agencies to the emergency. Local Agency Response--Upon receiving notification of the fire emergency on board the Universe Explorer, area police, fire departments, and rescue agencies responded promptly. The CCF/R fire chief implemented the local contingency plan and arranged for area firefighters trained in marine firefighting to receive a briefing about the fire on the Universe Explorer before the vessel reached Auke Bay Harbor. When the local firefighters arrived on board the passenger ship, they examined the fire scene and verified that the fire was completely out. They then briefed Coast Guard and vessel officers about their findings, monitored the air  Guard Fire Contingency Plan was incomplete. Although committees had been formed to prepare certain parts of the plan, the sections dealing with the evacuation and treatment of multiple casualties from a major cruise ship accident had not been developed. Consequently, the evacuation and treatment of injured people from the Universe Explorer were conducted in an ad hoc manner. However, about 4 months before the Universe Explorer fire, the Coast Guard had held a command post exercise designed to test and evaluate existing plans, procedures, systems, and interactions. This exercise, which Federal, State, local, and cruise industry officials attended, simulated a fire on and the grounding of a large foreign cruise vessel, with resulting injuries and pollution. The March 1996 table-top exercise gave the Coast Guard and emergency responders an opportunity to consider and discuss what assistance was needed should a major cruise ship accident occur in the local area. This exercise may have prepared responders to perform effectively in this incident, even though their formal response plan had not been set in writing.  Coast Guard Fire Contingency PlanAt the time of this accident, the Coast   CONCLUSIONS  Findings 1. Factors related to the vessel navigation system, propulsion systems, and mechanical equipment neither caused nor contributed to the accident. All officers were properly licensed and qualified to serve in their positions. No available evidence indicated that drugs or alcohol affected the performance of those officers and crewmembers tested. 2. The fire on board the Universe Explorer originated in one of two laundry bins that had been against the forward bulkhead of the main laundry. 3. Accidental ignition sources, such as faulty electrical equipment, wiring arcing, or contact with a hot surface or air, did not cause the fire aboard the Universe Explorer. 4. Neither discarded smoking material, spontaneous combustion, nor a deliberate act can be ruled out as possible causes of the fire on board the Universe Explorer. 5. The UHF radio alone did not provide the communications capability to ensure the safety of the fire watch, which, in turn, was needed to ensure the safety of passengers and crewmembers. 6. If the Universe Explorer had been equipped with an internal radio antenna system, radio communications would have been more effective during the fire emergency. 7. The communication procedures between the bridge officer and the watchman during the emergency were inadequate. 8. The lack of a means to call for help delayed the rescue of trapped crewmen and contributed to the severity of their injuries.  9. The inability of the shipboard medical staff to communicate with each other by radio negatively affected the timeliness of the care provided to people injured in this accident. 10. Removing the corridor bulkhead in the main laundry was an alteration to the vessel that seriously degraded the fire safety condition of the Universe Explorer. 11. Greater fire protection can laundry facilities by using a different types of detection as an automatic suppression be attained in combination of devices as well system.  12. Improved surveillance of high-fire-risk areas would enhance the fire safety condition on board the Universe Explorer. 13. If the Universe Explorer had been equipped with an automatic sprinkler system, the large quantities of smoke and resulting loss of life may have been avoided. 14. Had automatic closure of the fire doors been incorporated in the fire detection system, the fire doors in the area where the fire broke out would have shut immediately when nearby detectors activated, thereby preventing the spread of lethal amounts of smoke to the crew berthing areas on the Aloha deck. 15. The effectiveness of the fire doors to the crew corridors on Aloha deck was compromised by their being tied open, degrading crew safety and contributing to the number of deaths in the accident. 16. Improved oversight of the performance of the fire watch is needed to ensure an acceptable level of fire safety on board the Universe Explorer.    17. The lack of an automatic smoke alarm that sounded locally in the crew berthing area delayed prompt notification to the crew of the fire and the need to evacuate. Had the crewmembers who died received earlier warning, they may have escaped. 18. The crewmembers' implementation of evacuation procedures was effective in maintaining calm and order and in ensuring that passengers vacated their cabins and assembled at their muster stations. 19. The Universe Explorer's operating procedures that the watch officer is supposed to follow when a fire alarm activates are less than adequate to ensure the timely establishment of fire boundaries restricting the spread of heat and smoke. 20. Although the passenger fire drill held on the Universe Explorer was conducted in a timely manner, the content of the exercise did not fully prepare many passengers to meet the demands of an actual fire emergency. 21. The Universe Explorer crew did not adequately address passenger concerns about the fire and the seriousness of the situation while they were assembled at their muster stations. 22. Some of the deceased crewmembers on the Universe Explorer may not have survived the fire because they lacked sufficient knowledge of alternate escape routes from their berthing area. 23. Had the officers directing the fire search used a more methodical approach employing more than one search team, they might have located the fire sooner. 24. Efforts to locate and rescue trapped crewmembers were not initiated in a timely manner. The delayed search of Aloha deck crew cabins prolonged the trapped crewmen's exposure to smoke and contributed to the severity of their injuries. 25. If the Universe Explorer had had a properly equipped rescue team that was trained in locating and recovering people trapped in smoke-filled areas, the crewmen probably would have been rescued sooner and would have sustained less severe injuries; moreover, fewer crewmen may have died. 26. The lack of a secondary supply of oxygen limited the medical staff's ability to treat the injured. 27. Management did not exercise effective oversight of fire safety on the Universe Explorer. 28. The American Bureau for approving a plan submitted plans are rigorous as it ought to of Shipping's process or for verifying that accurate is not as be.  29. The Coast Guard procedures used in conducting control verification examinations of foreign passenger vessels do not adequately address the need to verify structural fire protection boundaries. 30. In the absence of specific criteria, an immediate determination of the individual(s) directly involved in a serious marine incident who should be considered for drug and alcohol testing is sometimes difficult. 31. The response by the Coast Guard and local authorities to the Universe Explorer fire was timely and appropriate.     Probable Cause The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was a lack of effective oversight by New Commodore Cruise Line, Ltd. and the predecessor of V. Ships Marine, Ltd. (International Marine Carriers, Inc.), who allowed physical conditions and operating procedures to exist that  compromised the fire safety of the Universe Explorer, ultimately resulting in crewmember deaths and injuries from a fire of undetermined origin in the vessel's main laundry. Contributing to the loss of life and injuries was the lack of sprinkler systems, the lack of automatic localsounding fire alarms, and the rapid spread of smoke through open doors into the crew berthing area.   RECOMMENDATIONS As a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the following recommendations: --To the U.S. Coast Guard: Propose to the International Maritime Organization that passenger ships be required to institute procedures, upgrade equipment, or do both to establish reliable internal radio communications from anywhere inside a vessel during an emergency.

BLACK Member  April 14, 1998     APPENDIX A INVESTIGATION The Safety Board was notified of this accident on the morning of July 27, 1996. Five investigators from the Safety Board's Washington, D.C., headquarters were dispatched to Juneau, Alaska, arriving that same night. Investigators immediately met with representatives of local emergency response agencies, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the operator of the Universe Explorer and made arrangements to board the vessel early the next morning to begin interviewing witnesses and examining the fire scene. The on-scene investigation continued until August 3, 1996. The following organizations were parties in the investigation: New Commodore Cruise Lines, Ltd., representing the owner of the Universe Explorer; International Marine Carriers, Inc., which was the operator of the Universe Explorer at the time of the accident; U.S. Coast Guard; National Institute of Occupational Health & Safety (NIOSH); State of Alaska; City of Juneau; and Republic of Panama. The Safety Board investigated this accident under the authority of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974. The report is based on the information developed as a result of the investigation and on additional analysis done by the Safety Board. The Safety Board has considered all facts in the investigative record that are pertinent to its statutory responsibility to determine the cause or probable cause of the accident and to make recommendations.   this page intentionally left blank     APPENDIX B DUTIES OF THE UNIVERSE EXPLORER FIRE WATCH 1.

Ensure the completion of all fire rounds within the specified periods, punching the clock at all assigned locations. (Each round should take about 50 minutes.) Any divergence from the usual round (or missing checkpoints) should be recorded in the Fire Patrol log.  5. Report to the bridge directly following each round. Keep the watch officer informed of any problems encountered. The following situations should be immediately reported to the Safety Officer/Watch Officer:   Fights, brawls, or vandalism; Passengers/crew involved in suspicious/illegal activities, such as drugs or lethal weapons; Passengers/crew in off-limits areas; Crewmembers in passenger cabins; Discrepancies in safety equipment (ensure that all fire screen doors, including permanently closed doors, are not blocked or lashed open).  3. Use the UHF radio provided to communicate with the bridge, the Safety Officer, or the Security Officer. Perform ""radio checks"" with the watch officer on each round, from different locations throughout the vessel. The radio carried by the patrolman must be set on channel 4 at all times, and have its volume set to a level at which the patrolman will not miss any communication from the bridge.      4. Be alert and vigilant at all times; use all senses to try to detect smoke or fire (e.g. from the smell of smoke or other unusual   this page intentionally left blank     APPENDIX C RETROACTIVE FIRE SAFETY AMENDMENTS FOR EXISTING PASSENGER SHIPS            Adoption of amendments to chapter II-2 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 Fire safety measures for existing passenger ships The MARITIME SAFETY COMMITTEE, RECALLING Article 28(b) of the Convention on the International Maritime Organization concerning the functions of the Committee, RECALLING FURTHER Article VIII(b) of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, hereinafter referred to as ""the Convention,"" concerning the procedures for amending the annex to the Convention, other than the provisions of chapter I, BEING CONCERNED about recent serious fire casualties resulting in the loss of human life, RECOGNIZING that there is a compelling and urgent need to improve the fire safe measures for existing passenger ships, HAVING CONSIDERED at its sixtieth session amendments to the Convention proposed and circulated in accordance with article VIII(b)(i) thereof, 1.

The plan is a guide for the FTA's response to the OHS Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). The Transit Threat Level Response Recommendation, in turn, provides guidance to the U.S. transit industry in responding to the various OHS threat level designations.        Introduction and Background   The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), in response to the Office of Homeland Security (OHS), has defined the following plan to guide transit response to the HSAS as defined in Homeland Security Presidential Directive #3. The plan establishes a consistent and coordinated transit response to potential threats in order to protect transit passengers, employees, and infrastructure, and to support community emergency response efforts. Further, the plan is compatible with the way transit operates:     Transit relies on an inherently open architecture, allowing free movement of passengers in public facilities and vehicles. This freedom of movement must be maintained to permit transit to perform its basic functions.      Transit is geographically widespread, often operating on public infrastructure and requiring important interagency cooperation to ensure protection.      There is great diversity in how police and security forces are provided and deployed at different transit systems. There is no national mandate to standardize this facet of transit operations and security force policies will remain a local agency decision.      Transit functions include substantial differences in equipment, infrastructure, operations and security practices from agency to agency. While this plan provides general guidance for response to individual threat conditions, the details of specific implementation vary substantially throughout these agencies.      Transit systems are routinely under surveillance by their operating staff (e.g., drivers, supervisors, station attendants, and controllers), security employees, and, with increasing frequency, transit passengers. This normal level of vigilance, supplemented by appropriate awareness training and the protective measures identified under threat condition green/blue, may be sufficient vigilance for some systems.          Threat Level/Attack/Recovery Systems Approach   The FTA National Transit Response Model supplements the existing HSAS Threat Condition model with Black and Purple designations to further define appropriate transit industry activities when an attack is in progress and during the post-event recovery of transit services and facilities.           Color   Condition       Green   Low threat level       Blue   General threat level       Yellow   Elevated threat level       Orange   High threat level       Red   Severe threat level                  Black   Actual Attack       Purple   Recovery             The Black and Purple designations are interpreted as follows.     Black indicates that an attack is underway against a specific transit agency or within the agency's immediate geographic area. The Black state is entered only when an attack has occurred. Black includes the immediate post-attack time period when the transit agency may be responding to casualties, assisting in evacuations, inspecting and securing transit facilities, or helping with other tasks directed by the local emergency management authority.      Purple indicates the recovery of transit service after an attack has occurred. Purple includes restoration of levels of service, routes, and schedules, repairing or reopening facilities, adjustment of staff work schedules and duty assignments, responding to customer inquiries about services, and other activities necessary to restore transit service. The Purple state follows the Black state and may also exist for short time periods when the agency is transitioning from a higher threat condition to a lower threat condition (e.g., from Red to Orange). The Purple state will coexist with the prevailing threat condition. In other words, business recovery (Purple) will be accomplished while maintaining the prevailing readiness status (e.g., Orange protective measures).          Threat Level Information   The Attorney General makes the decision to change the OHS threat level. Changes in threat levels typically will be in sequential stepwise order. As conditions warrant, elevated threat levels will typically progress in order from lowest (green) to highest (red). Likewise, as conditions warrant, returning from higher to lower threat levels will typically progress sequentially.   Transit response posture may vary depending on the nature of the threat level. For example, threat guidance focused on the northeastern region may dictate that transit agencies in that region maintain a higher response posture than other regions of the country. If the guidance is modal-based, for example a threat to subways and transit agencies with subway modes may maintain a higher response posture than agencies without subways. In fact, large multi-modal transit agencies may operate their different modes with different response postures.   However, based on information and conditions, transit agencies should be prepared for the distinct possibility of a non-sequential threat level advisory. For example, if information and conditions warrant, a current threat advisory level of ""Yellow"" could be directly elevated to ""Red.""   Transit agencies must work collaboratively with their local and regional emergency management organizations, joint terrorism task force, police agencies, and other organizations. Each transit agency is responsible for determining its own appropriate response posture, based on an assessment of the guidance received from all sources and the response posture of the communities where the agency provides service.       FTA Recommended Protective Measures/Activities for Transit Agencies   The FTA recommends the threat level protective measures and activities for transit agencies as suggested or recommended actions, not required actions. While each transit agency should implement measures/activities appropriate to its own operating environment, the following general guidelines apply:     The threat/risk goes up with each successive level.   Responses are additive; each level incorporates all activities from the previous levels.   Threat information may be general or indicated for different geographical regions of the country, metro areas, cities, transit agencies, industries, facility types (e.g., subway, tunnel, bus, control center, etc.), or for a specific facility.   Specific implementation must be determined by the transit agency in light of actual events; protective measures for a higher level than officially designated may be implemented by the transit agency. For example, if the threat advisory level is elevated from ""Yellow"" to ""Orange"" a transit agency may elect to implement not only ""Orange"" level suggested protective measures, but also some ""Red"" level protective measures.       The following table presents specific transit industry protective measures in response to the HSAS threat level conditions, as well as for the actual attack and post-attack/recovery phases.          FTA Recommended Transit Protective Measures: GREEN   Low Condition (Green). This condition is declared when there is a low risk of terrorist attacks.        Measure 1.

GX034-55-2247952	"DOI ARRESTS FDNY LIEUTENANT FOR FORGING CITY PARKING PLACARDS    THURSDAY, JUNE 25,1998 -- EDWARD J. KURIANSKY, Commissioner of the Department of Investigation (DOI), today announced the felony arrest of KEVIN J. DOWLING, a lieutenant in the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), for creating phony, computer-generated FDNY parking placards.    Commissioner Kuriansky explained that certain authorized members of the Fire Department are issued official parking placards that allow them to park in otherwise restricted areas while they are on official Department business. DOWLING, who is assigned to the FDNY's Public Information Bureau, was never issued such a placard. Instead, it is charged, DOWLING used his home computer to generate three facsimiles of an official FDNY placard. DOWLING allegedly used one placard for his personal vehicle and gave the others to his wife and a consultant who worked for the Fire Department.     ""By displaying the counterfeit placards on the dashboards of their cars, the defendant and his cohorts could park in restricted `No Parking,' `No Standing Except Trucks,' and `Meter' zones without fear of being ticketed or towed,"" said Commissioner Kuriansky, noting that the scheme was uncovered last month when a Fire Department employee noticed that a car using one of the placards was improperly parked near FDNY headquarters in Brooklyn.     DOWLING, 35, of Queens, New York, was charged with three counts of Attempted Forgery in the Second Degree, a Class E felony punishable up to 4 years in prison. He has been a member of the Emergency Medical Service (now part of the Fire Department) since 1984. He has been suspended without pay.     The investigation was conducted by Felicia A. Mennin, DOI's Inspector General for the Fire Department, and members of her staff, including Chief Investigator Frank Smith.    The Office of Queens County District Attorney Richard A. Brown is prosecuting the case. James Liander, Deputy Chief of the Integrity Bureau, is handling the matter.     -30-    FOR MORE INFORMATION -- CONTACT: KEVIN RYAN (212)825-5931                                                                                                                    Go    to   Top Page  |  DOI Press Releases  |  DOI Home Page  |   NYC.gov  Home Page   Mayor's Office  |  City Agencies  |  Services  |  News and Features  |  City Life   Contact Us  |  Search           Copyright© 1998"
GX008-26-8860226	"Testimony of   Jim Hall, Chairman   National Transportation Safety Board   before the   Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure   Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation   House of Representatives   Regarding   Coast Guard Search and Rescue Communications   November 3, 1999   as presented  |  for the record      oral testimony as presented:   Good morning, Chairman Gilchrest and members of the Committee. It is a pleasure to represent the National Transportation Safety Board before you today regarding the subject of Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) communications.  Before I begin, however, I'd like to thank the Coast Guard and in particular, Admiral Rick Larribee and the men and women of the Coast Guard's First District, for their endeavors in the SAR effort that concluded Monday and the on-going search and recovery for the victims of the crash of EgyptAir flight 990. We can all be proud of the dedication and professionalism of these individuals.  Mr. Chairman, it is noteworthy that the Morning Dew investigation did not identify the actual search by Coast Guard boat and helicopter crews as an issue in this accident. Once the SAR was initiated, it proceeded well. But, in order for a SAR to take place, Coast Guard communications and operations personnel must receive, acknowledge, and act upon a distress situation. In the case of the Morning Dew, this did not occur until after the Coast Guard SAR personnel were notified at 11:15 a.m. on December 29, 1997, some eight hours after the first mayday call from the vessel.  You have been given a packet of visual aids, including a  chronology of events , that will help clarify my remarks.  The issues addressed in the Safety Board's report of the Morning Dew accident included: the need for upgrading Coast Guard SAR communications equipment; the adequacy of watchstander duty hours; the need for upgrading watchstander procedures for responding to an emergency; the need for additional training for communications watchstanders; management oversight of watchstander performance; and, the lack of investigation coordination.              Morning Dew    The owner of the Morning Dew was moving the vessel from South Carolina, to Florida, via the Intracoastal Waterway. However, on the afternoon of December 28, 1997, the vessel was seen proceeding outbound and toward the open ocean.             Salvaging Morning Dew    Just after 2:00 a.m., the Morning Dew struck the north side of the north rock jetty extending from the harbor at Charleston, tearing open the hull.  The paint markings and debris path documented by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources show that the vessel was carried over the jetty, resulting in the vessel's coming to rest submerged in about 12 feet of water on the south side of the jetty.           At 2:17 a.m., a Coast Guard communications watchstander received a static-filled radio message.  The watchstander told the Board that the only words he heard were ""U.S. Coast Guard."" When the tape was replayed much later, the voice of an excited adolescent male was heard saying, ""May ... mayday, U.S. Coast Guard come in."" Although the watchstander tried to raise someone on the radio, he received no response.  About 6:20 a.m., the bosun of an inbound freighter heard cries for help coming from the water near buoy 22 as the ship entered Charleston Harbor. This was reported by telephone to the Coast Guard. When contacted, the Coast Guard duty officer decided to take no action.  A full Coast Guard search was not initiated until the bodies of two of the teenage victims were found just off shore about 11:00 a.m. The other teenager was found soon after, and the owner was not found until about three weeks later.  The Board found a number of deficiencies that we delineated in our written testimony, but I will focus my oral testimony on the equipment issues.  The Board's investigation of the Morning Dew accident sought to evaluate the adequacy of equipment resources available to the Coast Guard communication center watchstanders when they receive a call for assistance from a distressed mariner. Unfortunately, a number of significant deficiencies with the communication systems were found, such as:              Operation testing on the direction finding equipment at Group Charleston showed it had inaccuracies of up to 101 degrees and was not being used. It was designed to provide a line of bearing to, rather than the geographic location of, the transmitting radio, and could not record the bearing information for later review and correlation to recorded audio transmissions.     Some antennas and towers needed maintenance; however, there was no program to specifically inspect antenna towers. The Mount Pleasant antenna was located on a tower along with several other commercial antennas, causing interference at certain frequencies, and the quality of the telephone lines used to connect the group communications centers to the antenna high sites were less than optimum.     The recorder in use by the watchstander was difficult to operate when searching for specific recorded communications, and was not suitable for a quick replay of recorded messages.        DF Equipment Area        DF Equipment Monitor Screen           DF System 101 o  Indication Error           As part of the Board's investigation, Safety Board staff met with representatives of the Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station regarding their Coast Guard SAR communications.  The Prince Rupert radio station has been using a commercially available DF system in SAR operations since 1992. These off-the-shelf commercial DF systems are currently being manufactured by several companies in the United States and elsewhere.  We were advised that the Canadian DF system is easy to use, accurate, and capable of determining the geographic location of a transmitting radio through triangulation. Because this equipment is located on top of mountains, it is capable of receiving from sixty to eighty miles. It can also digitally record bearing information for later retrieval and analysis.  According to the Canadian Coast Guard, this DF system has reduced SAR response time by eliminating time-consuming searches for vessels in distress. As soon as the station receives a transmission, it also knows the vessel's location. The system can locate vessels in distress when incomplete calls are received. Because the equipment can also locate a hoax caller, it has reduced these nuisance calls, resulting in a reduction of unnecessary SAR missions and cost savings.  The Prince Rupert Marine Communications and Traffic Services station also has recording equipment to record all incoming and outgoing radio communications. The recording equipment consists of separate units for instant playback and for longer term archival recording. Unlike the equipment at Group Charleston at the time of the Morning Dew accident, it allows for quick replay of a message if there is any doubt about its content.  We are aware of the Coast Guard's national distress and response system modernization project, which has been in various stages of development for 20 years. Unfortunately, the initial operational capability is not scheduled until fiscal year 2003, with full operational capability in the 2005-2006 timeframe. In the interim, the Coast Guard intends to install new DF equipment at selected communication centers in areas having significant SAR activity, allocating $2 million in fiscal year 2000 for the procurement of the equipment.  It is our understanding that the interim DF equipment will be similar in capability to equipment now in place at communication centers, and will only provide a line of bearing to the transmitting vessel and will not have the ability to record the DF data. The Board believes that this equipment will not significantly improve the Coast Guard's ability to effectively respond to a distress call. The Coast Guard should immediately begin to equip all SAR communications centers with currently available, commercial, off-the-shelf DF systems that provide, at a minimum, the capability to establish a position fix and to record position data for later retrieval and analysis.  We recognize that over the last few years the Coast Guard has had its budget and personnel significantly reduced. However, it is the Coast Guard's responsibility to inform this Committee of the minimum resources required to ensure public safety.  That completes my statement and I will be happy to respond to whatever questions the Committee may have.      written testimony for the record:   Good morning Chairman Gilchrest and members of the Committee. It is a pleasure to represent the National Transportation Safety Board before you today regarding the subject of Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) communications.  The Coast Guard's 1998 Annual Report states that ""The Coast Guard seeks to save all mariners in imminent danger."" And, they have a good record of achieving that goal. In 1998, the Coast Guard responded to approximately 38,700 distress calls and saved more than 4,000 lives. However, in December 1997, the distress call from the 34-foot recreational sailing vessel  Morning Dew  was not responded to, and the lives of the four individuals aboard were not saved. The Safety Board's investigation of that accident found serious deficiencies in the Coast Guard's communication system. My testimony will focus on those findings and our recommendations to correct the problems we found.  In addition to the accident involving the  Morning Dew,  the Safety Board has investigated five additional marine accidents involving Coast Guard communications since 1993.  August 4, 1993  - At 12:08 a.m., the operator of the sailing vessel  Rite of Passage  notified the Coast Guard that the vessel was disabled near the Isle of Palms, South Carolina, with engine problems and that he needed assistance. Believing that the operator was in no immediate danger, the watchstander classified the incident as a non-distress situation, issued a marine assistance request, and a local towing company advised that they would respond. At 1:00 a.m., the Coast Guard received a telephone call from the Isle of Palms Police Department reporting that an unidentified sailing vessel was aground and listing badly. The Coast Guard then dispatched a 41-foot utility boat to respond to what was thought to be a second vessel in distress. At 5:50 a.m., a local rescue squad recovered the operator's body from the surf. If the watchstander had asked the operator the questions on the SAR checklist, he would have learned that the operator was a 67-year-old man with a heart condition requiring medication, and may have increased the urgency of the situation and indicated a need for an immediate Coast Guard response.  August 21, 1994  - A disabled 18-foot Questar motorboat with the vessel's owner and one passenger on board capsized while being towed by the Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel  Puppet  near Juneau, Alaska, resulting in one fatality. Events surrounding this accident suggest that the SAR response was hampered by the undisciplined use of VHF-FM channel 16 by participants in a fishing derby. The Safety Board found that the Coast Guard made no attempt to minimize inappropriate use of channel 16 by the approximately 1,000 vessels participating in the fishing derby. The sheer volume of inappropriate radio traffic on a channel that was supposed to be reserved for calling out and distress severely compromised the Coast Guard's ability to receive and respond to distress calls. As a result of this accident, the Safety Board issued recommendations to the Coast Guard regarding radio reception capability, the use of Coast Guard Auxiliary resources, SAR policies, and post-accident toxicological testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel.  April 14, 1995  - An 18-foot-long Thunderbird Cheyenne motorboat capsized in about 16 feet of water, in Oswego, New York, resulting in the deaths of all three occupants. Another boater saw the capsized vessel and reported the sighting and the location to someone at a local marina. The marina operator called Coast Guard Station Oswego and relayed the report. The watchstander at Station Oswego notified the duty officer of the call, but the duty officer decided that no immediate action should be taken. The boat was found the next day by a local law enforcement marine patrol boat after the boat was reported overdue.  June 13, 1998  - A distress call from the recreational boat  Florida Air Specialist,  which was in Apalachee Bay, Florida, for recreational fishing with three people on board ,  was logged by Coast Guard Auxiliary watchstanders as a hoax. The Coast Guard did not initiate a review of the recorded radio communications until after the only survivor of the accident reported that a distress call had been transmitted. Had no one survived the  Florida Air  accident, the Coast Guard may not have known that the distress call had been made. The investigation into this accident is on going.  January 18, 1999  - About noon, the  Adriatic , with four people on board, completed clam harvesting operations and began the trip from the fishing grounds off the coast of Long Beach Island, New Jersey to Atlantic City, New Jersey. At about 2:58 p.m., the operator radioed a mayday to the Coast Guard. Watchstanders from three units converged onto the airwaves all within the first few seconds, overlapping one another. In addition, another Coast Guard unit made an unscheduled marine information broadcast at the same moment the call outs were initiated. All four people are missing from this vessel. The Board's investigation is on going.  Like these accidents, the  Morning Dew  tragedy involved Coast Guard communications. The Safety Board was first informed about this accident in April 1998, when several Members of Congress asked that we conduct an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident, and to review the Coast Guard's actions following the accident. I want to point out that under our current agreement with the Coast Guard, we were not initially informed about the accident because it did not meet the notification criteria.  As a result of the Congressional requests, we proceeded to conduct an extensive marine accident investigation. More than 35 witnesses were interviewed, and extensive factual information was gathered from the Coast Guard, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), the Charleston Pilots Association, the Charleston Coroner, and family members of the victims. We also contracted with the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center to survey the communications system serving Coast Guard Group Charleston, including two subordinate stations and six antenna high sites stretching from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Savannah, Georgia. The Navy also transcribed more than 300 hours of radio and telephone communications recorded at the Charleston station. In addition, the Board held a public hearing in Charleston in February 1999. The final report was discussed at the October 5, 1999, Board meeting.  The Accident Investigation   The owner of the  Morning Dew  was moving the vessel from a marina near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, via the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), and had purchased the appropriate charts for that trip. The group on board, comprised of the owner, his two sons, ages 16 and 13, and his 14-year-old nephew, got underway a little after noon on December 27, 1997. On the afternoon of December 28, 1997, in Winya Bay, South Carolina, the  Morning Dew  was seen proceeding outbound in the main shipping channel, past the entrance to the ICW, and toward the open ocean.  In order for the  Morning Dew  to exit the bay and reach the open ocean, it had to continue in or near the shipping channel for about seven miles, during which time the boat would pass 12 or more channel markers before reaching the mouth of the bay. Once there, the vessel had to navigate past a 2.2-mile-long jetty before turning right to follow a southwesterly course, along the coast, toward Charleston, South Carolina, about 43 miles away.  From all available evidence, just after 2:00 a.m., the  Morning Dew  struck the north side of the north rock jetty extending from the harbor at Charleston. The paint markings and debris path documented by the SCDNR show that the vessel was carried over the jetty, probably by waves in combination with the rising tide, resulting in the vessel's coming to rest submerged in about 12 feet of water on the south side of the jetty.  At 2:17 a.m., a Coast Guard Group Charleston communications watchstander received a static-filled radio message -- the only words he heard were ""U.S. Coast Guard."" Although he tried to raise someone on the radio, he received no response. Despite having the capability to do so, the watchstander did not replay the recording of the message to determine the nature of the call, nor did he wake his duty officer. Much later, when the tape was finally replayed, the voice of an excited adolescent male was heard saying ""May ... mayday, U.S. Coast Guard come in.""  About 6:20 a.m., the boatswain of the inbound freighter  Pearl Ace  reported hearing cries for help coming from the water near buoy 22 as the ship entered Charleston Harbor. He immediately reported it by radio to the master on the bridge, and the pilot in turn contacted the pilot dispatcher and asked him to relay the information to the Coast Guard. The pilot also asked the operator of the pilot boat  Palmetto State  to search the area where the calls for help had been heard. The search by the  Palmetto State  was unsuccessful.  When the Coast Guard duty officer was contacted regarding the cries for help he decided to take no action, even though Coast Guard resources were available to initiate a search. He later told investigators that he thought the pilot boat could handle the situation.  A full Coast Guard search was not initiated until the bodies of two teenagers were discovered near the beach about 11:00 a.m. The other teenager was found soon after, and the owner was not found until about three weeks later.  Following the accident, the SCDNR initiated a death and boating safety investigation. Despite an SCDNR request to the Coast Guard regarding possible distress calls, the Coast Guard was not forthcoming with information because they were conducting an administrative investigation into the watchstander's actions. In fact, although Coast Guard officials were aware of the mayday call on the evening of December 29, 1997, no one outside the Coast Guard, including the SCDNR or the victims' families, was told about it for more than 2 1/2 months. That failure hampered the SCDNR's investigation. The information regarding the distress call was not released by the Coast Guard until  Boating News  filed a Freedom of Information Act request in February 1998.  Mr. Chairman, the results of the Board's investigation of the  Morning Dew  accident were distressing, particularly with regard to the following areas: the need to upgrade Coast Guard SAR communications equipment; the adequacy of watchstander duty time, and the need to upgrade watchstander procedures for responding to an emergency; the need for additional training for communications watchstanders; and the lack of investigation coordination.  SAR Communications   The Board's investigation of the  Morning Dew  accident sought to evaluate the equipment resources available to the Coast Guard communication center watchstanders when they receive a call for assistance from a distressed mariner. Specifically, we were interested in determining if the radio and recording equipment were adequate, and what means were available to the watchstander to locate a distressed boater when the boater did not or could not provide his location to the Coast Guard. The Board contracted with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to assist in this effort. Unfortunately, a number of significant deficiencies with the communication systems at the Charleston and Mobile group offices, the only two offices surveyed, were found, and suggested that similar problems may exist throughout the Coast Guard. Group Mobile was studied to provide another data point, and because of its connection with the  Florida Air Specialist  accident previously mentioned.  Operational testing on the direction finding (DF) equipment at group Charleston showed it was very inaccurate, had limited features, and thus was not being used. This DF system was designed to only provide a line of bearing to, rather than the geographic location of, the transmitting radio. In addition, it could not record the bearing information for later review and correlation to recorded audio transmissions.  The Navy's assessment of the communication system included an evaluation of the audio recording equipment used in the Coast Guard's communication centers. We found that the recorders in use at Charleston and Mobile were difficult to operate when searching for specific recorded communications. In addition, the recorders were not suitable for quickly replaying recently received messages.  Some antennas and towers needed maintenance, and there was no program to specifically inspect antenna towers. A continuous frequency swept voltage standing wave ratio measurement, which can be used to document antenna bandwidth and identify nulls, had not been performed on the antennas. The antenna at Mount Pleasant, which picked up the  Morning Dew  transmission, was found to be located on a tower along with several other commercial antennas, and tests found some interference from these other antennas at certain frequencies. The noise levels on the telephone lines connecting the Charleston Group Communications Center to the antenna high sites were not being routinely monitored, and the quality of the telephone lines used to connect the group communications centers to the antenna high sites were less than optimum.  As a result of their findings, the Naval Surface Warfare Center recommended the following improvements to optimize the efficiency of the communication system:  · Institute a programmed antenna maintenance program that would improve the early detection of faults;  · Institute a frequency management program to reduce the possibility of signal interference from other transmitters;  · Install a condition-based monitoring system that would provide continuous monitoring of remote equipment; and  · Upgrade the class of telephone service to reduce the possibility of signal degradation through the existing phone lines.  Safety Board staff visited the Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada for information about Canadian Coast Guard SAR communications. We learned that the Prince Rupert radio station has been successfully using a commercially available DF system in SAR operations since 1992. The Prince Rupert Station is one of three Canadian Marine Communications and Traffic Services stations that have radio DF equipment for use in SAR cases. These off-the-shelf commercial DF systems are reasonably priced and are currently being manufactured by several companies in the United States and elsewhere.  The officer-in-charge reported that the Canadian DF system is easy to use, accurate, and capable of determining the geographic location of a transmitting radio to a distance of sixty to eighty miles through triangulation. The system can also digitally record bearing information for later retrieval and analysis. According to the Canadian Coast Guard, the DF system has reduced SAR response time by eliminating time-consuming searches for vessels in distress. As soon as the station receives a transmission, it also knows the vessel's location. The system can locate vessels in distress when incomplete maydays are transmitted, and can provide navigation information to vessels lost in fog, and locate vessels with open microphones. Because the equipment can also identify and locate a hoax caller, it has reduced nuisance calls and unnecessary SAR missions, resulting in a cost savings.  The Prince Rupert Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station also has recording equipment to record all incoming and outgoing radio communications. The recording equipment consists of separate units for instant playback and for longer term archival recording. Unlike the equipment at Group Charleston, it allows for quick replay of a message if there is any doubt about its content.  The Safety Board is aware of the U.S. Coast Guard's national distress and response system modernization project, which has been in various stages of development for 20 years. Unfortunately, the initial operational capability is not scheduled until fiscal year 2003, and full operational capability will not be until the 2005-2006 timeframe. In the interim, the Coast Guard intends to install new DF equipment at selected communication centers in areas having significant SAR activity, and has allocated $2 million in fiscal year 2000 for the procurement of the equipment.  It is our understanding that the interim DF equipment will be similar to equipment now in place at communication centers, and will only provide a line of bearing to the transmitting vessel and will not likely have the ability to record the DF data. The Board believes that this equipment will not significantly improve the Coast Guard's SAR response capability.  Therefore, the Safety Board adopted a recommendation requesting that the Coast Guard immediately provide all SAR communications centers with the capability for watchstanders to easily and instantly replay the most recent recorded radio transmissions, and that they immediately begin to equip all SAR communications centers with currently available, commercial, off-the-shelf DF systems that provide, at a minimum, the capability to establish a position fix and to record position data for later retrieval and analysis.  Group Charleston's Personnel Duty Time, Equipment, and Procedures for Responding to an Emergency   The Board expressed concern that current Coast Guard duty policy does not provide redundancy for listening to communications. Such a procedure is typical during the night, for example, when the operations duty officer is sleeping.  At the time of the  Morning Dew  accident, a newly qualified and inexperienced communications watchstander was on duty, alone, for 6 to 8 hours, and it was during this time that he failed to detect the word ""mayday"" in the 2:17 a.m. transmission and consequently misidentified the call.  In addition, the Coast Guard is currently operating under an interim staffing policy, pending the results of an analysis of workload and staffing of all group and activity functions, that codifies practices in existence at the time of the  Morning Dew's  sinking. It permits communications watchstanders to work 12-hour shifts and sets a supervisory ratio of 1-to-5 for each watchstanding position.  In many communications centers, including Group Charleston, there is only one communications position; thus, the watchstander always stands a solo watch. This leaves watchstanders with no backup if they need to use the restroom; are unable to sustain attention or wakefulness; or benefit from a ""second opinion"" in the case of an unclear call, a unique situation, or concurrent SAR cases.  While the 12-hour watch duration may facilitate scheduling, the Board does not feel it adequately considers the watchstander's ability to perform. Work schedules must not only ensure that duty positions are covered at all times, they must ensure that continuous vigilance by watchstanders is possible and feasible. They must also take into account the need for oversight and supervision of novice watchstanders, so that sleep loss and fatigue do not degrade performance. Sleep loss has immense potential to exacerbate the problems of excessive shift length, monotony, and boredom. Coast Guard telecommunications specialists endure long hours of tedium, make routine radio broadcasts, perform routine administrative tasks, and listen to a drone of routine radio chatter. Without a mechanism for effectively monitoring their performance, a 12-hour watch can result in decreased alertness and diminished vigilance.  The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should develop permanent staffing policies that would require redundancy to monitor incoming radio traffic. This would provide oversight and supervision of relatively inexperienced watchstanders, have a backup in evaluating incoming radio calls, and generally provide redundancy in the overall listening and decision-making process. As a result, we adopted a recommendation that asks the Coast Guard to ensure that the workload and staffing analysis contracted with the Center for Naval Analysis fully incorporates existing human performance research on vigilance, attention, and fatigue in the determination of shift length, shift rotation, and staffing levels at all Coast Guard SAR communications centers.  Communications Center Watchstander Training   The Board's investigation of the  Morning Dew  also examined the training received by the communications center watchstander on duty at the time of the accident. Since his entire experience as a communications watchstander at the time of the accident consisted of 6 months' duty at Group Charleston, we were particularly interested in whether his training adequately prepared him for the position.  Regular Coast Guard communications watchstanders attend a 10-week telecommunications school, during which they learn the operation of various communications equipment, radiotelephone protocols, and procedures for handling different types of communications, including distress messages. After completing the formal classroom training, they must complete the  Group and Stations Communications Watchstander Qualification Guide  and on-the-job training at their assigned communications center. The guide contains five divisions of qualification tasks comprising reading assignments and a number of tasks in each of the 22 divisions to be completed and practiced in sequence by the student, with the help of the instructor. Once candidate watchstanders complete the local on-the-job training, they are required to pass an oral examination by a qualifications review board before they are considered qualified to stand watch unsupervised.  The communications watchstander on duty at the time of the accident had completed on-the-job training on the qualification guide in 3 to 4 weeks, and spent only 20 to 30 minutes before his oral qualification review board. In order to complete his guide in 4 weeks, the candidate watchstander had to complete and master more than 4 to 6 tasks weekly, including completing the associated reading assignments.  The Safety Board believes that novice watchstanders should be provided with ample opportunity to practice what they were taught during their formal schooling and on-the-job training, and to demonstrate a suitable level of proficiency before they are deemed qualified to stand watch.  In addition, the current focus of the training for communications watchstanders is on the proper operation of hardware and the use of standardized responses to typical situations. However, communications watchstanders do not handle only typical situations. They also encounter atypical situations that require them to use analytical skills to make judgments and formulate decisions that may have life-and-death implications. For example, the watchstander in the  Morning Dew  accident failed to take into account such factors as the urgency in the voice of the caller, the time of night, and the prevailing weather when he concluded that the 2:17 a.m. call from the vessel did not require action. Similarly, in regard to the report of cries from the water, the operations duty officer at Group Charleston did not take into account the nature of the report, the credibility of those making the report, or the potential effectiveness of the pilot boat when he allowed that vessel to conduct an independent search even though Coast Guard resources were available.  The Safety Board adopted a safety recommendation to the Coast Guard that calls for implementation of a course or training program for all operations and communications center watchstanders designed to develop or enhance those individuals' judgment and decision-making skills.  Investigation Coordination   Because of questions raised in the months after the  Morning Dew  accident regarding investigation coordination, this issue was of interest to the Board. Throughout the initial response to the accident, the SCNDR, the coroner, and local agencies participated in an Incident Command System (ICS) that allowed them to effectively manage their personnel, resources, and communications.  The ICS allows different agencies with d operating procedures to work together in one system to accomplish a common goal. The ICS also reduces the duplication of effort and the burden that can be placed on people involved in an accident investigation who must obtain similar information from different parties. The fact that the Coast Guard did not participate in this system resulted in a lack of coordination between the Coast Guard and local agencies. For example:  · Both the coroner and the Coast Guard needed information from the families of the deceased. The Coast Guard needed to know how many people had been on the vessel, and the coroner needed to establish their identities and made death notifications. Had the Coast Guard participated in the ICS, Coast Guard representatives would have been aware of the coroner's procedures, and the process would have been much better coordinated.  · The SCDNR investigator-in-charge arrived on scene and was told that the Coast Guard had already requested that a commercial salvage operator send divers to identify the name on the sailboat. The SCDNR investigator-in-charge, wanting to preserve any evidence in case of a criminal investigation, had to tell the divers not to disturb any of the evidence. The preservation of evidence should have been discussed before divers were deployed.  · Although a Coast Guard representative was in telephonic contact with an SCDNR representative and police officials during different phases of the response, the absence of a Coast Guard representative at the command post where decisions were being made resulted in the Coast Guard representative's not being able to efficiently track the progress being made in the joint investigation or to answer any questions. In addition, he was not able to provide information known to the Coast Guard that may have facilitated the SCDNR investigation. For example, the investigator-in-charge learned from the newspaper about a witness who saw the  Morning Dew  and about the reports to the Coast Guard of a boatswain hearing cries from the water.  The problems in coordination that arose during this accident could have been avoided if the Coast Guard, the SCNDR, and local responders had used a system that allowed them to manage a joint SAR operation. Therefore, the Safety Board adopted a recommendation that asks the Coast Guard to implement a program whereby Coast Guard emergency response personnel participate in drills with local agencies within their area of responsibility in order to exercise their role in the incident command structure, and gain experience in using the incident command system.  When reviewing the initial accident investigation coordination, the Board was distressed to learn that the commanding officer of Group Charleston was unaware of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Coast Guard and the State, even though it had been in place since 1984. The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 specified that cooperative agreements between the Coast Guard and each of the states within the district's area of responsibility be in place to foster cooperation between State and Federal governments in reducing deaths, injuries, and property damage from recreational boating accidents. These agreements usually cover such subject areas as law enforcement, public education and training, boating casualty reporting and investigative reports, SAR, aids to navigation, and use of the Coast Guard Auxiliary.  Although the agreement between the Coast Guard and the State of South Carolina had been reviewed in 1994, personnel changes have occurred in both the state agencies and the Coast Guard, and telephone numbers and points of contact may also have changed. Coast Guard Headquarters issued a message to all district commanders in February 1999 directing a review of all existing agreements or MOUs between the districts and other agencies within their areas of responsibility. The guidance, however, did not provide a timeframe for the completion of the reviews, nor did it provide for follow-up periodic review and updating, which is necessary to ensure that the agreements are kept current.  The Board Members have asked staff to draft safety recommendations to the Coast Guard and the Governors of the 50 states to review and revise, within 6 months and at least biannually thereafter, all boating safety agreements between the Coast Guard and the States to ensure that those agreements are coordinated between local Coast Guard authorities and the appropriate agencies within the States and accurately reflect current responsibilities and jurisdictions of each entity in such areas as boating casualty accident investigation and reporting, SAR, and related boating safety issues.  The Safety Board believes that if the commanding officer of Group Charleston had knowledge of the agreement and its provisions, the coordination between the Coast Guard and the SCDNR in the aftermath of the accident may have been significantly improved.  Mr. Chairman, it is noteworthy that the  Morning Dew  investigation did not identify the actual search by Coast Guard boat and helicopter crews as an issue in this accident. Once the SAR was initiated, it proceeded well. But, in order for an SAR to take place, Coast Guard communications and operations personnel must receive, acknowledge, and act upon a distress situation. In the case of the  Morning Dew , this did not occur until after the Coast Guard was notified by the Sullivans Island Police Department that bodies were discovered near the beach 11:15 a.m. on December 29, 1997, some eight hours after the first mayday call from the vessel.  We recognize that over the last few years the Coast Guard has had its budget and personnel significantly reduced, and still maintained its high level of response to distress calls and lives saved. However, we believe the Coast Guard should reexamine its priorities and make the necessary investment in infrastructure and personnel that will help ensure the safety of Americans on our waterways. We believe rapid action in response to our safety recommendations by the Coast Guard will prevent the recurrence similar accidents.  Mr. Chairman that completes my statement and I will be happy to respond to whatever questions the Committee may have.    Speeches & Testimony   NTSB Home  |  News & Events"

Abstra ct  Contemporary terrorists have made public transportation a new theater of operations. For those determined to kill in quantity and willing to kill indiscriminately, public transportation offers an attractive target. Because it is public and used by millions of people daily, there is necessarily little security. Passengers are strangers, promising attackers anonymity. Concentrations of people in contained environments are especially vulnerable to conventional explosives and unconventional weapons and attacks on public transportation, the circulatory systems of urban environments, cause great disruption and alarm, which are the traditional goals of terrorism. In order to effectivel y meet the threat posed by terrorism and other forms of violent crime, it is essential that transportation system operators have a thorough understanding of the security measures employed elsewhere, especially by those transportation entities that have suffered terrorist attacks or that confront high threat levels. This volume reports on the first phase of a continuing research effort carried out by the Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies (IISTPS) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation. It comprises a chronology of attacks on surface transportation systems; four case studies of transportation security measures (in Paris, Atlanta, and New York, and at Amtrak); security surveys of nine additional cities in the United States; and an annotated bibliography of current literature on the topic. 17.

Jenkins  Contemporary terrorists have made public transportation a new theater of operations. Algerian extremists set off bombs on the subways of Paris in 1995 and 1996; the Irish Republican Army has waged a long running terrorist campaign against Britain's passenger trains and London's subways; Palest inian terrorists have carried out suicide bo mbings on Israel's buses; and an individual or a group calling itself ""Sons o f the Gestapo"" derailed a passenger train in Arizona in 1995. Islamic extremists planned to set off car bo mbs in New York's tunnels and bridges in 1993 and in 1997 they plotted suicide bo mbings in New York subways. The nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways by members of the Aum Shinrikyo sect in 1995 raised the specter that terrorists in the future might resort to weapons of mass destruction to which public transportation is uniquely vulnerable. For those determined to kill in quant it y and willing to kill indiscriminately, public transportation offers an ideal target. Precisely because it is public, and used by millio ns of people daily, there is necessarily little securit y wit h no obvious checkpo ints, like those at airports, to inspect passengers and parcels. The passengers are strangers, promising attackers anonymit y and easy escape. Concentrations of people in contained environments are especially vulnerable to convent ional explosives and unconvent io nal weapons. Specifically, attacks on public transportation, the circulatory systems of urban environments, cause great disruption and alarm, which are the tradit ional goals of terroris m. As the accompanying Chronology of Terrorist and Other Significant Attacks on Surface Transportation Systems indicates, terrorist attacks on surface transportation systems have increased over the past 25 years. Two-thirds of these attacks are intended to kill, 35 percent of them have resulted in fatalit ies, and of the fatal attacks, 30 percent invo lve 10 or more deaths. Terrorists pose unique challenges to those responsible for securit y. The nat ion is familiar with the terrorist bombings at the World Trade Center, the Oklaho ma Cit y federal building, and Centennial  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   2  Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  Park in Atlanta, and a number of terrorist bombings have been thwarted by vigilant authorit ies. These incidents indicate that the terrorist threat in the United States is real, although there is no consensus on the nature and magnitude o f that threat. The United States has not experienced on-going terrorist campaigns like those waged by the Irish Republican Army in the United Kingdo m or by various Palest inian extremist groups in Israel. Incidents here have been iso lated and statist ically rare but somet imes of great consequence. Because terrorist threats are not easily quant ifiable, it is difficult to determine the ""right"" level o f securit y. Using cost-benefit analys is as the sole criterion to determine the level of securit y is not very helpful. The risk of death to any individual cit izen fro m terrorism is minuscule, making it difficult to argue for any securit y measure on the grounds that it will save lives. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the perceived burden of securit y is not determined by the number or capabilit ies of the potential attackers, but by the size and number of targets to be defended. Since the threat of terrorism is murky and securit y measures are costly, it is hard to justify the expenditures before an attack. Securit y against terrorism therefore tends to be reactive. Scope of the Work In order to effect ively meet the threat posed by terrorism and other forms of vio lent crime, it is essent ial that transportation system operators have a thorough understanding of the securit y measures emplo yed by other operators and especially by those transportation ent it ies that have suffered terrorist attacks or that confront high levels o f threat. The object ive of this project is the creation of a ""best practices textbook"" describing the most effect ive securit y measures and response procedures. This vo lume reports on the first phase of the effort to define which practices are best. It includes four original case studies commissio ned by the Norman Y. Mineta International Inst itute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies (IISTPS) on behalf o f the U.S. Department of Transportation. The four case studies address transportation securit y measures in Paris, At lanta, New York, and on the Amtrak rail system. The Paris case study focuses on the immediate aftermath of the 1995 terrorist bombing in the St.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  3  Michel Station. Further terrorist bo mbings occurred in France in the fall of 1995 and in December 1996 obliging authorit ies to increase securit y. The At lanta case study focuses on the securit y preparations connected with the 1996 Olympics and the aftermath of the Centennial Park bo mbing, although this bombing was not directed against public transportation. The Amtrak case study focuses on the response to the deliberate derailing of the Sunset Limited in Arizona in November 1995. New York was included because of the size and complexit y of its transportation system and the various incidents and threats that have affected it, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the subsequent plot to blow up bridges and tunnels, and the 1996 explosio n at the Battery Park subway station. As these case studies were being completed, police discovered a terrorist plot to carry out suicide bo mbings on the cit y's subways. Each case study examines three issues:    policies and practices in effect prior to the incident (preincident preparedness); the response to the event or heightened threat environment; and the recovery efforts.  To facilitate comparisons, we have developed a commo n format, which can be used as further case studies are added to the effort. The format allows for a broad interpretation of securit y. It includes:   a descript ion of the transportation system itself; all aspects of exist ing securit y: - threat assessment - securit y organizat ion, personnel, procedures, and training - environmental design - securit y techno logy - emergency communications - the role of the public  crisis management planning;  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   4  Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins     liaison wit h authorit ies; and the immediate response to attacks or threats including: - additional securit y measures, - emergency response, - restoration of services, - lessons learned - problem areas ident ified  Alt hough somewhat examined discussed  the order in which these topics from one case study to another, all to the extent that informat ion is in a widely-disseminated document  are addressed varies of these elements are available and can be .  All o f the case the operating e action reports, authorities, and  studies were conducted with the full cooperation of nt it y and are based on reviews of plans and afterinterviews with co mpany o fficials and public media accounts of events.  During the course of this research, an addit io nal task was added. In 1996, the Federal Transportation Agency (FTA) examined exist ing securit y practices at nine public transportation systems in the United States. The systems included mult i-mode transportation systems, medium and large bus systems, and small and rural bus systems. The reviews were not based on case studies but surveys and they did not focus exclusively on terrorism and other significant vio lent crime but included a broader spectrum of crimes against property (e.g., Objects thrown at vehicles, arson, and hate crimes), crimes against persons (assaults on passengers, attacks on operators or drivers, weapons o ffenses, and ho micides), and dramat ic impact crimes such as bo mb threats and terrorism. We were asked to review and reformat the material co mpiled in the nine surveys so that it could more easily be compared wit h the four case studies. As the informat ion gathered in the surveys did not permit a detailed narrative, we have presented the FTA material in chart form using the same list of key topics used for the case studies. The charts are included in Appendix A. The results of the nine FTA surveys are then co mpared with the four IISTPS case studies in Appendices B, C, and D.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  5  In addit ion to the four case studies and the results of the nine surveys conducted by the FTA, we were able to gather further material from public sources and briefings by Brit ish, Israeli, and Japanese transportation officials, which were particularly relevant given their experience wit h terrorism. However, it is ant icipated that detailed case studies of these experiences will be part of the next phase o f research leading to the ""best practices"" textbook ment ioned earlier. The final phase of the effort will be to present the results to operators at various nat ional and regional symposia. Desirable Attributes of Security Before summarizing the specific securit y measures ident ified in the case studies and surveys, so me of the broader issues that emerged should be identified. First, it is clear that effect ive ""securit y"" includes not just the deterrent and preventive measures that normally co me under the heading of securit y pract ices, but all efforts to mit igate casualt ies, damage, and disrupt ion and to rapidly restore operations after an attack. Given the inherent advantages that terrorists always have, and the inherent vulnerabilit y of public transportation, in most cases the operating ent ity and authorit ies will be react ing to a communicated threat or an actual incident. The point can be illustrated by co mparing commercial aviat ion securit y wit h that of surface transportation. Historically, airlines have been among the favorite targets of terrorism. The extraordinary securit y measures implemented over the years in response to this threat have greatly reduced the incidents of airline hijacking and sabotage, though much remains to be done to increase the level of confidence among the public that terrorists and other criminals bent upon hostage-taking or destruction will not succeed. In many respects, surface transportation offers a tempt ing target that is far more difficult to protect. Commercial aviat ion securit y places great emphasis on deterrence; however, prevent ion is the key element. In contrast, surface transportation securit y may try to deter potential attackers but actual prevent ion is much more difficult. There are too many passengers entering the system at too many locat ions to permit the kind of passenger and luggage screening that protects airliners. Some mit igat ion measures, that is, measures taken to limit  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   6  Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  casualt ies or damage in case of an attack, are possible in aviat ion securit y (e.g., hardening cargo container to reduce the effects of an explo sion), but realist ically, possibilit ies are limited. In surface transportation, mit igat ion can be achieved through the design o f cars and stations and by rapid response to incidents that occur. Restoration of service is not a major issue in aviat ion securit y. When an aircraft is hijacked or destroyed, it is out of action, but the overall disrupt ion to airline travel is minimal. In contrast, restoration of service is often a key issue in surface transportation. Wit h less weight on deterrence and prevent ion and more on the mit igat ion of damages and the restoration of surface transportation, securit y is essent ially react ive. Therefore emergenc y response and crisis management are the crit ical co mponents of surface transportation securit y. The case studies of the St. Michel bo mbing and the derailing of the Sunset Limited bear out this observat ion. The significant costs and the reactive nature of protecting surface transportation systems indicate that security measures should be flexible, that is, they can be increased rapidly during periods of heightened threat and decreased when circumstances permit. The costs of manpower also demand that much o f the work be done with techno logy rather than personnel. Coordination with Authorities Securit y against terrorism requires cooperation and coordination between the private and public sector and between local and nat ional authorit ies. The line between the operating authorit y's securit y cont ingent and the local authorit ies' can vary. Some large operating ent it ies have their own police departments while in other cases local po lice may assume responsibilit y for all but routine securit y functions. The operating ent it y has primary responsibilit y for securit y, immediate response to threats, crisis management planning, and the restoration of operations in case of terrorist attacks. Local authorit ies often share responsibility for securit y or augment the operating entit ies' securit y force when required. Local police also have access to intelligence not ordinarily available to the operating ent it y and may assume responsibilit ies for major criminal invest igat ions, and local civic authorit ies usually assist in the immediate response to threats, crisis planning, and emergency response.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  7  The role of the federal government in securit y against terrorism is an evo lving one. A terrorist attack within the United States is an attack on America and not necessarily just against the specific target. That common bond makes securit y against terrorism a nat ional concern, a part of providing for the common defense. This notion was advanced by the White House Commissio n on Aviat ion Safet y and Securit y and accepted in principle by Congress, although Congress has not always provided the funds requested to augment aviat ion securit y. To what extent this principle can or should be applied to surface transportation remains a question. The nature of the terrorist threat makes it impossible for the federal government to assume the entire burden and the imperat ive of balancing the federal budget makes it unlikely that the government will contribute greatly to ongoing securit y costs. The operating entit y and local authorit ies will bear the larger burden. The federal government, however, may contribute to securit y by sponsoring research and development and by funding the deplo yment of experimental securit y techno logy. Federal agencies play a major role in the co llect ion, analysis, and disseminat ion of intelligence on terrorism and local authorit ies depend on the government for this t ype of informat ion. The federal government may also take over the task of invest igat ing terrorist threats or crimes, assist in emergency response, and provide specialized equipment and material to deal with more exotic threats such as the use of chemical weapons. The relat ionship between the transportation entit y and the local or state authorities on securit y issues poses two questions. First, should the federal government set securit y standards for surface transportation as it now does for commercial aviat ion? There is no indicat ion that operating ent it ies would welco me federal regulation in the securit y area, although federally-sponsored research leading to the ident ification o f a textbook on ""best practices"" may, in a lit igious societ y like America, have the effect of establishing minimum securit y standards. Second, should the federal government augment securit y in extraordinary circumstances, for example, the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction? The sheer size of this problem can  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   8  Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  make federal assistance almo st inevitable and there are precedents, like the carefully-crafted preparations for the Olymp ics in At lanta, but there are const itutional issues to be considered. Dedicated Security Personnel The case studies and surveys indicate that all of the larger operating ent it ies examined have dedicated security forces comprised of co mpany personnel, their own police departments, or dedicated bureaus o f local po lice departments. Smaller systems depend more heavily on whatever protection can be provided by local po lice. The police departments of either kind conduct visible patrols as well as undercover surveillance. A major terrorism threat or attack will require the combined capabilities o f both the operating ent it y's securit y force and the local authorit ies. Security Technology Alo ng with personal radios and centralized electronic control centers, closed-circuit televisio n (CCTV) is increasingly being used as a deterrent to crime in public areas and to facilitate investigat ions. Intrusion sensors and alarms monitored by control centers are in place at the larger transportation systems. Techno logy is also being deplo yed by a number of operators to provide the accurate location of all trains, buses, and securit y personnel at all t imes. In so me cases, buses are being equipped with global posit ioning systems (GPS) to quickly pinpo int the precise location of any vehicle invo lved in an incident. Advance Planning The case studies show that advance planning is essent ial to ensure a coordinated and effective response to a threat or attack. This is perhaps best illustrated in the case o f the RATP's (Rgie Autonome des Transports Parisiens) highly efficient response to the St. Michel bo mbing. Frequent jo int exercises invo lving all concerned agencies identify potential problems in advance and ensure readiness. Environmental Design The case studies ident ify a number of examples of environmental design to facilitate surveillance, increase phys ical securit y, eliminate potential hiding places (e.g., in trash cans and under  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  9  seats), reduce sources of fragmentation (bo mb resistant trash containers), combustible materials, and materials that produce toxic fumes. Environmental design can also facilitate emergency evacuat ion and increase or prevent ventilat ion. Communications The four systems examined in the case studies all have mult i-mode communicat ions systems to ensure communicat ions during routine operations and crisis situat ions. These systems include mult iple radio networks, cellular telephones, landlines, and public address systems. Issues that arise include the difficult ies of radio use underground, compatibilit y of co mmunicat ions equipment and frequencies wit h local law enforcement, communications procedures to ensure coordinat ion with other agencies, standardized language to eliminate misunderstandings that arise fro m codes or technical jargon, and the need for mult i-lingual broadcasts on public address systems. Training All o f the operating entit ies reviewed in the case studies placed great emphasis on training. Both regular emplo yees and securit y staff are seen as part of the securit y and emergency response team and are trained to carry out their roles. Regular drills, tabletop exercises, no-notice responses, and full-scale simulat ions are regularly conducted to ensure readiness. Public Involvement Several o f the transportation systems examined have decided to make the public part of their overall securit y effort by posting signs and broadcasting warnings that urge patrons not to leave their luggage or parcels unattended and to immediately not ify the authorities of unattended or suspicious parcels. Public invo lvement is highest in locat ions where there is a continuing terrorist threat (the United Kingdo m and Israel). Where the terrorist threat is not immediate, such warnings risk creat ing a fearful at mosphere and provoking a high vo lume of false alarms. Generally, however, the trend appears to be in the direct ion of public invo lvement.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   10  Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  Augmented Security The easiest and fastest way to augment securit y fo llowing a terrorist attack, or in times of heightened threat, is to increase the visible presence of securit y personnel. Somet imes this is necessary if only to reassure a frightened public that something is being done. Since the number of co mpany securit y personnel ma y be limited, addit ional personnel must come fro m local and natio nal authorities. In an extreme case, France, faced with a cont inuing terrorist bo mbing campaign, deplo yed 37,000 military personnel and po lice to securit y funct ions, including 5,000 soldiers to patrol trains, stations, bus terminals, and airports in Paris. Mutual aid agreements among departments can augment police strength for short periods during emergencies. Atlanta's Metropolitan At lanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), however, had disappo int ing results in the response to the agreements it had negotiated prior to the Olympics. To reiterate, advance planning is essent ial. Restoration of Services When asked what issues are paramount in responding to terrorist threats or attacks, surface transportation managers ident ified maintenance or the restoration of operations. This is hardly surprising since operations are their primary responsibilit y and their capacit y to prevent casualt ies caused by terrorist attacks is limited. Shutting down vital public transportation to avoid potential future attacks makes as little sense as grounding all commercial airliners in order to prevent hijacking or sabotage. The restoration and maintenance of operations requires the agency to quickly reduce the disrupt ions caused by bo mb threats or explo sions, keep the trains and buses moving during the crisis, rapidly remo ve of damaged equipment, make repairs immediately, and establish alternat ive routes as soon as possible. The Paris case study provides a dramat ic example of rapid response to a major terrorist incident. At times the operating agencies' desire to keep transportation moving is in conflict with local authorit ies' need to conduct crime scene invest igat ions. In these cases the transportation management must cooperate with the outside authorities in order to achieve their goals, even though this may invo lve polit ical issues.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  11  Crisis Communications Communicat ion during a crisis is an area often overlooked or inadequately addressed in crisis management plans. Terrorism is calculated to create an atmosphere of fear and alarm and it often works. Moreover, terrorist attacks on transportation systems may result in large-scale casualt ies which heighten public alarm and impose addit ional demands fro m the vict ims and their relat ives. Passengers must be assured that travel is safe or at the least, the threat or the event must not be exaggerated. In the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack there is a tremendous demand for news in general and for specific informat ion about the ident it y and condit ion of the vict ims. Informing and supporting anxious relat ives of actual and potential vict ims requires a major effort, which, in turn, requires advance planning. Unlike airline disasters, terrorist attacks on local transportation systems can bring a large number of relat ives and friends to the site of the incident itself, creating a phys ical problem as well as increasing traffic on the already busy co mmunicat ions systems. Few transportation agencies or associated police forces or local authorit ies are able to adequately cope with the demands of public informat io n and vict im support. The Paris case study offers the best example, but even here, minor problems were ident ified among the lessons learned fro m the St. Michel bo mbing. Inter-city Rail vs. Transit In addit ion to reviewing the securit y practices of the four systems included in the case studies, we were especially interested in comparing the securit y practices and emergency response procedures of the three urban transit systems (Paris, At lanta, and New York) with those of Amtrak. As the chrono logy shows, apart fro m ambushes in conflict zones, the most lethal episodes in transit systems are the result of bo mbs carried on board by terrorists posing as passengers. Transit systems have high vo lumes of passengers and many access points, creating numerous potential targets and making surveillance o f passengers more difficult. Terrorists have detonated bombs on inter-cit y trains but advance bookings would theoretically permit so me securit y measures. Passenger ident it y verificat ion upon ticket purchase or boarding, even passenger and luggage screening, are possible but not  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   12  Executive Summary  Brian M. Jenkins  currently ut ilized by any rail system, and they would probably be considered extreme and unwarranted measures without an immediate and obvious threat. As the accompanying chronology of terrorist attacks shows, long distance rail systems face a greater threat from derailment caused by sabotage of the rails themselves. Transit systems have an advantage here result ing from the high vo lume of traffic, which gives saboteurs only brief intervals between trains in which to sabotage the rails or plant explosives. Alt hough techno logy is in place to alert drivers to breaks in the rails ahead o f the train, this techno logy can be circumvented as was seen in the derailment of the Sunset Limited. Unfortunately, these systems cannot detect the presence of explosives which can be detonated as a train approaches. The physical protection of lo ng lines is inherent ly difficult and while increased visual surveillance is possible, it would be very costly. Different types of emergencies require different responses. Urban transit systems have the advantage of being located in areas where company personnel, medics, and police can be rapidly mo bilized. By contrast, when an emergency occurs in a remote area, like the derailing of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, it may take company personnel hours to reach the scene and the primary response effort depends on local authorit ies. Different situations call for different approaches to emergency response training. Operators of transit systems can design training for their own emplo yees and for dedicated police forces which can be brought to remote locations as reinforcements. Operators of inter-city rail systems will need to train personnel in local jurisdict ions alo ng the right of way. Future case studies no doubt will ident ify addit io nal differences. However, it should be noted that while it is easy to draw sharp dist inct ions between an urban system like At lanta's MARTA and an inter-cit y carrier like Amtrak, large metropolitan systems may contain elements of both, thus requiring an appropriate mixture of securit y and emergency response and planning approaches. For this reason, we do not believe that it would be useful to separate the analysis o f securit y measures for transit systems fro m those of inter-cit y rail.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   The Paris Subwa y System  Brian M. Jenkins  13  THE PARIS SUBWAY SYSTEM The Paris Subway Bombing at St. Michel by Brian M. Jenkins  The terrorist bombing of the St. Michel train station of the RER Line B in Paris on July 25, 1995 provides an excellent insight into the securit y and emergency response procedures of the cit y's transportation system. This case study, created by the Paris authorit ies to deal with such crises, examines the advance preparations, the immediate response, and the lessons learned from the episode. It is based upon media accounts and after-act ion reporting by the regional authorit y, the RATP, the suburban train syst em. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM The Paris metropolitan area or ""commuter zone"", an area of 70 to 100 square kilo meters around the center of the cit y, contains 11 millio n inhabitants. Public transportation services represent 30.5 percent of all traffic in Paris. Rgie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP) The Rgie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (RATP) was created in 1948 to manage and operate the Rseau Express Rgional (RER), the Metro, the bus and the tramway system. This system includes 96 percent of the public transportation in Paris and carries 80 percent of the traffic. The French National Railroad, Socit Nationale des Chemins de Fer Franais (SNCF), carries 16 percent of the traffic in the Paris area. The RATP reports direct ly to the Syndicat des Transports Parisiens (STP), a ho lding company. The system is heavily subsidized by the state with only 40 percent of its costs covered by t icket sales. It carries 2.1 billio n passengers annually. The RATP has nearly 40,000 emplo yees: 25,000 in rail transport services, 12,000 in bus transportation services, 11,000 in maintenance, and 200 in commercial and administration services. Rseau Express Rgional (RER) The RER is the commuter train network for suburban subway wit hin the cit y. It operates 978 coaches and through a total of 65 stations, so me of which it shares trains make fewer stops than Metro trains and thus offer Paris and an express engines on four lines wit h the Metro. RER faster service. Only a  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   14  The Paris Subway System Brian M. Jenkins  portion of this network is managed by the RATP. The other part is managed by the SNCF and most tickets are interchangeable between the two systems. Service usually runs fro m 5:30 a. m. to 12:15 a.m. Metro The Metro operates 3500 coaches and electric engines on 201 kilo meters of track with 368 stations on 15 lines, ident ified by the final dest inat ion or by numbers. It was designed by Hector Guimard and engineered by Fulgence Bienvenue for a July 19, 1900 opening. The Metro runs daily fro m 5:30 a.m. to 12:45 a.m. Trains arrive every three to five minutes, rising to a frequency of 95 seconds between trains during rush hours. Assessment of the Threat The efficient response after the bombing incident indicates extensive prior planning, which is not surprising given the long history of terrorist activit y in France. During the war in Algeria in the late 1950s and early 1960s, both those fighting for Algeria's independence and those determined to keep Algeria French carried their terrorist campaigns to the French mainland. From the late 1960s on, terrorists representing various countries and groups in the Middle East seized hostages, carried out assassinatio ns, and set off bo mbs in the French capital. The notorious terrorist Carlos conducted a bombing campaign in France in the early 1980s which included detonating a bomb planted in a train coach that killed several people. In the mid-1980s, ""Action Directe"", a small group of left-wing fanatics, carried out a number of assassinat ions and bo mbings in Paris. In 1986, Middle Eastern terrorists set off 12 bo mbs in public locat ions around Paris in a campaign of terror aimed at forcing the French government to release a number of terrorists held in prison. In all, between 1970 and 1995, the date of the St. Michel bo mbing, terrorists had attacked surface transportation systems in France no less than 22 times. Wit h the renewed civil war in Algeria, which began in 1991, came the threat of new terrorist campaigns in France. Backed by the French government, the Algerian government securit y forces were fight ing co mbatants represent ing outlawed Islamic elements. Only a short time before the bombing at St. Michel, French authorities had rounded up more than a hundred suspects in an effort to thwart the possibilit y of more terrorist attacks. Thus, the perception of the terrorist threat at the time of the attack was very high and intelligence activit ies were intense. In France, intelligence co llect ion and threat analysis are conducted by the country's intelligence services with appropriate warnings passed on to the rail operators. Coordination between government authorit ies and state-owned companies is ordinarily very clo se.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   The Paris Subwa y System  Brian M. Jenkins  15  Security Organization and Personnel Normally, trains and addit ional awareness 700 members of the RATP securit y force patrol the RER and Metro stations; these are RATP emplo yees. Four hundred police provide securit y. Because of France's history of terrorist activit y, public and tolerance of securit y measures are high.  Security Plans The RATP has prepared plans that address various aspects of terrorism including bo mb threats and reports of suspicious objects, as well as actual bo mbings and other terrorist tactics. In the tense weeks fo llowing the St. Michel bo mbing, any threat or report brought about extremely rapid intervent ion by police and milit ary units to evacuate the station, conduct a search, and restore normal operations. It is virtually certain that the RATP and French government authorit ies have planned for more exotic terrorist threats especially in the wake of the chemical attack on Tokyo's subways but the details of these plans are not known. Nor is it known whether exist ing securit y plans call for increases to predefined levels of securit y. The terrorist bo mbing campaign which began with the attack at St. Michel led to a special securit y effort called operation ""Vigipirate."" As of this writ ing, ""Vigipirate,"" described later, continues. Reports provided by the RATP and discussio n with the French authorit ies indicate that there are also a variet y of responses planned to deal with the consequences of terrorist attacks including evacuation, medical response, and crisis co mmunicat ions. Security Technology Exist ing securit y techno logy includes physical barriers to protect vital systems, intrusion alarms, and expanding use of closed-circuit televisio n (CCTV) surveillance with an increasing capabilit y to record images for later investigat ion and forensic purposes. Radio posit ioning systems are in place to mo nitor RATP securit y measures, police vehicles, and personnel in Metro and RER tunnels. Closed-circuit TV has been used in the system for many years. In 1991, the RATP began to increase its abilit y to remotely monitor the system from its safet y and securit y headquarters. As of 1996 there were 4,000 televisio n cameras in place monitoring escalators, enabling drivers to check passengers boarding trains, and co mmitted to other securit y applicat ions. The video system emplo ys very sophist icated software that combines the televisio n system with other types o f data input and enables the operators to instant ly summo n the image fro m any one o f the thousands of cameras. Installation o f  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   16  The Paris Subway System Brian M. Jenkins  addit ional cameras is continuing at Metro and RER stations. A new ""Headquarters 2000"" will integrate the alarm system wit h the CCTV network to better coordinate the activit ies of po lice and the RATP securit y staff. Personnel on foot in the tunnels are also being equipped wit h locating devices that use the exist ing radio infrastructure. These devices are integrated with the vehicle locating system to provide a graphic display o f the posit ion of all securit y and safet y elements connected with the system. In addit ion, alarms are available for passenger use to temporarily cut power in case o f emergencies. Environmental Design and Construction Features Drawing lessons fro m fires in the Paris Metro and other urban rail systems, the RATP has pursued an act ive program aimed at reducing fire hazards. Measures include the eliminat ion of all highly combust ible materials and potential sources of toxic fumes from underground stations, the installat ion of fire doors and blinds, fire detection devices, vent ilat ion shafts, and addit ional reversible fans to provide rapid smoke evacuat ion. Combust ible materials and sources of toxic fumes have also been replaced on the cars. The fire hazard reduction efforts apparently paid off. In the St. Michel bombing, although the explo sion generated very high temperatures, there was no subsequent fire. In response to the bombing campaign, which cont inued after the attack at the St. Michel station, trash bins were sealed. In February 1997, the RATP began installing devices on all RER cars that prevent people from placing bags or packages under the seats. These devices eventually will be installed under 80,000 seats. A number of subway entrances were also sealed. Communications The RATP has two radio networks. The surface radio network covers the cit y and suburbs of Paris. A working channel is available for operation in open network in both a collect ive mode and a local mode which is divided into five zones. A separate channel allows non-urgent service co mmunicat ions. The drivers of 100 vehicles and 650 safet y staff all have radios. The underground radio network covers Metro stations and those in the central sect ion of the RER. That the radios do not work in tunnels is a recognized weakness. In addit ion to the radio networks, ther stations and at control posts, with direct Fire Brigade. There are also phones for system that displays the locat ion of the system. e are dedicated phone lines in the lines to outside services such as the passenger use connected to an alarm caller, and there is a public address  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   The Paris Subwa y System  Brian M. Jenkins  17  Training Training is extensive. Each emplo yee has a designated role in an emergency and exercises are regularly conducted by the Paris Fire Brigade (BSPP) in the RER and Metro in which RATP personnel part icipate, especially the ""Ro lling Stock Lift ing Team."" Coordinat ion is facilitated by the fact that many members of the RATP safet y team are former firemen. In addit ion, the RATP conducts 10 to 12 exercises a year invo lving all management and staff. Some of these are conducted during normal service, others are conducted at night when the system is shut down. At least once a year there is a ""ma jor exercise"" which simulates an explosio n, fire, or collis io n at a station or in a tunnel. THE INCIDENT At approximately 5:30 p.m., in the middle of the evening rush hour on July 25, 1995, a powerful terrorist bomb exploded at the front of the sixth car of an RER train as it was nearing its normal stopping posit ion in the St. MichelNotre Dame Station in Paris. Seven persons died and more than 80 persons were injured in the blast, 14 of them crit ically. The explosio n caused extensive damage to one coach but only minor damage to the station. Operating according to previously-rehearsed contingency plans, RER emplo yees, Paris firemen, and medical personnel remo ved the dead and wounded while police cordoned off the area and conducted an on-scene investigat ion. The damaged car was sufficient ly repaired to allow it to be pulled to another area while other crews repaired minor damage and cleaned the station. Trains were back on their normal routes and schedules the next morning. Emergency Response Upon notificat ion of the explo sio n at St. Michel, three plans of act ion were promptly init iated. The first was the Emergency Control Plan applicable to serious accidents in the Metro and RER. This plan provides procedures for the intervent ion of the Fire Brigade and RATP on the scene and at the RATP headquarters. It creates a combined Fire Brigade-RATP hierarchy wit h jo int teams at the operational level. This provides firemen with RATP interlocutors who are knowledgeable about the layout of the installat ion. It also provides the means by which informat ion and requests can easily be transmitted between the Fire Brigade and the RATP. This plan interfaces wit h Plan Rouge which is implemented when, whatever the cause, the number of vict ims reaches ten. Plan Rouge mobilizes the Fire Brigade and Civil Defense Brigades. Its counterpart is Plan Blanc, which mobilizes the emergency medical services and local hospitals.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   18  The Paris Subway System Brian M. Jenkins  The second plan init iated after the explo sion was the Crisis Co mmunicat ions Plan. This plan provides RATP management with procedures for setting up a crisis center and for activat ing a telephone informat ion service, and for determining company po licy for public co mmunicat ions. The third plan covers measures to be taken in the event of terrorist attacks. It is concerned primarily wit h securit y and therefore remains confidential. All of these plans are regularly reviewed and rehearsed. (See the Training section of this study.) CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION Alt hough the bo mb caused only superficial damage to the station itself, the explo sion destroyed a portion of the overhead contact line and damaged the signal systems. Electrical arcs fro m the damaged power line, in turn, disrupted the communicat ion system. Fortunately, the bo mb caused no subsequent fire to delay or complicate rescue operations and restoration of service. In addit ion to the removal of the dead and injured, which was completed within three hours after the blast, the biggest problem was the removal o f the damaged coach. The force of the explo sio n caused the sides and roof of the car where the bo mb exploded to bulge out making it too large to pull through the tunnel. The duty desk of the Electrical Systems and Equipment Department received notice of the explosio n within 20 minutes and prompt ly dispatched personnel to survey electrical and signaling equipment and assess damage to the station. (See the Appendix of this case study for a Chronology of the response.) The Rolling Stock Lift ing Team responded rapidly, although in a subsequent review, it was noted that the ""working bus,"" a mobile tool-shed and workshop, arrived at the scene so mewhat late. Init ial efforts focused on the rescue of the vict ims and the police invest igat ion of the crime. Wit hin five hours, work crews were able to begin replacing the overhead contact line. The Rolling Stock Lift ing Team removed blown-out doors and bent the bulged metal in sufficient ly to permit the damaged car to be towed through the tunnels. Police finished their on-scene investigation within six hours and permitted the damaged car to be towed to another locat ion where investigative activit ies could be continued wit hout interrupting train service. The explosio n had interrupted service on the one RER line but by shift ing trains to alternate tracks and advising passengers to use the Metro lines, the RATP was able to keep moving passengers.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   The Paris Subwa y System  Brian M. Jenkins  19  Minor repairs and cleaning at the St. Michel Station were completed during the night permitting the RER to restore normal service the next morning, all things considered, a remarkable achievement! However, in the weeks fo llo wing the explosio n, passenger service was frequent ly disrupted by bo mb alerts and the discovery o f suspicious objects. At their peak, these interruptions occurred at the rate of 50 a week. Public Relations In the St. Michel bombing, a local contact center was set up at a caf near the entrance to the station. This provided a site that was easy for people to find, near the scene of the disaster, yet far enough away fro m the station to prevent its act ivit ies fro m interfering wit h rescue efforts. The center, which became operational wit hin 15 minutes of the explosio n, was manned by six regular RER emplo yees plus two persons fro m the RER's legal department and two government social workers. The contact center offered information and assistance to family members of vict ims. People at the scene could also use the center to call their ho mes to provide worried families with informat ion. Over 1,000 requests for informat ion were handled on the spot; in addit ion, 500 people were later called back by the center as informat ion on the vict ims became available. The contact center was closed at 11:00 p.m., five and a half hours after the bombing, but the RER continued to provide informat ion updates from its headquarters. In addit ion to this practical assistance, the RER's Public Relat ions Department also managed media inquiries and provided cont inuous informat ion to RER and Metro passengers and emplo yees. Augmented Security Authorities correctly suspected that Algerian terrorists had carried out the bo mbing. The attack was part of an ongoing bloody civil war in which foes of the Algerian government sought to punish France for its support of the regime. Since bo mbings in previous years had been part of terrorist campaigns, most notably in 1986 when Middle Eastern terrorists carried out 12 bombings in Paris and the surrounding area, it was prudent to expect further attacks. Immediate measures including sealing all 8,000 trash containers in the RER and Metro stations to deny terrorists easy hiding places for bo mbs. Both overt and covert surveillance were increased and posters were put up urging public cooperation. Passengers were requested to carefully mind their parcels, cooperate with searches, and alert authorit ies to suspicious objects. The RATP's 700-person securit y cont ingent was reinforced by an addit ional 3,000 agents. They coordinated their act ivit ies with police and later with the French military. As a further measure, 50 Metro  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   20  The Paris Subway System Brian M. Jenkins  and RER entrances and exits were closed for securit y reasons. Addit ional securit y measures were implemented as terrorists set off more bo mbs, the next one only 23 days after the St. Michel bo mbing. Fo llowing a third bo mb found on a rail line between Paris and Lyo n on August 26, 1996, police began a large scale round-up of suspects in southeast France. After a bomb exploded in front of a school near Lyon, the seventh bo mb in the terrorist campaign, the government init iated operation ""Vigipirate,"" which mo bilized 37,000 soldiers and po lice, stepped up securit y on France's frontiers and around likely targets of terrorism wit hin the country. In Paris, 5,000 soldiers and addit io nal po licemen were mobilized to patrol the cit y's regular train stations, Metro and RER trains and stations, bus terminals, airports, commercial malls, government buildings, schools, power plants, waterworks, telecommunications facilit ies, and other potential terrorist targets. Ident ity checks were stepped up. All public gatherings were required to have government authorizat ion and approved securit y plans. Public restrooms were closed and thousands of public garbage cans were sealed or removed. The extraordinary securit y measures appeared to have so me effect fro m the very beginning. The first bomb had been detonated in a train coach. The second bo mb went off on August 17 at the entrance to a Metro station. After the second bo mbing, no further bo mbs were detonated on trains or in stations, although a third bo mb was found on the track of the high-speed train (TGV) that runs between Paris and Lyo n, a less risky lo cation for a bomber. After that, terrorists shifted their targets to outdoor markets, public restrooms, and a school. Operation Vigipirate appeared to have been successful and securit y measures were relaxed so mewhat until December 3, 1996 when, 15 months after the previous bo mbing, another bomb exploded in the RER station at Port Royal in Paris. This resulted in a renewed securit y effort. As of May 1997, Vigipirate continued. LESSONS LEARNED While RATP management and emplo yees and government agencies responded rapidly and efficient ly, which is a testimo ny to extensive prior planning and training, inevitably so me problems arose. These were ident ified in a candid after-action report.   There were some delays in the init ial co mmunicat ion within the RATP. Local control centers were not properly notified that a family contact unit and toll-free telephone number had been established.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   The Paris Subwa y System  Brian M. Jenkins  21     It was not clear during the crisis, who (government or RATP) starts what actions with regard to informing the public. The RATP had a problem getting information from the scene of the explo sion in the underground station to others on the outside at street level. Some RATP staff invo lved in emergency assistance were unable to reach the scene due to strict police surveillance. In the future, some RATP managers will be deplo yed at the scene to serve as contacts with the police. Evacuat ion broadcasts in French should also have been broadcast in English. Radio communicat ions were poor owing in part to damage caused by the explo sion. Disclosure of information to the families was incomplete because the dead had not been ident ified, a problem in all disasters.        While organizat ional problems revealed during the incident cannot be ignored, reaction to the bombing was fast and effect ive. The RATP has a history of dealing wit h terrorism so plans were in place and personnel were prepared. Remarkably, just twelve hours after the explo sion, regular train service was restored and the terrorists' goal, to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and turmoil, was denied. The experience of the St Michel bo mbing proves that planning and training pay off.  Norman Y.

Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Amtrak  James Graebner  23  AMTRAK The Derailment of Sunset Limited by James Graebner Amtrak's Sunset Limited was derailed early on the morning of Monday, October 9, 1995 at Hyder, a desolate spot in the Arizo na desert. This event provides an insight into the securit y and emergency response capabilit ies of Amtrak. This case study demonstrates the vulnerabilit y o f rail systems to sabotage. It examines the preparations invo lved in detecting and counteracting such incidents, and in emergency response, and it examines the lessons learned fro m the episode. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM Inter-cit y rail passenger transportation in the United States dates back over 150 years. Init ially provided by the privately-owned railroads, these services fell vict im to the post World War II growth in private automobile travel and, to a lesser extent, of commercial air transport. The result has been the decline in passenger vo lumes and an emphasis on freight transport services. In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) as a quasi-public ent it y to provide cont inued national rail passenger service. Trains and routes with long histories, which might have disappeared, continue to operate under federal management. Init ially, Amtrak's equipment was a mixture of second-hand cars and loco motives purchased from the railroads. Although generally built to commo n standards as regards strength, clearances, and other regulatory norms established by the Associat ion of American Railroads and the Interstate Commerce Co mmissio n, there were many variat ions dictated by the operating condit ions of the individual carriers. By the time of the Sunset inc ident, Amtrak had replaced most of its old equipment and had developed and applied commo n standards to its fleet. In 1995, Amtrak operated approximately 220 inter-cit y trains over so me 24,000 miles of track in 45 states. However, with the except ion of certain corridors (notably between New York and Washington, and between Los Angeles and San Diego), traffic densit y was generally limited to one train per day in each direct ion. The passenger trains share tracks with freight trains operated by the railroads which owned and maintained the tracks in most cases. In particular, the tracks over which the Sunset runs belo ng to the  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   24  Amtrak - James Graebner  Southern Pacific Railroad which has since merged with the Unio n Pacific Railroad. Security Organization and Personnel When Congress created Amtrak, it recognized the need for a dedicated police force to protect the passengers, emplo yees, and phys ical assets of the system within its operational environment. Statutory authorit y for the Amtrak Police Department is provided under Section 104.305.45 of the United States Code 545J. Under this authorit y, Amtrak spends in excess of $24,500,000 per year to assure the securit y of its passengers. Approximately 18 millio n do llars of this mo ney are allocated to Amtrak's uniformed police divisio n, and so me two millio n do llars to criminal invest igat ions. The corporate budget also supports the Office of Amtrak's Inspector General. Amtrak's 346 police officers are assigned to 28 reporting locations throughout the United States. The vast majorit y, over 82%, are assigned to the intensely populated and high service frequency line fro m Boston, Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. This territory enco mpasses so me 621 miles of railroad which Amtrak both owns and operates. It also accounts for a large proportion of the total ridership and, conco mitantly, a large proportion of the total trains operated. Outside of the Northeast Corridor on the remaining 23,000 miles of track comprising its routes, Amtrak maintains contractual agreements with freight railroads to maintain tracks and to allow for passenger service. Amtrak also contracts with freight railroads for securit y through these operating agreements. For example, the tracks on which the Sunset derailment occurred are covered by an operating agreement with the Southern Pacific Railroad (now merged wit h the Unio n Pacific Railroad). A total of eight railroademplo yed po lice officers assigned throughout the State of Arizona provide coverage as required. It is important to place this level of coverage in perspective. There are approximately 2,000 railroad special agents and police officers throughout the United States. Including the 24,000 miles of track over which Amtrak service is provided, the railroad network totals about 111,000 miles. Statist ically this means that there is about one person for each 55 miles of track. This average is quite mis leading, however, since coverage is naturally more concentrated in locat ions where vandalis m, the most commo n crime affecting railroads, occurs most frequent ly. In the sparsely populated areas of the southwest, such as the area of the Sunset derailment, coverage is necessarily thinner. Nationwide, the Associat ion of American Railroads statist ics for 1994 reported a total of 12,280 incidents of vandalis m. This figure covers only  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Amtrak  James Graebner  25  about 61% of the railroad network, since many o f the nat ion's smaller railroads do not capture or centrally report crime informat ion. Signal vandalism accounted for roughly 3,000 of these offenses, while 154 were reported in the category ""vandalism result ing in derailment."" It is important to note that, for 1994, none of the vandalis m derailments invo lved passenger trains. What these figures make clear is that there is a tremendous dependence on federal, state, county, municipal, and other law enforcement agencies to protect the country's rail infrastructure. Security Plans Materials provided by Amtrak and discussio n wit h the authorit ies indicate that there are also a variety o f response plans to deal with the consequences o f crises that may be caused by terrorist attacks. For reasons of ongoing securit y further details cannot be published. Security Technology Clearly, assu at law, these necessary to could have measures. ming the perpetrators were aware of the potential legal sanct ions were not a sufficient deterrent to their act ivit ies. Therefore, it is examine whether the railroad infrastructure and/or the train itself been subjected to more intensive and extensive preventative  Whereas technological developments such as Glo bal Posit ioning Systems (GPS), impact-crumple zones on railcars, and target hardening techniques can enhance the system's securit y and safet y, litt le if anyt hing can be done to safeguard the system's rail tracks fro m sabotage. Remote and desolate countryside areas where trains pass over tracks infrequent ly remain the system's ""Achilles heel."" Communications Amtrak's trains are served by a radio network with links between all its trains and their nearest dispatch centers. All drivers have radios and cellular phones serve as backup co mmunicat ions.

In addition to these full-scale exercises, numerous table-top exercises are conducted every year.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   26  Amtrak - James Graebner  THE INCIDENT The ill-fated Sunset's journey originated in New Orleans. Normally it would have started in Florida, but a severe hurricane threat had caused annulment of the operations east of the Crescent Cit y, Florida. Sunset therefore had proceeded without incident to San Antonio, where three cars fro m a connecting Chicago train were added. The train left San Antonio at approximately 11:30 p. m. on Saturday, October 7. It was about an hour late leaving El Paso and about two hours late arriving in Phoenix on Sunday night. On leaving Phoenix, the train consisted of two locomotives and 12 cars. It carried 248 passengers and a crew of 20 Amtrak emplo yees. It was a clear moonlit night as the Sunset traveled along the single-track Southern Pacific rails at about 50 mph through the desert of western Arizona. About 59 miles southwest of Phoenix, on the Gila Subdivis io n of the Phoenix line, the train derailed. Sixt y-five passengers were injured in the derailment. One Amtrak emplo yee, Mitchell Bates, age 58, asleep in a top bunk, was thrown to the floor and killed when his car plunged into the river. The cause of the derailment was almost immediately ident ified as sabotage by a hitherto unknown terrorist group, the ""Sons of Gestapo."" Two notes were found at the scene, containing references to ""Ruby Ridge"" and ""Waco,"" both incidents invo lving gun battles between armed groups and the US government. There had been no advance warning o f the derailment. The saboteurs committed the crime by remo ving 29 spikes from the rails. Nuts and bo lts were removed fro m the rail jo ints which held the sect ions of rail together, and the jo int bars that link the rails together were removed. A wire was spliced to the bond wire of the signal system so that the block signal observed by the engineer would displa y a ""green"" light, authorizing the train to proceed at maximum allowable speed. After the wire had been spliced, the loosened 39 foot section of rail was moved inward, causing the track to be out of gauge. The rail was then re-spiked so that it would not be forced back in gauge by the weight of the train as it passed over it. The location of the sabotage, atop a 30 foot high trestle and so me 18 miles fro m a paved road, appeared to have been chosen to cause maximum damage, thwart discovery, and hamper any rescue efforts. In the derailment, however, while both locomotives and eight of the twelve cars derailed, the basic structure of both cars and loco motives remained intact. The cars did not telescope and in general the passenger space was not encroached upon. Similarly, both engines remained upright and were not severely damaged. There was no fire or release of noxious gases. Passengers were able to release  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Amtrak  James Graebner  27  the emergency window hatches fro m inside the cars, and init ial self-rescue activit ies were underway wit hin minutes of the derailment The regulatory design standards and safet y devices required for the track, the signal system, and the rolling stock were all in place and working properly. These devices would have prevented an accidental derailment due to a broken rail or rail jo int. However, because o f the deliberate work of the saboteurs in by-passing the signal fail-safe system to give a false indicat ion, the derailment occurred. This resulted in damage to Amtrak equipment of $2,979,000, or about the cost of one new railroad passenger car. Emergency response Immediately fo llowing the incident, police and rescue workers were dispatched to the scene. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Department was the first law enforcement agency to arrive. In all, over 50 deputies and vo lunteers assisted, in addit io n to many o f the uninjured passengers and crew members. Thirt y-five ambulances responded from Maricopa County and numerous surrounding communit ies. Helicopters from Maricopa County, the Arizona Department of Public Safet y, the National Guard and Air Force's Air Evac transported the injured. Firefighters brought in vehicles with ladders, which were essent ial in getting people off the tops of cars. A medical command post was established about six miles away fro m the site. In all, about 70 passengers and the crew were evacuated from the sit e by helicopter. The quest ion must be asked: ""Once the incident had occurred, was the response as prompt and sufficient as could have been reasonably expected?"" According to one passenger aboard the train, the first rescue helicopter arrived at the scene 45 minutes after the derailment, and wit hin 15 minutes thereafter rescue personnel ""really started to converge."" Considering the remoteness of the site, such rapid response is noteworthy. Two more medical helicopters, the Maricopa County sheriff's deputy, other police and vo lunteer fireman all responded rapidly. Passengers and crew assisted at the scene. The evacuat ion of the injured was completed in approximately four hours. The Red Cross mo bilized a center in Phoenix, to which the remaining passengers were transported. In short, the response was rapid, thorough and organized. Perhaps the best summat ion was provided by the previously quoted passenger, who wrote: My lasting memories of the Sunset Limited tragedy will always focus on the way passengers, Amtrak emplo yees, and rescue personnel reacted after the crash. You should have seen the way everyo ne pulled together during the first hour, and the dedicat ion and  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   28  Amtrak - James Graebner  professio nalis m o f our rescuers. I was proud to have been associated with such decent and caring people. While the rescue of passengers and crew was clearly the highest priorit y, law enforcement also responded prompt ly. Wit hin hours the site was sealed and a nine-mile perimeter established. FBI evidence teams were combing the area within eight hours. Aerial photographs were taken before the four undamaged cars were moved. Federal Railroad Administration inspectors and the National Transportation Safet y Board invest igat ion team arrived at the scene promptly. In all, the response to the derailment appears to have been adequate, prompt, and efficient ly executed. Assessment of the Incident Prior to the derailment, Amtrak received no specific threats against the railroad or Sunset Limited nor was any form o f warning given. In this sect ion, analys is of the Sunset derailment is considered from three aspects. First, could the incident reasonably have been prevented? Secondly, was the response to the incident sufficient and adequate under the circumstances? Thirdly, if the incident was an act of terrorism, could the incident encourage similar acts? All evidence points to the conclusio n that the derailment was a calculated and deliberate act. It was designed to cause an accident resulting in the maximum amount of property destruction, injury, and loss o f life. The perpetrators selected a spot that was remote from observat ion and detection. The location was on a railroad line wit h relat ively light traffic, which provided ample time to accomplish the work needed to damage the track and bypass the signal system. The last train to pass the site prior to the Sunset had gone by 18 hours before the derailment. The Amtrak train was scheduled through the area at nighttime. The site was on a 30 foot high trestle, on a curve leading to the bridge, which obscured the damaged track until the last minute. Possibly, the perpetrators had a radio scanner and knew the railroad frequencies, which would have provided warning o f any non-scheduled trains, inspect ion cars, or ""extra"" movements. The knowledge that the Sunset was running late could have been obtained easily, alt hough that fact would not have had any significant impact. Knowledge of the railroad signal systems needed to sabotage that system could have been obtained from easily available sources. Tests conducted after the incident showed all safety systems to be in proper order. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that any accidental damage to the track (such as a dislodged boulder falling or a washout of the trestle) would have been detected. What is important to realize is that current techno logy is designed to prevent accidental harm and not as securit y against intent ional  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Amtrak  James Graebner  29  acts. This delineat ion between safet y and securit y is an important one. Safet y invo lves the prevent ion of accidental harm to persons or property caused by unforeseen or foreseeable hazardous condit ions, or inherently dangerous activit ies. Securit y invo lves the prevention of intent io nal acts of harm invo lving criminal or illegal conduct. In the Sunset case, safet y systems would have prevented the derailment had the contributing factors to the derailment arisen from accidental causes. However, the deliberate action o f wiring a shunt to bypass the signal system negated the ""fail-safe"" design of that system. Given the current techno logy and the deliberate determinat ion to commit a criminal act, the Sunset derailment could probably not have been prevented. Alt hough the specific object ives of the group claiming credit for the Sunset derailment, the ""sons o f Gestapo"", remain unclear; references to ""Waco"" and ""Ruby Ridge"" indicate a goal of revenge and int imidat ion. The bo mbings of the Murrah Building in Oklaho ma Cit y and the World Trade Center in New York indicate that the aim o f many rando m acts of terrorism is to attract the maximum amount of publicit y. This is achieved by causing the maximum destruction of property and the indiscriminate injury and death of innocent people. The revulsio n and horror of such attacks, and the widespread media coverage of them, beco mes in itself the immediate goal. In this respect, and viewed strict ly through the criminal and ant i-social mind of a terrorist, the derailment of the Sunset cannot be regarded as a significant ly successful terrorist act. One innocent person was killed, and 65 more were injured. While this is a terrible crime, it is probably less death and injury than that which occurs daily in highway accidents in the State of Arizona. Property damage to Amtrak was roughly $3,000,000 and damage to the Southern Pacific Railroad probably less than one-third of that amount. Media coverage, while intense immediately after the event, fell o ff fa irly rapidly. Nearly two years after the event, people interviewed at random in several cit ies around the country remember the event only vaguely, if at all, in striking contrast to the other two terrorist acts cited above. In this regard an observat ion should be made regarding the phys ical construction of rolling stock. Both the cars and the locomotives are designed to incorporate safet y features to prevent injury in the event of an accident. Railcar strength standards are calculated to prevent the collapse o f car structures. In this instance the structures performed well. The emergency windows were effectively used as intended. Electrical and plumbing systems are specifically designed to withstand derailments and collis io ns. These systems also functioned as designed. Locomotive cabs did not cave in on the crew. There was no fire from spilled fuel. In short, the safet y features  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   30  Amtrak - James Graebner  designed into the rolling stock probably played a key ro le in minimizing death and injury to passengers and crew, just as they would have done were the incident accidental. A brief examinat ion of the current state of signal techno logy in use on American railroads is illustrative. The Sunset derailment occurred on a single-track main line equipped with an Automat ic Block Signal (ABS) system which was arranged for train mo vements in both directions. Train mo vement was governed by a dispatcher through Direct Traffic Control, supplemented by the signal indications of the ABS system. These signals are located alongside the track and are visible to the engineer. In some locations signal indicat ions are provided in the cab of the loco motive but not the Southern Pacific line where the incident occurred. Signals are electronically act ivated by track circuits. The track itself funct ions as a low voltage electric circuit using the rails as its conductor. Whenever this current is interrupted or compromised, the system displays a red signal to train engineers. Similarly, if the circuit detects the presence of a train, because the steel wheel and axles o f locomotives and cars will form a shunt to the circuit, a red signal will be displayed to trains. An ironclad rule of railroading for more than a century has been that a red signal requires a stop. Just prior to the Sunset derailment, the engineer of that train testified that all signals had displayed green. Accordingly, on October 12, 1995, shunt tests were conducted for the signals at the site. These tests showed that signals had been funct ioning correctly. However, as previously described, the perpetrators had deliberately spliced a shunt wire around the dislocated rail sect ion, thus bridging and preserving the track circuit and allowing signals to display a green signal even though the track had been sabotaged. Signal technology and all other safet y-related aspects of railroad operation are governed by Federal regulat ions as well as railroad operating rules. These rules cover such elements as speed limits, movements of trains, rights of trains, and the inspect ion of equipment. In developing, promulgat ing, revising and enforcing these rules and regulat ions, federal agencies and the railroads constantly examine, analyze, and test their applicatio n against actual field condit ions. In fact, railroad operations and phys ical plant are among the most heavily and consistent ly regulated and inspected activit ies in the United States and signal systems are subject to periodic inspect ion and funct ion verificat ion. Amo ng other requirements, all railroads are required to perform periodic physical track inspect ions. All tracks must be inspected a minimum of twice within a given seven day period, with at least one day between inspect ions.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Amtrak  James Graebner  31  The Southern Pacific Railroad had conducted track inspect ions in full accordance with regulations. These inspect ions utilized track geometry measuring cars which measure and record track tolerance except ions in alignment, profile, gauge, cross level, and warp. As yet another element of track condit ion mo nitoring, railroads depend on ""trip reports"" completed and submitted by loco motive engineers to note and ident ify potentially hazardous condit ions. In addit ion to the regulat ions which cover track and signal systems of American railroads, the locomotives and cars which make up the trains are subject to industry and governmental design standards in order to assure safet y. CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION The derailment site was judged to be a crime scene during the very early stages of the rescue efforts. The site was sealed, wit h Southern Pacific Railway Po lice establishing a securit y ring in the immediate area, and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department establishing a nine-mile perimeter. Everyone within the perimeter was interviewed by the FBI or local authorit ies. By 9:30 a.m., FBI evidence co llect ion teams began searching the area and collect ing evidence. This activit y lasted throughout the fo llowing day. Comprehensive aerial photos were taken. Two Southern Pacific locomotives were dispatched fro m Phoenix to move the four cars that had remained on the track back to Phoenix, alo ng with the remaining passengers. Arriving in Phoenix about 1:30 p.m., the passengers were taken by bus under police escort to a Holiday Inn near the airport, where the Red Cross had set up a center. FBI agents were on hand to interview passengers and co llect detailed questionnaires. Passengers were released later in the day. Public Relations Media officers were dispatched to the scene as quickly as possib maintains a polic y whereby all media statements are coordinated Public Affairs offices in Washington D.C. Amtrak personnel are aware of this po licy and of the necessit y for coordinat ing all relat ing to major events. Investigation A total o f 16 railroad police officers, consist ing of eight members fro m the Southern Pacific and eight detectives fro m the Amtrak Police Depart ment, responded. The FBI was designated the lead agency to conduct the investigat ion and over 150 of their agents were invo lved in the effort. le. Amtrak through its trained and statements  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   32  Amtrak - James Graebner  The Federal Railroad Administration sent inspectors to the area, and the National Transportation Safet y Board sent in a team, as per Federal guidelines, to examine the site for cause and to ascertain that the railroad was operating within prescribed Federal regulations. Both the Amtrak Police Depart ment and the FBI established 1-800 telephone numbers for anyo ne wanting to call wit h information regarding the derailment. A reward fund of $100,000 was established for any informat ion leading to the arrest and convict ion of the perpetrators. LESSONS LEARNED Under the circumstances and given the deso late location of the incident site, Amtrak management, emplo yees and government agencies responded rapidly and efficient ly, a testimo ny to extensive prior planning and training. The most important lesson that this incident provided was the necessit y for Amtrak to maintain regular and closer contact with law enforcement and rescue services. Towards that object ive, Amtrak police are placing greater emphasis on maintaining closer links wit h the National Associat ion of Sheriffs and the National Associat ion of Police Chiefs. While offering litt le so lution to the problem, the incident highlights the vulnerabilit y o f railroad systems in remote and rural areas. The incident also demonstrates the need to increase the frequency o f track patrols. Sensible precautions and efficient response can minimize the effects of an attack but an extended system like Amtrak is never abso lutely safe from a determined terrorist. As of this date, no arrests have been made in the Sunset Limited incident.  Norman Y.

Savage  33  THE NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT AUTHORITY Contingency Planning for Emergency Response By Thomas J. Savage Recent events around the world have underlined the growing threat posed by terrorists and other vio lent criminals to public transportation systems. To terrorists who appear increasingly willing to carry out large-scale indiscriminate attacks, public transportation offers concentrations o f people, enclo sed environments that enhance the effects of bo mbs or chemical weapons, little securit y, ease of escape, and the guarantee of widespread publicit y and public alarm. Extortionists driven by personal greed and mentally disturbed individuals add to the threat. We have witnessed an increase in such attacks: a crazed gunman aboard an MTA Long Island Rail Road commuter train; a bo mbing in the Paris Metro; an explosive device in New York's subway; suicide attacks on buses in Tel-Aviv; the deliberate derailment of a train in Arizona; and, a most alarming precedent, the chemical weapons attacks on Tokyo's subways. Assuming that these attacks will continue and that a catastrophic incident is possible, The New York Cit y Transit Authorit y (NYC Transit) has developed a complex array o f contingency plans to protect the world's largest urban transportation system. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM MTA New York City Transit Overview MTA New York Cit y Transit operates one of the world's largest and most complex metropolitan transportation systems, providing 24-hour-a-day bus and subway service throughout New York's five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx. The agency carries 1.5 billio n passengers annually wit h the largest bus fleet in North America and the largest subway fleet in the world. Every weekday more than five millio n bus and subway journeys are undertaken by co mmuters. Nationwide, approximately four out of every ten mass transit journeys occur in New York Cit y. NYC Transit's primary goal is to operate and maintain the system in a state of good repair. Towards this end, the state and federal governments have expended billio ns of do llars in one of the largest public work efforts ever undertaken. The missio n of NYC Transit is to achieve excellence in providing a safe, orderly, customer-oriented, and cost-effect ive, public transportation system.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   34  New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  The NYC Transit system is co mprised of two primary operating depart ments: the Department of Subways and the Department of Buses. About Subway Service The Department of Subways is co mprised of approximately 24,600 emplo yees distributed between two primary divis io ns: Service Delivery and Maintenance of Way. The Divisio n o f Service Delivery includes: Car Equipment, responsible for the maintenance and cleaning of NYC Transit's more than 5,800 revenue subway cars and 450 non-revenue work cars; Rapid Transit Operations, which operates more than 570 trains per day, carrying about 3.5 millio n customers each weekday; and, Station Maintenance and Operations, responsible for token and MetroCard sales, cleaning, maintenance, and the qualit y of life in the system's 468 stations. The Divisio n o f Maintenance of Way includes: Track, which maintains almo st 850 miles of mainline and yard track; Infrastructure, which maintains the subway's tunnels, elevated structures, buildings and other facilit ies; and, Electrical, which operates and maintains Transit 's power substation and third rail power distribut ion system, and signal and co mmunicat ions networks. About Bus Service The Department of Buses operates 207 local and 30 express-bus routes out of 19 depots with a staff o f 12,000 emplo yees. The bus system's 3,554 buses carry about 1.4 millio n customers daily and 451 millio n annually. Each rush hour about 3,100 buses are in operation, picking up customers at more than 14,000 bus stops. INCIDENT RESPONSE Assessment of the Threat The internat ional pro file o f New York Cit y, together with the very magnitude of the NYC Transit system and its inherent vulnerabilit y, makes it an ideal cho ice for a terrorist. Polit ical mot ivat ions lay behind one series o f terrorist acts that were planned but never accomplished. On June 24, 1993, a team of  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  35  FBI agents and NYC Police raided a garage in Queens and arrested five persons who were in the act of mixing chemicals for a bomb. An addit ional ten arrests were carried out during the course of the next few months in connection wit h a plot to bomb the United Nations headquarters, the main federal o ffice building in New York Cit y, and the Linco ln and Holland tunnels. All o f these incidents were connected with Islamic extremists. In addit ion to the terrorist threat, the actions of deranged individuals also present a risk. In December 1993, Colin Ferguson began firing rando mly at passengers travelling from New York on a crowded Long Island Rail Road train during rush hour. Ferguson, who was finally overpowered by passengers while reloading, killed six passengers and wounded 17 others. In December of 1994, Edward Leary detonated two gasoline bombs on subway trains. The first was on December 15, at 145th Street and Lennox Avenue in upper Manhattan, injuring three people. In the second incident, on December 21 at Fulton Street and Broadway, the device exploded prematurely and 48 people, including Leary, were injured. He was then apprehended. In November 1995, three criminals attempted to rob a subway token booth at Kingston and Throop Avenues in Brooklyn. In an attempt to int imidate the token booth clerk, they sprayed a flammable liquid through the change aperture of the Halon system-equipped booth. The clerk was badly burned and died fro m his injuries several days later. Media coverage of this incident resulted in a number of copycat attacks and threats. In general, threats to the New York Cit y Transit system can be categorized as fo llo ws:  terrorism by eit her convent ional weapons and weapons of mass destruction  accidental disasters such as derailments  natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and winter storms causing power outages Security Organization and Personnel The size of New York Cit y precludes the transit authorit ies fro m developing ant i-terrorist policies and procedures in a vacuum. NYC Transit works closely wit h the cit y's emergency services such as the New York Fire Department (NYFD), the New York Cit y Police (NYPD), the International Red Cross, and the Salvat ion Army's Emergency Services. Managing the overall coordinat ion of the cit y's emergency services is the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management (OEM). The commo n goal of these services is to be prepared for, and able to coordinate, rapid and effect ive responses to a wide range of emergency situat ions.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   36  New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  The Mayor's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, by Execut ive Order, established the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) with responsibility for interagency and intergovernmental coordinat ion of NYC's responses to emergencies. This job includes the development of all emergency plans, training, preparation, and response to all emergencies. The OEM is direct ly responsible for the coordinat ion of all emergency services but does not govern their operational activit ies. The OEM was born out of the need for clear lines o f command and control when responsibilit y and accountabilit y can beco me blurred as a result of the dynamics of a co mplicated and urgent situation. For example, if an explo sion occurs on a railway track and the NYFD is the first emergency service to respond, it will take the operational lead. However, should a suspicious object be found to have caused the blast, the NYPD will assume control of the situation unt il it is sat isfied that no crime has been committed or unt il their invest igat ions have been completed. Once the NYPD has declared the area safe, the control may switch back to the NYFD or the NYC Transit as circumstances dictate. Security Plans NYC Transit actively participates in the planning, training, and response to any emergency. To aid in co mbating terrorism, a task force was created to develop a Chemical/Bio logical Incident Contingency Plan. Chemical/Biological Incident Contingency Plan In 1996, the OEM established a co mmittee to develop Incident Contingency Plan. The Sarin gas attack in the and a no-notice test of New York's response to terrorist subway system prompted officials to accelerate the process. A review of the no-notice test identified four communicat ions, training, logist ics, and, planning. In special attention were ident ified:      a Chemical/Bio logical Tokyo subway system use of nerve gas in the contingency planning key areas of concern: addit ion, five areas of  coordinat ion with the FBI being prepared for mass casualt ies treating incident as a crime scene need for speedy response act ions to save lives need for specialized training, equipment, and supplies  Norman Y.

The four groups are:  law enforcement  hazardous materials  communicat ions  medical The Law Enforcement Focus Group includes representatives fro m Federal, state, cit y, the Metropolitan Transportation Authorit y (MTA), the parent company of MTA NYC Transit,MTA Long Island Rail Road, MTA MetroNorth Railroad, MTA Bridges and Tunnels, and neighboring state transportation authorit ies.

Considerat ion has been given to critical issues such as symptom recognit ion and ant idote select ion, the availabilit y and delivery o f medical materiel, and first responder awareness and training. Security Technology The New York City Transit has recent ly developed a Co mputer Assisted Design (CAD) Fire and Safet y System. The system is a co mputerized database capable of depicting the rail track network with corresponding street grid, emergency exits, access points, and vent ilat ion fans in selected sectors of the rail track system. The operations control center monitors the movement of all trains and maintains constant communicat ion wit h train operators and line dispatch officers. An emergency mo bile co mmand center equipped wit h a duplicate CAD system as well as other communicat ions facilit ies is dispatched to the scene of all major emergencies.  Norman Y.

Each train operator and train supervisor is in radio contact with the command center by radio but the radios are not always powerful enough to penetrate the physical structures. To supplement the radio network, land-lines have been established at regular intervals alo ng the tracks. To improve po lice and other emergency communicat ions in the subway, NYC Transit is complet ing the design of a 130 millio n dollar radio system. Training In ant icipat ion of major emergencies, NYC Transit conducts emergency response and rescue exercises. These vary fro m simulat ions to organized, planned drills to ""no-notice"" simulat io primary object ive of these exercises is to ident ify defic iencies emergency plans and coordinat ion and communication problems. Contingency Planning and Emergency Response The evaluation process of terrorist contingency plans is an ongoing act ivit y. In conjunct ion wit h the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, NYC Transit constant ly evaluates its emergency management principles, plans, and procedures. NYC Transit is act ive in the development and implementation of its emergency cont ingency plans and procedures. For example, fo llowing the Sarin gas attack in Japan, the NYPD and the NYC government formed a task force to review securit y issues on New York City mass transit systems. The object ive of this task force was to develop their response capabilit ies and to reduce the vulnerabilit y o f the system. The committee made five pertinent recommendat ions, the details o f which are confident ial, but information and guidance about gas attacks have been distributed to relevant emplo yees and vent ilat ion procedures for cars and stations were reviewed. These init iat ives have been supplemented by contingency planning and regular inter-agency simulat ions and training exercises that focus on responding to chemical or bio logical incidents. regular desktop ns.

Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  41  On November 8, 9, and 10, 1997, NYC OEM coordinated the largest series of terrorism response drills ever conducted by the city. Officials emphasized to the public that the exercise was not prompted by the possibilit y o f an attack but toward reducing the potential danger of a terrorist chemical incident. The drills included testing the reactions of emergency responders in 41 cit y hospitals; 600 cit y, state, and federal law enforcement officers and emergency workers, limit ing damage fro m a hypothetical chemical attack in a two-block area, and a tabletop exercise reviewing infrastructure issues. CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION ISSUES A full range of emergency procedures designed for all foreseeable emergency situations has been developed and distributed and is regularly updated. NYC Transit detaches a track maintenance crew to respond to emergencies. Research conducted among a number of transportation authorit ies reveals that after the immediate safety and securit y of public, transportation, and emergency personnel, the primary concern of any transportation authorit y is the speedy restoration of operations. This makes sound business sense and is vitally important for any public ut ilit y because a quick return to normalit y has the important psycho logical advantage of restoring public confidence. This action sends a signal to the public that despite the efforts of terrorists, the public infrastructure and general population remain resilient and capable of withstanding such assaults. It is an enormous morale booster. Public Affairs For all public transit authorit ies the perception o f competence is crucial. Statements concerning the reaction, response, and attitudes to the problem should reflect the appropriate degree of concern, support, reassurance, and empathy for the vict ims. It is imperative that these concerns are expressed quickly and through a single authorit y or official spokesperson. During major emergencies, the OEM is responsible for providing coordinated informat ion to the public. Informat ion about service cont inuat ion and the restoration of operations is provided by the NYC Transit 's public affa irs office and the necessary service announcements are broadcast through the media, on the system's public address system at station plat forms, and in subway cars. Augmented Security and Essential Initiatives In major emergencies, the NYC Transit is able to call upon the law enforcement resources of the New York Cit y Police. With the recent appoint ment of the OEM as the overall coordinating body during  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   42  New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  emergencies, the OEM is able to muster the addit ional services under the jurisdict ion of the mayor. There are characterist ics co mmo n to all major transportation disasters, including terrorist attacks. Disasters can result in numerous injuries and disrupt ion of transportation and they call for a large-scale response. This similarit y o f characterist ics implies that there are several essent ials co mmo n to all emergency responses. Accurate and Timely Intelligence One of the first steps in prevent ing terrorism is having knowledge about potential terrorist activit y. It is equally important to be able to assess the scope and the validit y of any threats received. An ongo ing dialogue wit h a variet y of agencies and sources in order to be fully apprised of all situat ions is important. At the nat ional level, the sources include the FBI, the ATF, and the State Department. Local examples include the Intelligence Divisio n of the NYPD. At the scene of a genuine emergency much valuable informat ion should be obtained from the first responders to determine the type and level of response required . Rapid Deployment Getting emergency responders to the scene quickly can be the most effect ive way to minimize the amount of death, injury, and destruction caused by both terrorist acts and natural or accidental disasters. Proper usage of the incident command system in the deplo yment of personnel is invaluable in accomplishing rapid response. Effective Tactics and Training All first responders need to know both their own and each other's emergency response funct ions. This is achieved through the cross-training of personnel. As an example, the NYC Transit and the New York Cit y po lice share basic knowledge of transportation, track safety, and the recognition of switches and signals that have been tampered with. Emergency response drills wit h scenarios drawn fro m recent incidents are also useful for practicing procedures and recognizing areas for improvement. Transportation agencies must also have proper plans and procedures in place that are constantly adapted to new threats. For example, after the Sarin gas attacks in Japan, New York Cit y Transit developed new procedures regarding the movement of trains through tunnels and the use of vent ilat ion equipment during such incidents.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  43  Coordination Coordinat ion procedures must be in place before a disaster strikes. Emergency agencies must work to establish effect ive channels o f communicat ion and to standardize procedures in emergency response. Procedures were tested recently with a mock gas attack drill in New York. The exercise revealed that unnecessary confusio n was caused by the co lors of protective clothing used by the several different agencies invo lved. One co lor was used by one agency to ident ify personnel wit h a specific function; the same color was used by another group to indicate workers with a co mpletely different assignment. The importance of cross-agency standardizat ion in this otherwise overlooked area became readily apparent. Another source of misco mmunicat ion was the interpretation of the words ""vict im"" or ""stretcher."" The terms have different meanings depending on whether one is a member of the Fire Department's Emergency Medical Service, NYPD's Rescue Unit, or New York Cit y Transit. Again, standardization would appear to be an answer. Proper Equipment The increase in the numbers and t ypes of hazardous materials which encountered in disasters have made the requirement of having equipment more important than ever. In addit ion to the tools hit herto extract victims or to fight fires, emergency response agencies no equipment and garb that will protect the rescuers as well. LESSONS LEARNED To an overwhelming degree the type of emergency response to the scene of a terrorist attack will be the same as that required for emergencies and disasters fro m natural or accidental causes. Derailments and explosio ns occur accidentally as well as intent ionally, as do hazardous material incidents, and every agency should have in place emergency response procedures that can be adapted to such incidents. Nevertheless, it is regrettably true that in numerous cases o f emergency response, by even the most experienced agencies, certain commo n errors appear time and again. The New York City Transit Police Department (the predecessor to NYPD's Transit Divis io n) developed a Crit ical Incident Manual in 1993 that considered a number of these co mmon errors in an effort to discover methods of prevent ing their occurrence in future incidents. Some o f those lessons will now be considered. Dispatch Adequate Resources Emergency response units requested and dispatched to the scene should resist the temptation to jump in and try to correct the condit ion before conducting a may be proper used to w have  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   44  New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  thorough assessment of the condit ions surrounding the incident. The results of their assessment must be communicated immediately and appropriate and adequate resources dispatched. First responders at the scene should have the authority to request addit ional units without having to request authorizat ion because this results in wasted time. Redundant units or resources can always be returned to base or to service. Direction to Responding Units Emergency workers often fail to remember that other personnel responding to an incident may not be familiar with the facilit ies at the scene. Time is lost during those crit ical first minutes when responding units park in the wrong place, go to the wrong entrance and cannot find the cause of the emergency. It is wise to invest some resources to provide preliminary instructions. Between emergencies, public utilit y agencies and emergency response services should allocate the time needed to understand the operational procedures of each inst itution. A striking example of what can go wrong was seen in the response to the Avianca plane crash on Long Island in January o f 1990. The site of the crash was a wooded area on a peninsula wit h a single two-lane access road. Numerous units fro m all over Long Island responded but the lack of direct ions resulted in a massive snarl of emergency equipment heading toward the site. Essent ial equipment could not get to the site and ambulances and other vehicles that had already arrived could not get out. Much of the confusio n could have been avo ided wit h better preliminary informat ion being made available to and by the first responders. Establish Perimeters The stabilizat ion of the immediate area where the incident has occurred must be one of the first priorit ies. To accomplish this, an inner perimeter, located a safe distance from the incident, must be established using either personnel or natural barriers. All non-essent ial individuals, including those in uniform, must be kept outside this area. An outer perimeter must also be established. Between the inner and outer perimeter, staging areas, command posts, treatment areas, and other facilit ies can be established. Frequent ly perimeters are established in the wrong places or effect ive perimeters are not established at all. In addit ion, emergency responders must remember that the site may also be a crime scene. After init ial responders have rendered aid to victims, all non-essent ial personnel must be cleared fro m the scene to preserve as much of the remaining evidence as possible.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  45  Establish a Single Unified Command The hive of act ivit y that characterizes mass casualty scenes o ften creates confusio n. Wit hout a single unified co mmand with established and recognized control, unit s frequent ly work independently and at crosspurposes, or simply waste time duplicat ing efforts. The result is disorganizat ion. This mistake can be co mpounded when the police, fire, emergency medical services and the transit authorit y establish separate commands for their own services but with little or no communicat ion with other services. Communicat ion and coordinat ion are therefore essent ial. As was stated earlier, proper use of the incident command system will so lve many of these problems. Delegate Authority Wit hin an incident command system, sect ions, branches and teams are responsible for specific funct ions, such as staging, rescue, field invest igat ions, and medical treatment. Delegat ing authorit y to those who are responsible for these funct ions permit s a reasonable span of control for the incident commander. Section and branch supervisors manage tasks and develop and implement tactics within their area of responsibility, which allows the incident commander to concentrate on a strategy for providing support to those who are actually do ing the job. The system only works, however, if the incident commander consciously delegates authorit y to the appropriate personnel. Maintain an Incident Log It is impossible for the incident commander to keep all the informat ion he needs in his head especially under crisis condit io ns. The incident commander, as well as those in control of sect ions and branches must keep a record of assignments, the times assignments are made, accomplishments, problems, and other pertinent informat ion. It must also be kept in mind, however, that ordinary record keeping resources will not be available at the scene o f emergencies. An example of this point occurred after Hurricane Andrew struck Florida. The lengthy disrupt ion of electricity made the photocopying of direct ives and instructions impossible, and old-fashio ned carbon paper became a scarce but vital co mmodit y. Wear Identifying Clothing or Emblems The incident commander, as well as those funct ions, need to be ident ified by vests ident ified in a crowd, but this is too often no hear the complaint, ""No one knew who was who are responsible for specific or caps so they can be easily t the case. It is far too common to in charge.""  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   46  New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  Provide Useful Progress Reports Decisio ns cannot be made wit hout informat ion. The incident commander must be kept advised of needs and of progress. The incident commander cannot react and provide necessary resources without this information. The branch and sect ion supervisors are in the best positio n to determine what problems and needs exist within their areas. Problems or progress within a given area will have an impact on other areas, and on the overall incident operation. Too much insignificant information, however, can be a handicap and lead to overload. Supervisors must exercise their discret ion in determining what informat ion is relevant. Supervisors Involved in Physical Tasks During mo ment beco ming work urgency of the physical tasks, t s of stress, ers instead situation. hey lose co some supervisors try to avoid making decisio ns by of managers or they may just be swept up in the In either case, once they beco me invo lved in the ntrol of their resources and responsibilit ies.  Establish Staging Areas Usually incident scenes are only able to absorb a limit ed number of vehicles and personnel. Therefore, the incident commander must establish personnel and vehicle staging areas as quickly as possible. It is much more efficient to direct all resources to a central staging area to await organized introduction to the core area. Staging areas should also be pre-planned as much as possible in order to make their select ion during an emergency simple. In New York Cit y, each police precinct has ident ified a variet y of locat ions in the area that would be appropriate staging areas for any emergency response in the vicinit y (e.g., schools with school yards or public buildings wit h parking lots,). Accessible Staging Area The bigger the incident, the more apparatus and personnel are likely to respond and a large staging area will be required. The staging officer must organize the parking of all vehicles to permit easy mo vement out of the staging areas. It is also most important that the keys to the vehicles eit her be left in the vehicles or with some designated person. Parking The congest ion caused by the unorganized arrival and parking of emergency vehicles is a recurring problem that is found even under the best circumstances and with the most experienced agencies. When police, firefighters, or emergency medical personnel arrive on a scene, their first thought is usually to get to the core of the incident as quickly as possible.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  47  Consequent ly litt le or no thought is given to how other vehicles will be able to get in and out if the incident is a major one. As a result, the fire trucks and police cars frequent ly block the ambulances; the first ambulances to arrive often hinder or prevent the arrival o f other emergency vehicles. To avoid the problem, interagency protocols must be developed for emergency vehicles and all emergency personnel must be continually retrained in these protocols so that their use beco mes automat ic. When the Lexington Avenue Express derailed under Unio n Square in August, 1991, the derailment destroyed or damaged a number of the columns supporting the tunnel. This in turn caused the surface of the street above to drop perceptibly. Numerous units from the Fire Department were among the first to respond and, not realizing that the subway ran direct ly beneath them, parked their heavy equipment directly above the scene o f the accident. Fortunately this was noticed in time and a more serious problem was narrowly avo ided. Responses to major emergencies are often not over quickly and thought must always be given to how the positioning of a vehicle will affect the provisio n of appropriate response further on, whether it is ten minutes later or an hour in the future. Provide Adequate Safety Precautions Mass casualt y incidents always present safet y hazards to emergency personnel. The safet y needs of rescuers as well as patients must not be overlooked. Wreckage may need to be secured to prevent movement or collapse. Rescuers may need to wear protective clothing such as helmets, gloves, eye protection, and protective coats. The Incident Commander and Available Personnel Personnel should match the needs of the incident. Heavy co mmit ments of personnel may be needed in the extraction area during the early stages of the incident because most of those needing assistance will be found there. As rescue operations progress, many of the victims will be moved to the medical treatment area or hospital, so fewer personnel will be required in the extraction area and more in the treatment area. As personnel beco me available, the rescue supervisor must advise the incident commander of the new resource. The incident commander may then reassign those personnel to other areas as needed. Treat Patients Where They Are Found Rescuers tend to treat patients where they are found rather than mo ve them to a triage area. Some types of injuries (for example, blo cked airways or serious external bleeding) require on-the-spot medical assistance, but more extensive first aid should be done at a central triage area. A central treatment area permits maximum use of personnel and other resources. If the patient is  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   48  New York City Transit Authority  Thomas J. Savage  trapped, requiring lengthy extraction, then extended treatment within the area may be appropriate. The Medical Treatment Area Patients placed helter-skelter in the treatment area will co mpound an already disastrous situation. They must be placed in some organized fashio n, e.g., crit ical pat ients to one side, delayed treatment patients to another. First arriving injured should be placed near the exit transportation loading area first, then fill towards the entrance. This eliminates the problem of having to step over patients when carrying in new arrivals. It is also easy to overlook patients or not notice changes in their condit ion. The medical branch supervisor should assign at least one person (preferably so meone wit h medical experience) to each category of pat ients, with instructions to check them frequently. Failure to Alert or Update Hospitals on Situation Alerting Hospitals There are still reported cases of hospitals learning of mass casualt y incidents when the first patients came through the door. Procedures and protocols should require immediate alerting of hospitals when a major incident is recognized. Reasonably accurate informat ion on the nature and severit y o f the incident should be provided so that the hospital has t ime to prepare to receive and treat the injured. Keeping Hospitals Informed Hospitals often call personnel back to duty and pull staff fro m other floors and wards to meet the emergency room needs of a disaster. To keep the hospital on continued alert long after the last patient has been transported is not only costly but jeopardizes other patient care. Hospitals should be informed when the last of the injured have been taken fro m the scene of the disaster. Final Comments New York has so far escaped intense attacks like the gas attacks in Japan and the repeated bombings in Paris. However, as the largest urban transportation system in the world, it is a tempting and vulnerable target. A major attack on New York Cit y Transit would be seen as a blow to the United States. New York's efforts to guard against this possibilit y is a complex and expensive undertaking but the realit ies o f the nat ional and international situat ions make them necessary.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  49  THE METROPOLITAN ATLANTA RAPID TRANSIT AUTHORITY Contingency Planning for the 1996 Olympics by Shaun P. McCarthy The biggest event that the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) has ever had to confront was the 1966 Atlanta Olympic Games. Complex planning and costly precaut ions were taken to protect the transit systems and its patrons from ordinary crimes and terrorist attack. As it happened, a bomb did go off during the fest ivit ies but the explosio n occurred in a public park, not within the transit system. If the bo mb had exploded within the confined space of a transit station or a train, the casualt ies might have been much higher. Perhaps the reason MARTA escaped the attack was because of the extraordinary preventative measures that had been taken. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM MARTA began rail operations in 1979, beginning with its East Line. MARTA has since expanded to five rail lines with 36 rail stations and 46 miles of heavy rail. MARTA owns 240 rail cars and 667 passenger busses. The Bus Divis io n runs 150 routes and averages nearly 30 millio n route miles per year. The Rail Divisio n runs trains every eight minutes through its stations and averages 23 millio n route miles per year. MARTA normally carries 470,000 bus and rail riders per average weekday and parks approximately 30,000 commuter vehicles per day. Fares are currently $1.50 one way, with free transfers. Magnet ically coded weekly and mo nthly passes, or ""Transcards,"" can be purchased for unlimited rides at $12.00 and $45.00, respectively. MARTA also receives a 1% sales tax share in Fulton and DeKalb count ies to assist with the funding of its operations. INCIDENT RESPONSE Threat or Special Circumstances The 1996 Olympic Games presented MARTA and its po lice personnel with unprecedented challenges. Since the PLO attack against the Israeli athletes during the Munich Olympics, this international event has been a high profile target for terrorism and a high risk event for the host countries. MARTA made the commit ment to be the Offic ial Provider of Public Transportation for  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   50  MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  the Olympics. This would entail mo ving over one millio n passengers a day to and fro m competit ion venues, public parks, and downtown businesses. Never before had MARTA attempted to move such a large cont ingent of people over such an extended period of time. The estimated numbers invo lved were four to five times the system's normal ridership figures. The Olympic schedule for MARTA's po lice officers began Monday, July 15, 1996. This was four days before the opening ceremo nies on Friday, July 19. The object ive behind the early schedule was to establish a highly visible law enforcement presence and to assist with the influx of customers into the system. MARTA's Airport Station and the Five Po ints and Peachtree Center Stations, which serve the downtown hotel district, experienced large increases in riders prior to the games. On Wednesday, July 17, a public dress rehearsal of the opening ceremony was held at the Olympic Stadium. Wit h approximately 80,000 spectators travelling to one location, this proved to be the first major test of the West End Station and the designated shuttle bus station for the stadium. A co mparat ively small station, it was not known how West End would be able to accommodate the large crowd and how its size would affect operations. MARTA conducted a lengthy public awareness campaign prior to this event and informed the public that there would be a wait ing period of at least one hour to enter the system. Under the circumstances, the system performed well and the crowds were mo ved at an acceptable pace. The key was to keep the trains mo ving, to regulate queue lines, and to maintain a strong police presence. The crowds behaved in an orderly manner as long as they could see that movement was taking place. Although the trains were jammed, no problems were experienced. Bus shuttles were run by ACOG (Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games) and OSTS (Olympic Spectator Transportation System). OSTS experienced so me problems wit h mo ving the crowds as not enough buses were on hand. However, this problem was rectified before the Opening Ceremonies on Friday night. West End proved to be capable of handling the crowds, provided enough police, barricades, and trains were available. During the Olympics the station averaged over 100,000 passengers per day. The Games proper commenced on Saturday, July 20. The increase in commuters was significant and immediate, with a daily average rail boarding of between 1 and 1.3 millio n, a record for MARTA. All MARTA parking lots were filled by 7:30 a.m. The punctualit y o f trains was an essent ial factor in keeping the crowds moving. In addit ion, well-des igned queue lines and sufficient treasury assistance at the faregates facilitated crowd control. An effect ive public address system and the use of bullhorns to keep the riders  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  51  informed of delays were essent ial elements in the effect ive control of the stations. One major change that was not anticipated, however, was the huge impact the Games had on the Peachtree Center Station. This station serves the hotel district and is one block from the centerpiece of the cit y, the new Centennial Olympic Park. On Saturday, July 20, the crowds were tremendous, and the public's safet y became a crucial issue. The station was transformed into one huge queue. The two north entrance/exits of the station were converted into exit facilit ies only, and the two south entrances/exits converted into entrances only. Police wit h bullhorns and barricades were in place to enforce access control. The press was notified of the change and the situation was well publicized. This change worked well, and the crowds were properly managed. The Games ended on Sunday, August 4. The crowds had moved easily and smoothly, and the MARTA police officers had beco me accustomed to the pace. By Tuesday, August 6, ridership was back to near normal levels. The Police Olympic Schedule was suspended at 2:00 a.m. on August 7, and the MARTA Police Operations Center (MPOC ) was closed. For the most part, comments from the public were positive. They understood that there would be large crowds and long waits, and accepted the condit ions. The MARTA Police Divisio n was responsible for crowd control operations at all MARTA Rail Stations, all law enforcement, and any emergency response required on the bus and rail systems during the Games. The Divisio n was also given the responsibilit y for target hardening (providing extra physical protection against attack), emplo yee awareness training, and the procurement of necessary equipment for Olympic Securit y Operat ions. Assessment of the Threat As ment ioned previously, MARTA was designated the Official Provider of Public Transportation during the Olympic Games. MARTA was the backbone of the spectator transportation system as public parking was not allowed at any o f the downtown Olympic venues. Essentially everyo ne who was going to any of the Olympic stadia (the Georgia Do me, the Omni Coliseum, or Centennial Olympic Park) had to use the MARTA system to get there. The sheer size of the Games co mplicated transportation operations. The At lanta Games were touted as ""the largest peacetime event in world history,"" with over 12 millio n spectator tickets available. The At lanta Games were planned to be larger than the Seoul (Korea) and the Barcelo na (Spain) Olympics co mbined. Nearly 75% of the Olympic events were to be held inside the ""Olympic Ring,"" an imaginary circle three miles in diameter in downtown Atlanta. This ""ring""  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   52  MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  is an area served by MARTA's largest rail stations: Peachtree Center, Five Points and Omni/Do me Stations. (See Map of MARTA System in the appendix). Never in the history of the Games had so many events been held in such a concentrated area. To facilitate and encourage this mo vement, a precedent was set by agreement with ACOG (At lanta Committee for the Olympic Games). By simply showing your Olympic event ticket at any MARTA station or bus, one would be allowed to ride MARTA free that day. Daily entries of up to one and a half millio n riders a day were predicted. The police services recognized that significant planning, deplo yment, and logist ical work had to be done to meet this enormous challenge. Alt hough aware that the Olympics were a potential target for crimina l and polit ical vio lence, the aggregate intelligence on hand provided no indication of any specific, impending terrorist threat to the Olympics or to the MARTA transportation system. Security Organization and Personnel The MARTA Divisio n o f Police Services consists of 217 armed, uniformed police officers, 29 sergeants, 9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors, and a Director/Chief o f Police. The Divisio n also conducts its own investigations with a Detective Unit, operates four Bike Patrol Teams, has a special Bus Patrol Unit, and maintains a 10 member Special Operations Response Team (S.O.R.T.) capable of tactical and chemical response. The MARTA Po lice have full po lice jurisdict ion on MARTA property as well as in the cit ies and counties in which MARTA operates. MARTA maintains its own records sect ion, radio dispatch system, and Zone Monitors who staff a closed circuit televisio n center (CCTV) and answer customer assistance telephones. The MARTA Police Divisio n routinely patrols all MARTA rail stat facilit ies, adjacent parking lots, heavy rail cars, and bus routes. percent of the patrols conducted in the stations and on the trains are foot. Mobile patrols are conducted by marked police cars on each There is one uniformed officer on every train from 1500 to 2300 ho day and plainclothes officers make regular patrols. Planning MARTA Police Services began preliminary planning approximately three years prior to the event. Init ial planning started with an examinat ion of personnel allocat ions and projected shift requirements. The Divisio n assigned Captain T.D. Rogers to ACOG Security to assist with the overall Olympic Securit y efforts. In May 1995, Major M.A. Parker and MARTA Chief Safet y ions and Ninet y done on rail line. urs each  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  53  Officer Tracy Pluff traveled to FEMA training headquarters at Mount Weather, Virginia, where they part icipated in a crowd planning exercise. In July 1995, Lt. Joe McKinney was designated Olymp ic Coordinator for MARTA Police to facilitate logist ics, organize target hardening, act as interdepartmental liaiso n, and to decide personnel staffing for the Department. The first task of the planning process was to determine how to best utilize available manpower. The divisio n made a co mmitment to have at least one MARTA Police officer in each rail station 24 hours a day during the Games. Variat ions of work hours, length of work week, and numbers o f officers per shift were examined to determine how to meet the needs of the Divisio n, without exhaust ing the officers. As larger crowds were expected to use the system between 6:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m., it was determined that 12 hour shift s, with four consecut ive days on duty, then one day off, would maximize MARTA police coverage. The shift s were fro m 0530 to 1730 hours, 1430 to 0230 hours, and 1800 to 0600 hours. This schedule enabled MARTA to have the majorit y of its officers on duty during the most crowded times, and maintain at least one officer per station during the slower early morning hours. (See the Staff Chart) The schedule was designed to keep individual officers in the same stations during the ent ire Olympic period to assure that they were familiar wit h their assigned stations and to maintain accountabilit y. The system was well received and proved successful. Personnel MARTA Police recognized that an addit ional 250 to 300 personnel would be required to ensure adequate securit y and crowd control on MARTA during the Games. The crowd project ions were too large to be handled by only one or two officers at each rail station. Even with the police personnel working 12 hour shifts and only one rest day per week, manpower capabilit ies were stretched to the limit. The police requested the MARTA General Manager to temporarily reassign MARTA civilian personnel from their regular duties to assist police during the Games. Fift y (50) to eight y (80) personnel were available to assist the police during the games. The MARTA Police also requested other transit agencies across America to assign officers to MARTA for the Games. For various reasons, only BART in San Francisco fulfilled its co mmit ment, sending five officers to help for two  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   54  MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  weeks. While their assistance was invaluable, MARTA was not able to muster its target of addit ional transit officers. During May, MARTA Police Chief Gene Wilson took up the staffing plight with Gil Childers, Special Assistant to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. Mr. Childers took special interest in the staffing dilemma and began working with federal and state authorities to help rectify the situation. This enabled MARTA to be recognized as a ""State Law Enforcement Venue"" and to tap into the resources of the 4,000 member-strong State and Federal law enforcement contingent of S.O.L.E.C., the State Olymp ic Law Enforcement Command. This agency, set up by the Governor of Georgia and headed by Gary McConnell to provide extra federal and state law enforcement support to the Olympic Securit y effort, committed 200 sworn law enforcement personnel to MARTA. The allocat ion of these officers enabled MARTA to meet its commit ments and to manage the crowds safely and efficient ly. ACOG paid MARTA for police overtime incurred during the Games. Early on the Divisio n had requested funds to offset the huge cost of overtime that would be necessary to handle the Olympic activit ies. The Divis io n obtained nearly $900,000 to cover the extra police coverage required before, during and after the Games. ACOG agreed to pay this cost, as the coverage obviously had a direct effect of the Games co ming to Atlanta. Logistics A great deal of logist ical support was required to support the MARTA Po lice efforts. The issues of addit ional personnel, barricades, food, water, signage, shelter for the public, portable toilets, bullhorns, traffic cones, and first aid; all had to be addressed by the department. MARTA Police were assisted and supported by the Authorit y's Facilit ies Maintenance divis io n in many areas. A total of 330 wooden barricades were fabricated and painted to supplement the exist ing 200 metal barricades. In addit ion, approximately 100 signs for crowd and traffic control were prepared. Both of these items proved invaluable in handling the huge vo lumes o f vehicular and pedestrian traffic using MARTA during the Games. The Facilit ies staff also arranged for the rental of 100 portable toilets, placing them at key rail stations. A total o f 40 bullhorns, 700 traffic cones, and 100 first aid kits were purchased by MARTA fro m a contingency fund. Although the US military had pledged to provide a number of tents and other portable shelters to MARTA for public use, it turned out that none of these items were available.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  55  Security Plans Intelligence was supplied to the MARTA system fro m the State Center. A MARTA representative attended securit y briefings twice a day. The Bureau of Alcoho l, Tobacco and Firearms maintained a bomb center with a dedicated land-line telephone link to MARTA's operations center. The pipe-bo mb explo sion at Centennial Park resulted in the MARTA police increasing their securit y program fro m normal to a ""heightened state of awareness."" MARTA developed and maintained its ""Go Team"" for the duration of the Olympics. This team was comprised of representatives fro m the police, railroad, bus, maintenance, and safet y divisio ns of MARTA. Numerous exercises and tabletop simulations were conducted prior to the event, including a simulat ion held at the civic center that focused on a takeover of a train with hostages. Security Technology Alt hough MARTA invest igated the possibilit y o f removing all rubbish bins fro m the stations, it concluded that this step would produce more disadvantages than advantages. The removal would have resulted in refuse being dumped on the plat forms, causing healt h hazards. This could have resulted in more serious conditions had refuse spilled onto the tracks and caused a short-circuit. In the end it was decided to introduce bomb-resistant containers at strategic stations and to implement and maintain a system whereby all the bins were empt ied and rotated prompt ly. Environmental Design and Construction Features MARTA conscient iously considered crime preventio n during the architectural stage of its planning. All stations are equipped with CCTV monitors. MARTA's power stations are their greatest vulnerabilit y but they have adequate alarm systems and have target-hardening features. One advantage to securit y is the frequency of trains. This makes it physically impossible for saboteurs to tamper with the rails or the signaling system. All trains and buses maintain radio contact with the Central Control center at Avondale. To date, fift y percent of the bus fleet have been equipped wit h Glo bal Positioning System (GPS) units. The Divisio n obtained advice fro m a counter-terrorism expert on target hardening issues. MARTA improved on many areas considered vulnerable to tampering. All the power station's alarm systems were enhanced, perimeter fences were added to crit ical facilit ies, and bo mb-resistant trash containers were placed at Olympic Ring stations. Private vehic les were banned fro m rail and bus facilit ies. These measures helped to add a level of deterrence to securit y preparations. Money expended on these issues proved to be well  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   56  MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  spent; although a bo mbing did occur in Atlanta at Centennial Park, only one block fro m the Peachtree Center station. Communications Despite MARTA Police's efforts to create an overall MARTA Operat ions Center, it did not occur, but they created their own MARTA Police Operations Center (MPOC). The Center was staffed 24 hours a day, beginning a week before the Games and cont inuing for two days after the closing ceremonies. The Center was equipped wit h appropriate radio equipment, phone lines, computer support, cable televis io n for viewing news footage, and all the maps and documents needed for the Games. The Center acted as a communicat ion node between the State Command Centers, the MARTA Bus, Rail, and Maintenance Divisio ns, ACOG, and specialized management agencies such as FBI, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD). It also coordinated personnel movements, S.O.L.E.C. officers, and other logist ics. It was co-staffed with facilit ies maintenance personnel, which expedited requests for maintenance from the field. While an overall MARTA Operations Center, with a representat ive fro m all MARTA divisio ns present in the same room, would have been much more efficient, the MPOC proved adequate. MARTA Police personnel also staffed the State Operations Center (SOC) on Confederate Avenue and the Joint Communicat ions Center (JCC) at Atlanta Police Headquarters, Cit y Hall East. The SOC served as the main control center for all S.O.L.E.C. and State Emergency Management Agency operations invo lved in the Games. The JCC served as an informat ion clearing house for all federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies at the Olympics. These interfaces helped to speed communicat ions between MARTA and other law enforcement jurisdict ions and proved to be valuable as the Games progressed. The State of Georgia provided all S.O.L.E.C. officers with radios tuned to both of the MARTA Police frequencies. To facilitate communicat ions; the officers were allocated a special radio number and were told to use ""plain talk"" in their radio transmissio ns. This procedure worked well and radio discipline was observed. The heads of the key law enforcement agencies started meeting every other day one week before the Games began. The agencies invo lved were the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, the At lanta Police, the Conyers Police, the Fulton County Police and Sheriff, the DeKalb County Po lice, the MARTA Police, the Georgia State Patrol, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (G.B.I.), the  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  57  National Guard, S.O.L.E.C., and ACOG. The discussio ns at these meet ings centered around intelligence issues and strategies. Training All MARTA Police received extensive training on controlling large crowds, Olympic information, bo mb and gas awareness, cultural sensit ivit y, and diplo mat ic procedures. They were informed of their role and how to communicate with the MARTA co mmand post. All po lice supervisors were extensively trained in crowd control procedures and were given table top exercises on how to develop queue and the emergency plans for each rail station. MARTA Police dispatched its Special Operat ions and Rescue Team (SORT) to the Army's Fort McClellan for an intensive training course in bio logical weapons handling to enhance their hazardous materials response capabilit ies. In addit ion, they conducted numerous bus and train assault simulat ions. Emergency Response MARTA has developed an emergency response team. Referred to as the ""Go Team,"" this organizat ion is co mprised of senior individuals fro m MARTA management and operations divisio ns. Its emergency response manuals contain instructions for most foreseeable emergency situat ions. A fully equipped mo bile emergency control center is also available at short notice. Whereas MARTA's Hazmat (SORT) team is capable of providing a first response to a bio logical or chemical attack scene, it does not have the capacit y to deal with an attack on the scale of the Tokyo disaster. If a terrorist campaign consist ing of a series of simultaneous attacks were to be launched, support would be supplied by the Atlanta Fire Department and state and federal authorit ies. The Games progressed well unt il early on Day 9, Saturday, July 27. Shortly after 1:00 a.m., a pipe-bo mb exploded at a Centennial Olympic Park concert, killing one person and injuring scores of others. MARTA and S.O.L.E.C. Police were placed on full alert and all stations were immediately searched for suspicious devices. All on-duty personnel were held over past their shift. During the next few hours numerous alerts were called in, none of which proved true. The alert was eased at 0700, and the extra personnel were released. On two occasions transit stations were briefly clo sed to invest igate suspicious packages in the wake of the Park bombing, but EOD teams responded rapidly and determined there was nothing dangerous in the parcels. Delays in scheduled transportation were minimal. One train was taken out of service for  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   58  MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  approximately two hours after a suspicious device was found by a MARTA emplo yee. It was alleged that the package was thrown onto the train by a man at the airport, who failed to board the train. The train was moved to a pocket track and EOD called. An X-ray of the package was done by EOD and batteries and wires were seen. EOD exploded the package and discovered a flashlight and headphones in the case. Invest igat ion revealed a pilot accidentally left the case on the train at the airport. This was the nearest to sabotage that MARTA experienced during the games and there were only occasional delays due to mechanical problems. CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION ISSUES After the bomb exploded, Centennial Park was closed for the next three days. The Games themselves were unaffected and the park averaged 250,000 visitors per day. Closing of the park seems to have caused a decline in ridership but the venues themselves remained so ld out and people continued to ride MARTA to the events. When Centennial Park reopened on Day 12, July 30, MARTA ridership set new records as people returned to the park. The bo mbing incident had litt le to no effect upon the public's confidence in MARTA. Public Affairs During the Games MARTA made a conscient ious effort to keep the public informed in advance of changes to its service, entry and exit points, and station facilit ies. Augmented Security The New York City Metro-North Railroad Chief of Po lice, Dean Esserman, NYC Transit Securit y Chief, Tom Savage, and other key staff spent several days assist ing MARTA po lice with a crit ique of their crowd management, emergency preparedness, and queue plans. Their knowledge and experience assisted MARTA to prepare detailed crowd flow models and contributed to successes in this area. MARTA's police personnel were augmented during the Olympics with 220 addit ional po lice personnel fro m the state and cit y police forces. In addit ion, MARTA would have been able to call upon support from the National Guard and other sources, had the need arisen. LESSONS LEARNED Overall, MARTA Po lice Services have reason to be proud of their performance. No major incidents occurred within their jurisdict ion and the  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  59  crowds were handled safely and efficient ly. There were many lessons learned, and many theories confirmed, during the Games. A list of them fo llo ws. Advance planning is essential Start early! Put the best people and planners on the job. This is not an area for problem emplo yees or people who are seeking polit ical or social contact. You need hard workers, good communicators, and leaders as Olympic coordinators. Self reliance Be self reliant. Take the responsibilit y for what you know needs to be done, and aggressively pursue these issues unt il you are sure they are resolved. Apply creative thinking Think outside the lines and exercise creativit y. Special or extraordinary events require flexibilit y and, in many instances, deviat ion fro m routine practices. Sound planning and sticking to that plan are essent ial but you must remain flexible and innovat ive when it beco mes necessary. Obtain advice and seek expertise Seek advice fro m experts in the field. Look to people who have ""been there; done that."" Be wary of people who claim to know but have no credent ials. Security is inconvenient It is essent ial that the public and emplo yees are aware that with securit y comes inconvenience. Be prepared to fight for what you know is right in the area of securit y. Anticipate and manage resistance and opposition when you decide to lock facilit ies, enforce securit y regulat ions such as visible I.D. procedures, and ban private vehicles from crit ical areas. Maintain a balance between safety and service disruption More than 140 suspicious packages were reported in the wake of the Centennial Park incident. The MARTA system had to be cleared on two occasions because of suspected packages. During these incidents, the crucial issue proved to be striking a balance between responsible public safet y and service disrupt ion. The advantages in being able to deplo y EOD teams at major sites during large-scale events became evident. This practice expedites response time and investigation and facilitates quick operational recovery. A consequence of these incidents was MARTA's realizat ion of the need to emplo y sniffer dogs and to train its police personnel in bo mb-handling techniques.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   60  MARTA, Atlanta  Shaun P. McCarthy  Crime In general, crimes against persons dropped during the Games alt hough there was a huge increase in pickpocketing incidents. The crowded condit ions were a paradise for this type of crimina l. MARTA was able to enlist the help of some plainclothes Georgia Bureau of Invest igat ion (G.B.I.) agents deplo yed in the Olympic Ring to help address the problem. Even though some arrests were made, the pickpocket problem continued unt il the Games ended. Parking lot crimes did not dramatically increase, despite all parking lots being filled to capacit y. MARTA attributed this pheno mena to the constant flow of people through the lots and to the increased po lice presence at each rail station. Communication Train your personnel well, early, and thoroughly. Keep them informed of plans and object ives. Insure that a good communicat ion network is in place and working. Always keep your personnel advised and informed. Maintain functional responsibility Avo id allo wing personnel to perform cross funct ions. Let the police handle crowd control and station coordinat ion; let rail operations personnel mo ve the trains; and let bus personnel manage buses. Do not confuse the roles; let each area perform their specialt ies. Logistics and morale Take care of emplo yees. Food, water and ""goodies,"" such as special pins and shirts, are very important to emplo yee morale during special events. Final comments One of the securit y problems faced by any large metropolitan transit system is the one-time, big event such as the Olympics, which can push securit y capabilit ies to the limit. While At lanta's transit system, MARTA, was not the target of the bo mbing, other transit organizations can profit fro m the lessons learned while preparing for the event.  Norman Y.

Jenkins Introduction In conjunct ion wit h the Volpe Transportation Systems Center, the Norman Y. Mineta International Inst itute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies at San Jose State Universit y (IISTPS) has been requested to report on the policy framework and best practices current ly in place for combat ing terrorism and major vio lent crimes on surface transportation systems, including public transit. The object ive of this document is to provide an outline of current policies, practices, and procedures for a ""minimum state of readiness."" This outline is neit her conclusive nor exhaust ive, and will cont inue to be developed in subsequent tasks. Project Approach The approach outlined in this document categorizes current policies and practices in three chrono logical categories:    Design and Planning (Pre-Incident Preparedness) Response (Incident Reaction) Recovery (Fo llow-Up)  This outline and project emphasis focus on incident activit y specific to public transit operations and facilit ies. Act ivit ies ident ified in addressing transit vulnerabilit ies are further categorized by t ype and size of operation, specifically problems encountered by mult i-modal s ystems (e.g., rail and bus), large and medium bus-only systems, and small/rural bus systems. The descript ions include specific examples o f the precautions, responses, and recovery measures taken in the event of specific incidents. Policy/Procedures Framework The general framework of preparedness progresses fro m planning and mit igat ion measures through response and recovery. The pre-incident mit igat ion steps incorporate, at a minimum, security and detection devices, environmental design, training, and outreach act ivities. The preparedness step focuses on the inst itutional capacit y and capabilit y o f both internal and external emergency-response organizat ions and teams. This stage also includes:  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   66  Criteria for Transportation Security  Brian M. Jenkins       emergency management and operations planning; direct ion and control; communicat ion (internal and external); and planning for evacuat ion, reporting and support measures.  The response (actual incident) stage is the most visible funct ion in the policy and operational framework. If the mit igat ion and preparedness stages are adequate, this stage is primarily concerned wit h implementation of the policies. Finally, post-incident recovery invo lves the processes necessary to return a situation back to its pre-incident state of operation. It is worth noting that major obstacles to the policy framework include issues such as jurisdict ion over various locales and/or types of events, the costs necessary to develop and sustain emergency programs, and the complexit y and difficult y invo lved in determining an ""acceptable"" level o f risk. These problems, along with numerous others, can make vulnerabilit y management a polit ically salient issue as well as an administrative ""hassle."" One of the biggest issues for any transit agency in developing and implement ing an effect ive ""crisis management"" program, whether it is aimed at criminal act ivit y or natural disasters, is coordinat ion wit h other agencies and organizat ions that are expected to be part of the response scenario. Depending on the magnitude of the problem, these external entit ies may include: Local (community, county, city) organizations/agencies Local law enforcement (police, sheriff) Fire departments, ambulance and emergency medical teams, and related healt h services Search and rescue services Local government emergency management office Red Cross Human services (e.g., crisis counselors) State organizations and agencies State emergency management office Department of Transportation Public safet y National Guard Federal agencies FBI FEMA  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   Criteria for Transportation Security  Brian M. Jenkins  67  Using the research done by Bo yd, Maier and Associates (Perspectives on Transit Security for the 1990s: Strategies for Success), general ""best practices"" that have been identified include, among others: Deployment Practices: Uniformed personnel deplo yment/practices: Deplo yment at fixed posts Random patrolling Directed patrolling Saturation patrols Undercover deplo yment/practices: Directed patrolling Surveillance Stakeouts System Design and Technology Minimizing targets Controlling corridors of movement and egress Effect ive utilization o f provided space Surveillance equipment Zero tolerance signage Data Collection Dispatch logs Operators' reports Incident report forms Operating Practices Route design and scheduling Maintenance System po licies and training Summaries of how these practices are called into play in response to various incidents for a range of service sizes and modes are presented in the fo llowing tables. Note that, while similar practices may be relevant no matter what the size of the transit property, the magnitude of both the problem and the resources available can vary considerably. It should also be crime protection reported that ""du the real thing in d noted that public percept ion can play an important role in and prevent ion. For example, several operators have mmy"" surveillance equipment can be nearly as effective as eterring vandalism and property crimes.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   68  Criteria for Transportation Security  Brian M. Jenkins  Description of Incidents/Problems Law enforcement agencies generally categorize criminal act ivit y under three ""levels"", the latter two of which include the subjects of this analysis: Level 1: Non-vio lent crime: Transit-related incidents include smoking in unauthorized areas, graffit i on vehicles, and avoidance of fare purchase. Level 1 is characterized by minor crimes and vandalism on transportation system equipment and infrastructure, including qualit y-of-life infractions. Level 1 offenses are not discussed in this report. Level 2: Vio lent and destructive crime: These are characterized by assaults on the transit system itself or on operations equipment, personnel, or passengers. Level 3: Premeditated vio lence and destruction: These may be characterized by vio lent attacks or potentially deadly assaults on operators and patrons of the transit system. Impacts may extend beyo nd the physical boundaries of the transit agency property or equipment. In some cases attacks may be polit ically mot ivated and directed against the government or a specific ethnic or racial group. The fo llowing in the order of first three ite securit y/crime 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. is a list of the categories of vio lent crimes extracted from Bo yd, reported severit y (low to high). It should be noted that only the ms are reported to occur in the top half o f 28 ident ified issues:  Objects thrown at vehicles Assaults on passengers Assaults on operators or drivers Weapons offenses Bomb threats Arson Hate crimes Homicides  For purposes of simplicit y, the following categories o f offenses are reported on in this sect ion: A. Crimes against property (includes objects thrown at vehicles, arson, and most hate crimes) B. Crimes against persons (includes assault s on passengers, assault s on operators or drivers, weapons o ffenses, and ho micides) C. Dramat ic impact crimes (includes terrorism, bo mb threats, and some hate crimes).  Norman Y.

Jenkins  103  A CHRONOLOGY OF TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SURFACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 1920-1997 (Including Other Significant Incidents) By Brian M. Jenkins KEY OBSERVATIONS      Terrorist attacks on surface transportation systems have increased over the past 25 years. Bombing (not counting bo mb threats) is the most common tactic and, in the industrialized nat ions, bombing is the deadliest form of attack. Israel has had the most attacks on surface transportation. India and Pakistan head the list as the countries where the most incidents with fatalit ies and deaths overall have occurred. Terrorist attacks on public transportation are often int ended to kill; 35 percent invo lve fatalit ies; more than two-thirds of the attacks are clearly intended to kill. While slaughter is not the primary goal of terrorism, large scale deaths are beco ming an acceptable way of spreading fear, as confirmed by the fact that 80 percent of the attacks on surface transportation with deaths invo lve mult iple fatalit ies and 30 percent of these invo lve 10 or more fatalit ies. Western Europe, North America, and Japan account for 27 percent of the total number of incidents but only nine percent of these incidents invo lve fatalit ies. This indicates that alarm and disruption, and not fatalit ies, are the principle threat faced by industrialized nat ions. However, incidents with large-scale casualt ies have occurred in the industrialized world (i.e., the Bologna train station bo mbing, the attacks on Paris subways, and the Tokyo nerve gas attack.)      Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   104  A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M. Jenkins  INTRODUCTION The fo llowing chrono logy of attacks on surface transportation systems was compiled by the Kroll-O'Gara Company to support an ongoing Depart ment of Transportation-sponsored project to ident ify ""best practices"" in securit y against terrorist attacks on surface transportation. This chrono logy accompanies the first formal report of that study, Protecting Surface Transportation Systems And Patrons from Terrorist Activities. The chrono logy is intended to offer a thorough understanding of the terrorist threat to surface transportation systems by reviewing the incidents that have occurred during the last three-quarters of this century. Entries derive fro m three principal sources: The first is the book, Railway Disasters of the World, (1994) by Peter Semmens.1 Although limited to major rail disasters, this source provides a useful historical background to incidents that occurred before 1968. (Entries fro m this source are indicated by the init ials P S.) The second source is a chrono logy of incidents of internat ional terrorism originally co mpiled by the Rand Corporation as part of its research program on sub-nat ional conflict, and in recent years maintained by the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Polit ical Vio lence at St. Andrews Universit y in Scotland. The author wishes to note the excellent and important research being done and valuable assistance provided by these two inst itutions. The third source is a co mputerized chrono logy of armed conflicts, significant incidents of terrorism, and other major crimes maintained by the Informat ion Services o f the Kroll-O'Gara Company (KINS). The KINS database provided most of the material on the incidents that occurred in the 1990s. All of the informat ion in the chronology originally co mes from public do main sources. No government classified or proprietary informat ion is included and the Department of Transportation provided no input. The chrono logy includes guerrilla attacks, terrorist attacks, and incidents of serious crime where the transportation system or passengers were the principal target. It excludes convent ional warfare (e.g., aerial bo mbings of railroad yards) and acts of wartime sabotage. Admittedly, the boundary between wartime sabotage and guerrilla or terrorist attacks is blurred. Armed conflict is not easily bounded. Guerrilla warfare may ascend to levels approaching convent ional war (e.g., the civil war in Ango la) and terrorists often assert that  1  Peter Semmens, Railway Disasters of the World: Principal passenger train accidents of the 20th century, (Patrick Stephens Limited, Somerset,1994)  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M. Jenkins  105  they legit imately wage war and thus ought not to be separately categorized as terrorists or criminals. On so mewhat arbitrary grounds, the chrono logy includes the IRA's campaign in the United Kingdom, the Palest inian campaign against Israel, and armed assault s and acts of sabotage carried out by guerrillas throughout the developing world. It excludes the historically more distant campaigns conducted by partisans, guerrillas, and resistance fighters in China in the early years o f the century, Spain during the Civil War, Indochina during the first Indochina war, and Algeria during its struggle for independence. Alt hough this chrono logy may at the mo ment be the most complete chronicle of attacks on surface transportation systems, it is certainly not comprehensive. It includes some of the more serious bo mb threats but certainly not the total number of bo mb threats which, for example, averaged 50 a week in France fo llo wing the detonation of a terrorist bomb in the Paris subways. It cannot possibly include all o f the incidents of sabotage that have occurred during periods of labor strife. It should be seen as broadly representative of the threat. The chrono logy lists 631 incidents. Some of these include mult iple events, i.e., bomb threats or bombings. As a result, and in so me cases owing to inco mplete informat ion requiring judgments about categories, the numbers indicated in the fo llowing charts may not precisely match. The entries include threats and attacks on trains and subways, train and subway stations and the rails themselves, buses and bus terminals, bridges and tunnels, and other transportation targets. (See Figure 2-1, Targets) The incidents are almost equally divided between attacks on rail transportation (trains, subways, stations, and rails) and bus transport (buses and terminals).  Norman Y.

Jenkins  Figure 2-1 Targets Targets of Attacks on Public Surface Transportation Systems (1920  1997)  Figure 2-2 Tactics Used against Surface Transportation Systems (1920  1997)  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M. Jenkins  107  Bombing is the most commo n tactic, account ing for 61 percent of the attacks. This is generally true of terrorism overall. Ambushes and armed assaults account for 10 percent of the attacks. These include incidents when guerrillas or terrorists set up road blocks, ambush buses, derail or block trains, and then murder passengers. Seven percent of the incidents are standoff attacks when guerrillas or terrorists fire rockets, machineguns, or rifles at passing trains or buses. Five percent invo lve hostage situations and four percent mechanical sabotage, usually against rails. (See figure 2-2, Tactics.) Are terrorist attacks on surface transportation increasing? They appear to be. However, the increase is difficult to quantify precisely and it is not as dramat ic as the totals for the most recent years suggest. The chronology lists only 17 incidents for the period 1920 to 1970, a growing number of incidents in the 1970s and 1980s (217 attacks for the period) reflect ing the overall increase in terrorist activit y during this time. There is a significant jump in the 1990s when 312 attacks are recorded in the five years from 1991 to 1995 and 118 attacks are recorded for the 18 months from January 1996 to June 1997. However, much of this rise is due to the differences in criteria which governed the original sources used in the compilat ion o f the chronology. The first 50 years of this chronology derive exclusively fro m Peter Semmens' Railway Disasters of the World which focused on incidents invo lving significant casualt ies and excluded attacks on bus systems. Entries for the next two decades derive mostly fro m the Rand Corporation's chronology, which includes only incidents of internat ional terrorism, that is, incidents where terrorists have crossed nat ional front iers to carry out attacks or have attacked foreign targets within their own country. It thus excludes attacks on indigenous targets by local terrorists. More complete recording co mes fro m the Kroll-O'Gara database which covers the 1990s and includes all significant attacks: terrorist and criminal, trans-nat ional and local. Nonetheless, we have seen an increase in attacks on public transportation as terrorism has increased over the past quarter century and more recently as terrorists have demonstrated greater willingness to kill indiscriminately. The Irish Republican Army's lo ng-running terrorist campaign in the United Kingdo m has included numerous attacks on rail lines, trains, subways, and stations. Palest inian terrorists have carried out numerous attacks on Israeli buses and bus stations. Algerian extremists directed their 1995 terrorist campaign in France against the subway and rail system. The first large-scale terrorist use of chemical weapons was carried out in Tokyo's subways, an ideal environment for chemical attack. Islamic extremists in New York planned to attack the cit y's bridges and tunnels in 1993 and its subways in 1997.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   108  A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M. Jenkins  These events clearly indicate that contemporary terrorists have made public transportation a new theater of operations. For those determined to kill in quant it y and willing to kill indiscriminately, public transportation offers an ideal target. It is public, used by millio ns of people daily. There is necessarily litt le securit y with no obvious chokepoints (like those at airports) to inspect passengers and parcels. The passengers are strangers promising attackers anonymit y and easy escape. Concentrations of people in contained environments are especially vulnerable to convent ional explo sives and unconvent ional weapons. Also, attacks on public transportation, the circulatory systems of urban environments, cause great disruption and alarm which are the tradit ional goals of terrorism. The statist ics support the observat ion that terrorists see public transportation systems as a killing field. Most terrorist vio lence is symbo lic, intended to cause alarm rather than casualt ies. Historically, only about 20 percent of all internat ional terrorist incidents have invo lved fatalit ies, although that figure has risen in recent years, reflect ing an erosion of the self-imposed constraints that tradit ionally limited terrorist mayhem. In contrast, more than 35 percent of the attacks on surface transportation systems invo lve fatalit ies and more than two-thirds of the attacks clearly were intended to kill. Serious injuries were caused when bo mbs went off in crowded passenger terminals and when speeding trains were derailed. The reporting has been generous in the definit ion o f incidents not clearly intended to kill: these incidents include bo mb threats, attacks on property, sabotage of rails and bridges where no crash occurred, all hostage situations where no one died, and bo mbs defused because a warning may have been given. When in doubt, the incident was counted as not intended to kill. Further evidence of the rise in vio lence is provided by the proportion of incidents with mult iple fatalit ies. (See Figure 2-3 Total Incidents With Fatalities) For terrorism in general, the vast majorit y o f all fatal terrorist attacks invo lve a single death, although again, in recent years, the proportion of incidents with mult iple fatalit ies has moved upward, reflecting terrorists' growing willingness to escalate their vio lence. However, more than 80 percent of the attacks on surface transportation with any fatalit ies invo lve two or more deaths, and 30 percent invo lve 10 or more deaths. The median fatal incident invo lves four deaths and the deadliest incidents more than 100 deaths.  Norman Y.

Jenkins  109  Figure 2-3 Total Incidents With Fatalit ies On Public Surface Transportation Systems (1920  1997)  Figure 2-4 The Deadliest Cases (25 or more fatalit ies) of Attacks on Public Transportation Systems (11920  1997)  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   110  A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M. Jenkins  How do the deadliest incidents occur? Armed assaults on trains, that is, when a train is derailed or sabotaged and the passengers are attacked and killed, account for the two deadliest incidents in the chrono logy. Bombs on trains are the most frequent cause of incidents with 25 or more fatalit ies, fo llowed by train derailments and armed assaults on buses. (See Figure 2-4, The Deadliest Cases) Armed assaults on trains or buses are a feature of rural guerrilla warfare. They are not likely to occur in the industrialized nat ions or in urban areas where the deadliest threat comes fro m bombs. This difference is borne out by examining where the most fatalit ies have occurred: India, Pakistan, Cambodia, Ango la, and Israel head the list. (See Figure 2-5 Countries With the Most Fatalities) The areas where the most incidents with fatalit ies occur gives a similar picture: India, Pakistan, Israel, Algeria, and Egypt are at the top. (See Figure 2-6, Location of Attacks With Fatalities) Israel ranks high in both lists due to the deadly campaign of terrorist bo mbings on buses and in bus terminals. Israel also heads the list in suffering the most attacks overall fo llowed by India, the United Kingdo m, Pakistan, and Egypt. The United Kingdo m's record reflects the IRA's terrorist campaign, which includes numerous incidents of sabotage, bomb threats, and bo mbs with warnings but few incidents with fatalit ies. This data reflects the general pattern for the countries of Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Although a total of 176 attacks are recorded for these countries in the chrono logy, represent ing 27 percent of the total number of incidents, only 20 of the incidents since 1970 invo lve fatalit ies. (See Figure 2-6 Location of Attacks With Fatalities) The median number of fatalit ies in the industrialized nat ions is two. This suggests that the threat faced by the industrialized nat ions is primarily one of alarm and disrupt ion, the tradit ional goals of terrorism, and not deaths. It also suggests that it will be difficult to make persuasive arguments for costly and potentially disrupt ive securit y measures unless these are abso lutely necessary and promise to be effect ive in prevent ing even costlier and more disrupt ive interruptions of service. These measures must also contribute significant ly to reducing ordinary crime, or must be psycho logically and polit ically necessary to reassure an alarmed public that something is being done.

Jenkins  At the same time as we have witnessed large-scale attacks in the industrialized countries (84 killed in a train station in Italy; an alarming first use of chemical warfare in Tokyo's subway); we have seen thwarted plots, narrow misses, and fortunate outcomes like the fo iled plan to detonate truck bombs in New York's tunnels, the discovery of a potential suicide bo mbing in New York's subways, and the derailment of a speeding passenger train in which only one person died. These are dangerous indicators of future trends. The challenge will be to define the appropriate level o f securit y against such statist ically rare but high consequence events. It is a recurring problem in dealing with terrorism.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M.

India - October 7, 1920 - Train derailed by disgruntled workers The ""Madras-Bangalore Mail"" train was derailed by disgrunt led workers, who removed a section of the railroad. Thirteen people were killed and 15 others were injured in the incident. (PS) India - July 8, 1920 - Train derails killing 25 people, injuring 60 others On July 8, a train was derailed in Belur result ing in 25 deaths and at least 60 injuries. It was the eighth sabotage attempt on the Indian railways in recent months. (PS) China - December 27, 1930 - Train sabotaged near Beijing On December 27, bandits caused the explosio n of the bo iler of a train on the south-west Manchuria railroad, causing 80 deaths and many other injuries. The bandit s robbed the train and kidnapped 20 passengers for ransom. (PS) Hungary - September 13, 1931 - Train attack kills 25 people On September 13, a bomb exploded on an international express train en route from Budapest to Vienna, Austria, killing 25 people on board. A note found near the explosio n site stated, ""Brother Proletarians. If the capitalist state cannot provide work, we shall get it ourselves. We have plent y o f petrol and explosives."" (PS) India - January 12, 1939 - Train sabotaged, 21 people killed On January 12, the ""Dehra Dun Express"" train from Howrah was sabotaged when missing rail tracks caused the train to derail, result ing in 21 deaths and 71 injuries. Two more attempts against the railways were staged in the fo llo wing two months, and a total of 131 incidents of wrecking or attempted wrecking was reported in the previous 10 years. (PS) United States - August 12, 1939 - Saboteurs derail train, killing 24 people The Unio n Pacific Railroad's streamlined express, ""Cit y of San Francisco"", was derailed while traveling at 60 miles per hour, 16 miles west of Carlin,  Norman Y.

(PS) India - April 26, 1966 - Naga tribesmen bomb another train In a similar attack to the one on April 20, Naga tribesmen bo mbed a train near the borders of Nagaland, killing 39 people and injuring so me 60 others. (PS) Germany - February 10, 1970 - Grenade attack on bus at Munich airport' Three Arab terrorists killed an Israeli cit izen and wounded 11 other Israeli passengers in a grenade attack on a bus at the Munich airport. The three were arrested. Two Palest inian organizat ions -- the PFLP and the AOLP -- were responsible for the attack. The terrorists were set free after the September 6, 1970, hijacking of one Swiss and two U.S. airliners. Israel - February 23, 1970 - Guerrillas ambush tourist bus Guerrillas ambushed a tourist bus near the occupied town of Hebron in the West Bank and killed an American wo man. Israel - November 6, 1970 - Bombing at the central bus station in Tel Aviv A bomb exploded in the central bus station in Tel Aviv, fo llowed by another explosio n there 20 minutes later.

The IRA was responsible for  Bombing at Victoria Station in London, injuring four people. A a warning four minutes before the the attack.  United Kingdom - February 3, 1974 - Bombing on bus kills 11 people A 50-pound bo mb that was apparently concealed in a suitcase smashed a bus which was carrying so ldiers and their families back from leave to their camp in Count y Durham, as the bus was traveling through Yorkshire. Eleven people were killed and 14 injured. Officials in London attributed the attack to the IRA. United Kingdom - April 6, 1974 - Bombing in railway station, shops Blasts attributed to the IRA damaged an o ffice building and railway station in Birmingham, England, and stores in suburban London, and injured two policemen in Manchester. Austria - April 17, 1974 - Bomb threat on train bound for Rome Vienna po lice received an anonymous call fro m a man claiming to represent the ""Justice Guerrillas"" with a message that radioactive material had been placed aboard a brain bound for Rome. Police found a substantial but not lethal amount of radioactive material, Iodine 131, under the seat of a firstclass co mpartment of the Vienna-Ro me Express in Vienna. There were no threats made to life or property. The contaminat ion was suspected to be the result of an unattended shipment by a Vienna drug company o f medical Iodine 131 which was intended for a hospital in Linz for use in medical diagnosis. It was reported missing after the railroad car was contaminated. This shipment, consist ing of three packages, remained unattended on a baggage truck in Vienna main railroad station for approximately two hours on April 12, in spite of exist ing regulat ions for safe handling of radioact ive material. It is not clear fro m the sketchy reports on the incident whether the packages were marked to indicate their contents. The incident attracted widespread publicit y. Hoax callers wit h threats caused alerts, and these brought about delays as Geiger counter checks were made of trains leaving Vienna. On April 22, the Austrian police offered a reward for the capture of the ""Just ice Guerrillas."" They later announced the arrest of an individual wit h a history of mental illness. His actions, he said, were meant to be a protest against the treatment of mentally ill pat ients in Austrian hospitals. The polit ical consequences appear to have been minimal.  Norman Y.

United Kingdom - October 9, 1975 - Bomb explosion kills 1 person, injures 20 A bomb exploded near a bus stop at the entrance to Green Park subway station in London, causing one death and 20 injuries. The IRA was held responsible for the attack. Netherlands - December 2, 1975 - Armed extremists kill passengers and take hostage on train Seven armed extremists, calling themselves the ""Free South Moluccan Youths"" and demanding independence for the Indonesian Island of South Molucca, seized a passenger train near Beilen in the Northern Netherlands, killing at least three people and taking about 64 hostages. Twenty-six o f the original 64 hostages either escaped or were released, leaving a total of 38 hostages on the Beilen train. The terrorists demanded a bus to Schipho l airport near Amsterdam, and a plane to fly them to an unknown dest inat ion. Later, in another note, they demanded the release of five Mo luccans held in Dutch prisons on charges of terrorist actions, and Dutch recognit ion of what they called their ""government in exile."" An explo sio n aboard the hijacked train injured one of the extremists and slight ly wounded a passenger hostage. The young Asian terrorists surrendered to police on December 14, releasing the remaining hostages after a 12-day siege of the train. The terrorists were tried and sentenced to 14 years in prison.  Norman Y. Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies   118  A Chronology of Terrorist Attacks  Brian M. Jenkins  In an apparent ly separate coordinated terrorist action by South Moluccans in their struggle for an East Indian ho meland, six armed South Moluccans shot their way into the Indonesian Consulate in central Amsterdam and took a reported 47 persons hostage. At least three consulate staffers were injured by gunfire or fell as they climbed out of consulate windows and down a rope fro m the roof of the building in order to escape. One consular official, injured when he jumped fro m an upper floor, died later in a hospital. Three other staffers inside the consulate were believed wounded in the init ial gunfire. The last of 16 children originally captured in the consulate school were released on December 8 by the South Moluccans in return for certain concessio ns, leaving 27 adult hostages in the building. Gunmen at both sites, the Indonesian Consulate and the Beilen train hijacked on December 2, sought independence for the Moluccan Island group ruled by Ho lland for nearly three centuries, and present ly part of Indonesia, the release of 25 comrades in Dutch jails, and safe passage.

The cause of the guerrilla war is apparent ly a Moslem revo lt against the Soviet backed government of President Nur Mohammed Taraki. Israel - November 2, 1979 - Passenger train explosion An explosio n under the engine of an Israeli passenger train ripped up a sect ion of track but caused no injuries. The engineer managed to bring the train safely into Tel Aviv; if the train had derailed, it would have plunged into a river. Police blamed Palest inian guerrillas.

Jenkins  France - March 29, 1982 - Bomb exploded on train, killing five passengers A high explosive tore up the second coach of the Paris -Toulouse express, killing five passengers and injuring 27 others. The police believed the explo sion was caused eit her by a deliberately set bomb or by explosives being transported clandest inely. The engineer was able to stop the train without a derailment; then the train proceeded slowly to Limoges where the injured were taken off the train. No claim for responsibility was received fro m any terrorist group operating in France. In the absence of other evidence, the press and public probably linked the incident with terrorist Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez, known internat ionally as Carlos, who had threatened a campaign against France if co lleagues of his were not released from prison. On March 31, the ultra-right ist group opposed to the Basque separat ists, the Spanish Basque Battalio n (BBE), said it carried out the bomb attack. An anonymous telephone caller told the daily DEIA that the BBE ""would attack in France every t ime that the military wing of the ETA (Basque Autonomous Movement) carried out an attack in Spain."" According to DEIA, extreme right groups in Spain frequent ly claim that ETA milit ants carry out terrorist attacks against police and army o fficers and then obtain refuge in southern France. The police do not consider the claim credible since the group has often made unfounded claims. Some other groups, such as the Terrorist Internationale, the Delta Commandos (far right) and the far-left mo vement called the Groupe Bakounine-Gdansk-Paris-Guatemala-Salvador also claimed responsibilit y for the attack on the ""Capito le."" One claim was from the ""Friends o f Carlos"", and though it was no more credible than other claims, the possibilit y that Carlos might really have been invo lved was not ruled out. Lebanon - April 30, 1982 - Embassy official's car hijacked A U.S. embassy official had his car hijacked by gunmen in the largely Moslem west Beirut area. United Kingdom - August 11, 1982 - Bombing at railroad A freight train was slight ly damaged when a bomb exploded on a sect ion of the main railroad in Count y Armagh, Northern Ireland. Train services were disrupted due to the incident. China - October 1, 1982 - Man attempted to hijack tourist bus A man carrying what he claimed was a bo mb tried to flee the mainland by attempt ing to hijack a buslo ad of tourists and use them as hostages to get a plane flight to Taiwan.

A PLO communiqu related that the attack had been made against troops along a military road leading to Tel Aviv. It said that the attack had resulted in the killing or wounding of all the occupants of the bus. Israeli spokesmen, however, had said the attack had been mounted on a civilian bus in Tel Aviv and that 12 civilians were injured. No deaths were reported. France - July 28, 1983 - ASALA threats against French government ASALA threatened more attacks against French territory and government organizat ions.

In fact, EMPG is the only line item in the FEMA budget that has not received an increase during that time. The National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), which is comprised of emergency management directors from the states and territories, has requested that Congress provide FEMA with additional funding for state and local emergency management programs in the Spring Fiscal Year 2002 supplemental appropriations bill. The request is that $200 million be added to the Emergency Management Performance Grant Program (EMPG) in the 2002 FEMA budget to address unmet needs and to assist in capacity building, and that appropriate annual increases in EMPG funding continue until it has reached the intended 50/50 match. A recent NEMA survey revealed total program support needs in the amount of $2.1 billion. The $200 million urgent request is based on responses from 38 states to address near term requirements, and will almost assuredly increase when the remaining state data is received.  In Colorado, forty-seven jurisdictions and the state office of emergency management benefit from the EMPG program with a statewide reimbursement rate of approximately 27 percent of eligible expenses. Additional federal funding needed to bring all articipating jurisdictions up to the 50 percent level was $834,366 in federal fiscal year 2001. An estimated additional $375,000 would be needed to fund jurisdictions not currently participating in the EMPG program, bringing Colorados annual unmet needs to $1.2 million. The history of the current EMPG system of funding state and local governments has its roots in the Civil Defense initiatives of World War II and the Cold War. The collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War lead to reduced funding for expanded programs even though the same funding system was kept in place. It remains to be seen whether the efforts of NEMA, and perhaps other professional emergency management associations, can prevail upon the Congress for additional funding to build local capacity.  Vol. 8, No. 2 Spring 2002   Prepared  by Steve Douglas President, Colorado Emergency Management Assosciation (CEMA); Director, Pueblo County Emergency Management  T  he concept of multi-tasking isnt hard for any emergency manager to grasp. It is as embedded in our everyday lives as that of shifting priorities. The events on and after September 11, 2001 have placed added emphasis on those two terms. They have placed an even stronger emphasis on the value of integrated, allhazards emergency management and on networking  otherwise known as teamwork. Just keeping up with the daily mail (voice-mail, e-mail and old fashioned snail mail) regarding new initiatives, new grant opportunities and new expectations, as well as the routine work (emergencies included) can become overwhelming. Help may be on the way in terms of new paid staff and/or more volunteers, but those things dont happen overnight and they dont just fall out of the sky without someones (yours, mine and/or someone elses) effort. So, if the load is starting to feel a bit heavy, it may be because we have forgotten about each other as resources  through networking and teamwork. Here are a few ways to tap into a Colorado network of emergency managers and other good people doing related work: n The Colorado Office of Emergency Management (COEM) maintains a list of Colorados Sheriffs and Emergency Managers including names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses. n COEM also provides a weekly Information Report, which is a one-page summary of current emergency management-related events, trainings, and opportunities. Material included can come from each of us. So, if you have timely material to share, please provide it to Polly White at polly.white@state.co.us. n The COEM web site, www.dola.state.co.us/oem/ oemindex.htm, is a library of, and gateway to a wide range of emergency management-related information, including but not limited to the two items mentioned above. I recommend review and use of the site. It can save each of us hours of searching and can also help us avoid continually reinventing the wheel  i.e., draw from the work and experience of others.  n The Colorado Governors 2002 Emergency Management Conference is scheduled for August 20-21 in Denver. The agenda is nearly finalized, and includes input from many of you. It, and other conference data, will be posted on the COEM web site soon. This is an excellent opportunity to meet and network with emergency managers from across the state. n The 2002 Colorado Mitigation & Wildfire Conference is September 27-29 in Longmont. This conference is now on an 18-month cycle. It provides a unique and valuable opportunity for fire officials, Sheriffs, County Commissioners, emergency managers, land use and environmental planners, among others to learn from each other. A draft agenda and conference information is available on line at www.wildfirecolorado.org. n The Colorado Emergency Management Association (CEMA) offers other opportunities to network. It maintains a web page nested within the COEM site at www.dola.state.co.us/oem/Cema/CEMA.htm. CEMAs annual meeting will be held over lunch on day two (August 21) of the Colorado Governors 2002 Emergency Management Conference. The 2002 CEMA Presidents Award for outstanding contributions to emergency management in Colorado will be presented at the meeting. Nominations for the award may be sent to me at The Pueblo County Department of Emergency Management, 320 West 10th Street B1, Pueblo, Colorado 81003-2995. The deadline for nominations is July 20. Elections for the offices of President and Treasurer will be held as the meetings last item of business. Sample ballots and nomination forms have been sent to CEMA members. The meeting agenda will be sent to all members before the meeting, and will be posted on the CEMA web page. Visitors are welcome at the annual meeting. We are pretty good at reaching out, networking and working as a team when faced with a major emergency or full-blown disaster. We can be even more effective in those challenging times if we practice those skills every day. Above are examples of where, when and how to do that. If you have other suggestions, please share them. Thank you and have a great day!  Page 2  Colorado OEM  Spring 2002   Prepared This was followed with a tabletop exercise in October to discuss how to handle recovery if impacted by a large tornado. On March 13, the group was brought together for a presentation from Greg Moser, COEMs counter terrorism expert. The message was about WMD and terrorism truths, fears, and how Colorado is preparing. This was very informative and well received. On May 31, another tabletop exercise is scheduled involving a terrorist attack We will test our plans, call down lists, and knowledge. Those of us in the first responder community realize there are two things which seem to fall apart on any large, multi-agency incident; communications and incident management. We have seen this in recent events and are actively addressing the issue. The Incident Command System (ICS) is a management system that if used properly will help in managing these two problems. The key here is we all must understand ICS, train, and exercise with it. The ICS is modular in structure and can be used for large or small incidents, emergency or non-emergency. It is built on having a communications plan, a unified command structure if more than one agency is involved, and resource and personnel management. This is happening. Most of the police and sheriffs office people are either trained or are being trained. Are we ready? Some would say no, but I say we are far more ready than most of the country. Sure we have a ways to go and were working on it. The training and planning for a terrorism event never stops, but neither does the plans for a natural disaster. We have a potential for severe weather, man-made disasters with all the nasty hazardous materials transported on the highways and railroads, storage facilities and businesses and possible air crashes, all of which could shut the county down. We dont have tidal waves, and if we do, that means California has finally slid into the Ocean. The key here is to realize that although terrorism is on everyones minds, we plan for disasters everyday. The County Emergency Operations Plan is put together with an all hazards perspective. Sure there are differences between a terrorist attack and other disasters, but will we respond  absolutely! Keep in mind that what you see on the television or get from the media may sensationalized to make an impact. Think about it, learn about it, stay smart about it, and dont panic. As weve heard before. terrorism wages war between your ears and the battle is won and lost there. Increase your knowledge, prepare yourself and your family, and know what to do if youre faced with a disaster.  I  by Lt. Roger Hoffner, Arapahoe County Emergency Management Coordinator  f you read the newspapers or listen to the radio you might get the impression Colorado and local governments havent been, and are not doing anything to prepare for a terrorist attack. My perspective is that this couldnt be further from the truth. For at least the past two years, long before 9-11, the Colorado Office of Emergency Management (COEM) and local governments have been planning and preparing. The Arapahoe Countys Office of Emergency Management (ACOEM) has been an integral part of this process. I have been the Emergency Management Coordinator for six years and have attended many classes on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. Ive established a terrorist annex for the County Emergency Operations Plan as have 56 of the 64 counties in Colorado. One hundred percent of the public health agencies in Colorado have completed assessments relating to health capabilities and needs. Almost two years ago I learned of grant money that was to be available to counties for first responders and hazmat teams. A county assessment listing targets, vulnerabilities, capabilities and needs was required to apply. With permission, Douglas County was included in a regional assessment and application. In August 2001, Arapahoe/ Douglas Counties were awarded $352,000, but the money would take time to get from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to the state and then county. Although this was about $550,000 short of the listed assessment needs, it was a great start. The ACOEM planned to put together a First Responders Bag for law enforcement in both counties. After 9-11, a request was made to DOJ through COEM to expedite $113,000 for the Bags. Once approved, 805 were put together and distributed to all the law enforcement agencies in Arapahoe and Douglas counties. Since that time, the ACOEM has given 32 additional bags to Colorado State Patrol at the Castle Rock office. The bags contain: chemical/ biological gas mask, three different kinds of gloves, goggles, disposable respirators, eye wash, ear plugs, chemical suit with hood, overshoe booties and duct tape. In November 2000, the COEM coordinated an Integrated Emergency Management Course in Emmittsburg Maryland at the Emergency Management Institute. There were 79 leaders, mostly from Arapahoe County, including three County Commissioners who made the trip and experienced the realistic exercise and training. Since that time, there has been a commitment to continue the training with this group. In 2001, there was a general meeting to discuss what we had learned and where we wanted to go.  Spring 2002  Colorado OEM  Page 3   Prepared  by Duane Freeman, Delta County Emergency Preparedness Coordinator  A  five-county area on the western slope is in the process of adopting the emergency preparedness network (EPN) system offered by Qwest and Intrado. Intrado is a company under contract from Qwest that handles the enhanced 911 database. The EPN system offers a unique telephone emergency notification system for incidents such as floods, fires and other emergencies. The five counties are Delta, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Montrose and Ouray. Each has signed or is in the process of signing an agreement for the system. The five-county agreement results in significant cost savings for each county. A kick-off date for planning will be set when all agreements are in place. Training will be set-up for counties to map preplanned areas within the system and to train dispatchers. The EPN is a rapid and broad reaching telephone emergency notification service. The EPN provides emergency notification by actively placing telephone calls to inform citizens of an impending danger. In the event of a disaster, an authorized pubic safety official can request deployment of EPN. Within minutes, hundreds or thousands of calls can simultaneously reach affected citizens to deliver warnings and critical safety instructions. EPN employs a strictly controlled database of geographically coded subscriber telephone numbers and addresses. When emergencies arise, Qwests EPN identifies those telephone numbers within the specified geographic area designated by the appropriate public safety official. Based on a 30-second message length, up to 2,000 emergency messages per minute can be automatically delivered. Examples of areas that can be preplanned for emergencies are the Gunnison River in Gunnison and Delta Counties, and the Uncompahgre River in Ouray, Montrose, and Delta Counties. Other local floodways can also be mapped and preplanned for emergencies. Dynamic real-time event boundaries can be programmed by mapping wildfires as they threaten homes and communities.  San Migial County plans to be added to the EPN providing for a six-county area. The six-county area has been set up as a regional planning area and representatives of the counties along with those of state and federal agencies meet quarterly in Montrose to discuss such things as emergency incidents, training schedules, exercises, grant programs, mutual aid agreements, radio systems, and 911 systems. The five-county Emergency Preparedness Network is an example of Colorado counties working together to provide coordinated public safety and service for its citizens and achieving significant cost savings in the process.  T  he National Weather Service and the Colorado Office of Emergency Management have again partnered to make Colorado Severe Weather Awareness Week (April 7-13) and Lightning and Wildfire Awareness Week (April 28-May 4) a huge success. The agencies provided activities and public education to interested residents and National Weather Service professionals conducted training in weather spotting. Many local emergency management agencies conducted activities throughout the weeks to raise local awareness. The Governors proclamations declaring the awareness weeks may be viewed on the Colorado Office of Emergency Management website.  Greek and Roman temples often were erected at sites where lightning struck. The Gods were worshipped there as an attempt to appease them.  Page 4  Colorado OEM  Spring 2002   Prepared  by Greg Moser, Colorado Office of Emergency Management  T  he Front Range Regional Emergency Trauma Advisory Committee (RETAC) recently sponsored a tabletop and large-scale field exercise for responding to a mass casualty incident involving a railroad. The exercise was based on the derailment of a passenger train on the line between Boulder and the Moffat Tunnel. The exercise was hosted by Gilpin County with participating agencies from Boulder, Jefferson, Clear Creek and Grand counties. The Colorado Office of Emergency Management and Colorado State Patrol also participated in the planning and conduct of these training events. Private sector participation was invaluable with both AMTRAK and the Union Pacific Railroad providing both resources and participants. Qwest and WorldCom, whose transmission lines are often on railroad right of ways, also  In addition to a broad range of local and state response resources, AMTRAK and the Winter Park Ski Train provided passenger cars to support the exercise. AMTRAK and Union Pacific personnel also provided training on safety considerations for first responders when working around railroads and trains. First responders were familiarized with accessing trains and other unique aspects of railroad resources and operations. This training also highlighted the electrical and hazardous materials aspects of responding to rail disasters. Twenty-three simulated victims were moulaged to simulate various degrees of injury and provide responders with a variety of challenges, including removal of victims from a railcar. This was the third large-scale regional exercise in which Colorado OEM and other state agencies have participated in the last year. Earlier regional exercises in the San Luis Valley and at Blue Mesa Reservoir were clear demonstrations of the importance or regional response to large-scale man-made or natural disasters. If your community is interested in having COEM involvement in exercise development, please contact your regional planner or Bob Wold at 303.272-1778.  participated. The tabletop exercise was held at the Gilpin County Justice Center on April 27th. Approximately 65 first responders, emergency managers, elected officials, and private sector representatives participated in this 6-hour training event. A large-scale model of the Moffat Tunnel was use with a table map and scale model vehicles to simulate a field exercise in a classroom environment. Representatives from the Colorado Office of Emergency Management provided a lead in for the exercise that was facilitated by several members of the RETAC. This phase of the training focused on communications, coordination, and resource management. Emphasis was also placed on the use of the Incident Command System to support multi-agency/multi-jurisdictional response. Larry Stern, Boulder OEM, facilitated the exercise critique. The field exercise was held at the eastern portal of the Moffat Tunnel on May 5th. Forty-seven agencies provided 187 participants for this event.  Spring 2002  Colorado OEM  Page 5   Prepared Students will learn how to identify the critical business processes that must continue through a disruption or disaster and learn about survivability issues for an organization. The students will also learn how to obtain much of the basic planning information and advice from public and private sector sources. The course development team is composed of Tony Mendes (FEMA), Bob Kistner (Energy Planning Consultants, Inc.), Rich Huggins (Huggins & Associates), Robert Niehoff (BCP Advisors), Dr. Floyd Shoemaker (FEMA, retired), Lynn Overstreet (retired), Dave Weiss (Weiss Insurance Agency), and Ivo Roospold (Red Rocks Community College).  S            ince 1999 Red Rocks Community College, in Lakewood Colorado, has been offering emergency management training via the INTERNET. Students can take a course without the need for long distance travel and can set their own schedule. Since INTERNET courses dont have a set classroom time, students can participate at any hour....the school is now coming to the student. Ten core Emergency Management and Planning courses, representing 30 credit hours, are currently available. The current course offerings include: Principles of Emergency Management, Emergency Planning, Developing Volunteer Resources, Exercise Design and Evaluation, Leadership and Influence, Decision Making and Problem Solving, Effective Communication, Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Management and Operations, Incident Command System (ICS), and Public Information Officer (PIO).  All of these public-sector oriented courses are based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) curriculum and supported by the Colorado Office of Emergency Management. The emergency management discipline has gained new recognition with the September 11th attack and the need for a business-oriented emergency management program was graphically demonstrated by the impact to, and destruction of so many private companies. With this in mind, Red Rocks is developing a basic businessoriented course which has been missing from Red Rocks popular public sector-oriented emergency management offerings. With the development of this course, Red Rocks will close the loop. This Introductory Course is being developed in conjunction with the Association of Contingency Planners and support from the Colorado Office of Emergency Management and FEMA, and uses the current national consensus standard. This course will be available for the fall 2002 semester. The course is an introduction to the emergency management field for all sizes of businesses as well as a foundation to more specialized courses. It provides a complete, basic program for the small business and the typical part-time, under-resourced emergency program coordinator who wears many other hats.  G  by Jo Ann Stone, Gunnison County Emergency Services  unnison County has just completed their dedicated Emergency Operations Center located in the basement of the courthouse. The EOC also serves as the conference room for the Communications Board, the LEPC, 911 Board and as a meeting room for other vital county agencies. The EOC is hooked up to the system used by the City of Gunnison, Gunnison County and to other internet services. The EOC will also be used as as an Incident Command Center for those appropriated incidents. Gunnison County Commissiocers have been very proactive in preparing for emergencies and this is just another example of these preparations. Gunnison, Delta, Montrose, and Ouray Counties have just signed the contract for Reverse 911 (story on page 4) which should be very beneficial during an active wildfire season as well as any other potential hazard. The county also just completed a Hazardous Materials Operations Class. Twenty-four students completed this course which will add to the numbers of members who volunteer for their Hazardous Materials Response team. Gunnison County just completed the Ops Center Software class. This class was taught by Matt Coldwell of Colorado State Patrol at the Western State College Computer lab and was attended by every law enforcement agency within Gunnison and Hinsdale Counties as well as Public Works, Finance, EMS, Fire, Public Health and Emergency Management agencies.  Page 6  Colorado OEM  Spring 2002   Prepared  by Larry Stern, Boulder Office of Emergency Management  R  ecently, the City of Boulder purchased Barker Dam and Reservoir from XCELL Energy. A hydroelectric plant was part of the deal. The Dam, Reservoir, and Hydro come under regulations of FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). FERC requires that; tabletop, functional, and full-scale exercises be held as part of the regulations.  nder the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, new rules were promulgated to facilitate implementation of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and the new Mitigation Planning requirements. Under the new rules, communities interested in obtaining mitigation funds through the new FEMA PreDisaster Mitigation Program or the existing Hazard Mitigation Grant Program are requested to do local hazard mitigation plans. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is triggered by presidential disaster declarations. The program has been triggered three times in the past ten years: 1997, 1999, and 2001. The State of Colorado received approximately $3.5 million for mitigation projects after those disasters. Response has been exceptional. Over 30 communities have expressed interest in participating in the process. The new PreDisaster Mitigation Program may be viewed as a next phase to Project Impact. Under Project Impact, communities did local hazard analyses and planning to select viable mitigation projects. This year the state received approximately $351,000 to assist local governments with mitigation planning efforts. Earlier this year the state asked local governments if they were interested in completing multi-hazard mitigation plans. Response has been exceptional. Over 30 communities (counties and cities) have expressed interest in participating in the process. We will work with these communities toward developing these plans. Plans will have to be adopted by local jurisdictions and then approved by FEMA to be eligible for federal mitigation funds. FEMA contractors are developing aids and guidance to assist local communities with this effort. The Colorado Office of Emergency Management and FEMA will provide technical and financial assistance to assist communities.  U  by Marilyn Gally, Colorado OEM  On Thursday, May 9, 2002, the functional exercise was held at Boulder s City Yards. Most city departments participated as well as our office. The scenario included: 15 inches of predicted rain (3 inches produce a 100 year flood in Boulder Canyon); the National Earthquake Center in Golden confirmed a minor earthquake occurrence in the area of Barker Dam; 80,120 CFS (cubic feet per second) water flow into the reservoir was predicted (12,000 cfs produces a 100 year flood); the Dam was predicted to overflow 10 feet above the spillway for a period of 14 hours (causing the dam to fail); and the National Weather Service issued a Flood Warning for Boulder County. Thus began the exercise. Well, we immediately evacuated for a 2000 year flood event by using 911 callback, cable interrupt, Alert system, EAS, notified State OEM, declared a local disaster, opened all of the established shelters in the County, closed all the roads leading into the City of Boulder, moved our EOC to an alternate EOC at the University of Colorado (40 feet higher than ours), located emergency Incident Command Vehicles on Flagstaff Mountain, established ICS, and instituted our local and metro Mass Casualty Plans; all before the first message came from the exercise control group. The three-hour exercise lasted less than one-hour, the evaluators and representative from FERC, were blown away by our actions, and we FERCd the FERC.  Spring 2002  Colorado OEM  Page 7   Prepared  T  by Richard Bardsley Colorado OEM  he Colorado Emergency Planning Commission (CEPC) will again be hosting its Annual Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Conference. This years conference will be held at the Denver West Sheraton at 360 Union Blvd., Lakewood, Colorado September 19-20, 2002. More information will be distributed when available - but now is the time to mark you calendars. The conference is on a Thursday and Friday and if you wish to make a weekend out of it the Sheraton will offer the discounted room rates of $84 per night. According to the CEPC attendance policy, three representatives from single jurisdictional LEPCs and four representatives from LEPCs that are made up of more than one jurisdiction are allowed to attend. However, if you have more people who are interested - please submit an application. No one has ever been turned down from attending the conference. The CEPC will pay for rooms, per diem, and travel as per the State of Colorado Fiscal Rules.

If youre traveling between fifty and one hundred miles, youll be provided a room for the night of the 19th only. Less than fifty miles and youll not be provided a room by the CEPC. Although the agenda is still in draft - there are many interesting and informative subjects that will be covered, including industry presentations, computer demonstrations, open forums, and meth lab updates. Continental breakfasts and lunches will be provided both days. The Jefferson County LEPC will host a reception at the conclusion of the first day.  A  t the Annual LEPC Conference in September, the Len Boulas Hazmat Award will again be presented. Now is the time to start thinking about nominations for the award. Nomination forms will be sent to all LEPCs with the monthly CEPC minutes for the May meeting. Previous winners include Tim Gablehouse, Jo Ann Stone, and Duane Freeman. The only criteria required is the nominee must be involved in the hazmat arena in some fashion.  T  he CEPC recently held a combined outreach meeting with the Region IX LEPC and the Southern Ute Tribal LEPC in Ignacio, Colorado. The meeting was extremely successful with over forty in attendance. The CEPC would like to hold one outreach meeting per quarter outside of the Denver Metro Area. If your LEPC would like to host a meeting, please contact any CEPC member or either of the Co-Chairs, Susan Jones-Hard at (303) 692-3019 or Richard Bardsley at (303) 273-1619.  The First Paid Vacations In any given week, an average of 2.3 million Americans are off on paid vacations. They can all thank George Westinghouse, the founder of Westinghouse Electric Comapny, for launching the idea. Berginning in 1871, he instituted half days on Saturdays, which helped spur the movement toward the five-day work week. In 1913, Westinghouse was the first major employer to establish paid vacations. reminder to LEPCs  a current copy of your LEPC membership roster needs to be submitted to the CEPC for approval. Copies should be submitted at least once a year or when there is an LEPC membership change. The limited liability protection offered by state and federal statutes is based on an approved current LEPC roster.

Brochures, registration and financial aid will be available later in the year. www.wildfirecolorado.org  he Jefferson County LEPC, on behalf of and in coordination with the CEPC and with a small grant to help, has undertaken a project dealing with excess and dangerous chemicals in schools. The following is a synopsis of their efforts todate. A special advisory committee to the Colorado Board of Health gathered information and sought opinions from public health, emergency response, and school representatives regarding chemical safety in schools. Based on the input, they determined that the problems faced by schools can be broadly characterized into two groups. First, the inventories of old and hazardous chemicals in schools; and second, poor inventory control, curriculum design, and limited regulations dont prevent hazardous chemicals from entering the schools. The committee recommended, and the Board of Health adopted, new regulations in March that prohibit certain chemicals from being present in schools. Many schools end up with inventories of hazardous chemical materials. In many cases, the materials present an imminent hazard to health and safety because of degradation and/or poor storage practices. Current inventory and purchase practices continue to promote this accumulation well beyond what is appropriate to ongoing curriculum needs. Rarely is curriculum design based on the use of minimum quantities of these materials or use of hazardous materials more appropriate for the experiment being conducted. Because of the extraordinary risks to students and staff, the committee believed existing, unnecessary inventories of hazardous chemicals must be removed from schools with proper disposal. Unfortunately, the cost of such a program is beyond the reach of routine school district budgets, so the inventories accumulate. The Jefferson County LEPC sought and obtained grant funds to allow it to support a small number of school districts that are interested in addressing these problems. The grant funding will allow the LEPC to pay for the services necessary to inventory and remove old and potentially hazardous chemicals from the schools. The LEPC will also provide training to faculty, staff, and others on inventory control and curriculum design techniques to avoid these problems in the future.

A corollary to this is to be found in the cynical words of Gore Vidal who once noted, It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail. I have succeeded - others have failed. Life is good. I await the arrival of my major prize with bated breath and would not only like to thank the members of the Academy but you and Clyde as well. Now, I shall not walk but run to the 7-11 to purchase Power Ball tickets. I need to cash in on good fortune when it knocks. But dont worry - when my train comes in, everyone rides. Ill cut you in for a piece of the action. EN  h, there were so many good guesses! And we got our three winners. Because more than three submitted the correct answer to last issues Disaster Trivia Contest, we ended with a drawing to determine who the three winners would be. First, those who submitted correct answers, thank you. You were: Karen Ashcraft, Emergency Management Coordinator, Pueblo County Emergency Management; Julie Brooks, Public Information Officer with the Golden Police Department; Dave Downing, City Engineer with the City of Westminster; Charlie Hanson, District V Representative with the Montana Division of Emergency Services; Monique T. Lay, Earthquake Program Manager, State of Montana; Rick Newman, Denver Paramedic; and Eric Nilsson, Larimer County Emergency Management Specialist. The winners were Dave Downing, Rick Newman, and Erik Nilsson. Erik, feeling fortunate to have been the third and last name picked out of the hat, wanted to say this: Thank you all so much. I just dont know what to say. I never thought Id be standing up here although I have dreamed about it all my life. Id like to thank my director and fellow actors and especially the woman who has stood by, through thick and thin, throughout my entire career. I know that in any endeavor like this, one person who gets an award is just part of a larger team. So I accept this award in behalf of all who have worked so very hard to put me at this podium tonight. I also want to note the accomplishment of the fine talent who were considered for this award along with me. You have inspired me and will continue to do so. Thank you all again ..... ...and in closing, Mr. Nilsson adds...I am not so much alarmed as deflated with the news that my truck will not be required to take possession of my winnings....but I hasten to add that I am elated that I actually won something. The last time this happened was at a birthday party for my friend Eric Hansen. It was Omaha, Nebraska in the summer of 1956. I think I won a fake pocket knife. The physical manifestation of my good fortune was less important than the fact that the fates had allowed me to triumph.  O  by Clyde Anderson, Moffat County OEM Information taken from the book The Johnstown Flood, by David McCullough  I  n May of 1889, Johnstown was a town of about 30,000 people, lying in the iron-rich Conemaugh Valley near Pittsburgh. Fifteen miles upstream and 450 feet above Johnstown, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was an exclusive private resort owned by high society Pittsburgh Industrialists. An earthen dam that had long been the subject of controversy held back the water from the valley. At the time, this 450 acre body of water called Lake Conemauga was one of the largest man-made lakes in the country. Johnstown sat on a flood plain at the confluence of the Little Conemaugh River and Stony Creek. Steel mills probably kept the air full of smoke, but all around the city, lush, forested ridges rolled off in every direction. Men worked 12-hour shifts in the steel mills. If they earned $10 a week they were doing good, and many lived in cheap company houses along the riverbanks. As the Johnstown Tribune once put it, Loud and pestiferous stinks prevail. But, there were no slums, and nobody was going hungry. The climb up out of Johnstown would take your breath away, but on top of the ridges, there was another world, wide open, lush and clean. Memorial Day had been celebrated on Thursday, May 30, filling the streets with people, flags and flowers. But that evening, the rain began, slamming through the darkness in winddriven sheets which pounded against the roof tops as the residents of Johnstown turned in for the night. (Continued on page 11)  Page 10  Colorado OEM  Spring 2002   Prepared They gathered in ankle-deep mud, straining to see the destruction as the darkness began to lift. The devastation was estimated at a quarter mile wide and two miles long. Every bridge was gone except for a large stone bridge in the middle of town. Piled against it was a large, blazing heap of debris. Survivors began to rescue people from rooftops and search the wreckage for signs of life. Walls were still caving in and more fires were breaking out as gas mains exploded. Problems were enormous. People were hungry, but there was no food or drinking water. Thousands were homeless and injured. Many people were in shock and suffering from exposure. The dead and dying lay everywhere and there was a threat of disease. People built rafts and began to cross the rivers to rescue survivors. Farmers from the surrounding areas brought clothing, food and water. Unclaimed children were being cared for and a crew was working on rigging a telegraph wire to the next town. At 3:00 p.m., a meeting of all able-bodied men was called. A dictator named Arthur Moxham was elected to be in charge. He immediately organized citizens committees to address the most urgent problems. Morgues, victim identification and burial were assigned to a team of ministers. Other men were put in charge of removing dead animals and debris. A team of doctors was put in charge of establishing temporary hospitals. A man was put in charge of establishing law and order, as the entire police force had been killed. Seventy-five men were immediately deputized and began protecting two banks still standing. They were also put in charge of collecting cash found laying in the mud and debris. A committee was established for supplies and finance. Another was appointed to address sanitation issues. As dusk fell upon the valley, the search for victims continued. Hundreds of people would never be found. At the morgues, bodies piled up faster than they could be handled. We had no record books, a worker wrote, and had to use with great economy the paper which we gathered amid the debris or happened to have in our pockets. No one had any way of knowing how many people had died. There would never be an exact count, but the generally accepted death toll was set at 2,209. Ninety-nine entire families died. Three-hundred and ninety-six children under the age of ten were killed. Ninety-eight children lost both parents. One-hundred and twenty-four women lost their husbands. One-hundred and ninety-eight men lost their wives. News editors had no first-hand statistics to report and exaggerated the death toll to as high as 10,000. A reporter from New York City wrote nobody who has been here for an hour would think anything too awful to be possible. The phrase no pen can describe was used often. (Continued on page 12)  (Continued from page 10)  T  he storm had started in the plains, but when it struck Pennsylvania it was the worst downpour on record. Nobody welcomed it, as there had been too much rain that spring, and the rivers were already running high. By early Friday morning, May 31st, the rain had stopped, leaving a thick fog in the valley. There had already been signs of trouble. A landslide had caved in a stable and anyone that was awake could hear the roar of water. The rivers were rising at more that a foot per hour. Mill workers were told to go home and look after their families. There was water in most basements. Schools had been closed, and the children sent home. Many could be seen splashing about in the streets playing with makeshift toy boats. A hard rain soon resumed. Many residents moved furniture to upper floors and evacuated to higher ground. By noon, the water was higher than the flood of 1887, making this the worst flood on record. Several bridges in town had been swept away. At 1:00 p.m., a telegraph message warned that the dam was in danger of failing. The message warned the people of Johnstown to prepare for the worst. This message was not taken seriously for the residents of Johnstown had heard such warnings before. The warning was spread to few people, and even fewer took it seriously. At 3:15 p.m., someone from the Central Telephone office called the Tribune and told a reporter that the danger of the dam breaking was increasing. But, by 3:15 p.m., the water of Lake Conemaugh was already on the way to Johnstown. The whole dam seemed to push out all at once, witnesses said. Within 36 minutes, the lake was empty. The flood raced towards Johnstown like a giant wall. Chunks of the dam, logs, rocks, trees, houses, animals and debris beyond description were swept before the wall of water. Fires raged deep within the debris and smoke began to cover the valley. Most people never saw the water coming; they only heard it. Many people said that the wall of water was preceded by a strong wind that blew down small buildings and knocked people to the ground. The devastation of Johnstown took about ten minutes. By dawn the next day, survivors had gathered, chilled to the bone, hungry, many of them severely injured.

Special thanks to Clyde Anderson.  T  he sympathy generated by accounts of the disaster brought on an outpouring of charity. In Pittsburgh, a crowd gathered at the steps of city hall where industrialist Robert Pitcarin spoke. It is not tomorrow you want to act, but today. Thousands of lives were lost in a moment, and the living need immediate help. A call for contributions netted over $48,000 in less than an hour. In all, $3,742,818 in cash donations was received, which was an enormous sum of money in the late 1800s. Trains full of food and supplies were donated from across the country and thousands of workers pitched in to help rebuild. One of the most noteworthy relief workers was a woman who brought with her members of her newly formed American Red Cross. Clara Barton and her delegation of 50 doctors and nurses arrived on June 5th. Clara had helped at other disasters, but when she arrived at Johnstown, she knew that they had arrived at their first major disaster. Red Cross hospitals were set up and earned the reputation of being the cleanest, bestorganized hospitals in town. Six Red Cross hotels for the homeless were also constructed. Clara ordered a doorto-door survey, which revealed many injured people too weak to help themselves. There were many cases of shock. Red Cross hospitals operated for five months. Less than a week after the disaster, nationwide interest in the South Fork Hunting and Fishing Club began to grow. Fish guards had been placed on dam spillways to prevent fish from escaping from the lake into the river. These iron bars had clogged with debris, allowing the water in the lake to reach dangerous levels. Waste gates had been closed when the club took possession of the dam years earlier. On June 6th, a coroner s jury in Cambria County came to a decision that clearly fixed blame on the club, leaving no question that criminal negligence was involved. Although lawsuits for negligence and wrongful death were filed, no money was ever collected from the club or from any club members. It is doubtful club members personally knew the dam was unsafe, but the fact none of them were ever required to pay for their mistakes infuriated nearly everyone and left a feeling of resentment that lasted for generations. The failure of the club to remove the fish guards came to symbolize everything repulsive about the club. A man named Isaac Reed wrote this widely quoted poem:  T  he death toll from this man-made disaster is reported at over 2,000. Nine thousand were injured, many permanently, and 6,000 were left homeless. Almost a thousand sustained eye injuries. Over fifteen hundred homes were totally destroyed and 12,000 were damaged. There was a blizzard that night after the disaster and many of the homeless froze to death. A relief committee was immediately initiated to provide clothing, money, and furniture and this committee existed for almost 59 years. Thirty million dollars worth of donations were managed by the relief committee. Improvements in medical treatment, social welfare, public health and hospital facilities, and security were all a result of this devastating disaster.

The information provided below is only in brief summary form, and can easily be amplified. If you wish any information in addition, be sure to let me know. 2. Fallout Shelters. Working closely with the new County CD Director, all shelter records have been updated and most of the shelters surveyed. The status of all supplies and equipment is good and additional supplies have been ordered for Arapahoe High School. 3. Radiological Instruments. All operational kits of instruments in the City (primarily for local radiation accidents) have been replaced by new equipment. Kits are located as follows: Public Works - 2, Fire Station 3 - 2, Fire Station 2 - 2, Fire Station 1 - 2, EOC - 2, Rescue Group - 2. 4. Radiological Training. A State Department of Education Radiological Training Class is now underway for rescue and fire personnel. Its emphasis is on local emergencies that could be caused by an accident to an interstate radiological shipment or local fire involving isotopes. 5. First Aid. Police, fire and rescue personnel participated in an all day first aid training class at Fire Station 2 on 5 Oct. 68. Basic course materials were from the Emergency Care text of the American College of Surgeons. 6. Police Supplies. Continuing contact is being maintained with the State CD Agency to provide the Police Department with needed equipment that is stockpiled at Camp George West. 7. New Fire Station. We have been advised by the Colorado Civil Defense that Littleton will be eligible for matching funds for the development of an EOC and emergency communications center in the basement of the new fire station. The Director has received procedural manuals for the preparation of the necessary paper work and has advised that we want to investigate this avenue of funding. 8. The Colorado Search and Rescue Coordinating Board is presently developing a new directory of Search and Rescue units of the state and is working on plans for a uniform policy of procedures to be used by any municipality for securing help from these units. As chairman of the directory committee, your director will keep the City advised as these develop. 9. Warning Point. A recent change in the State Warning Point Plan has designated Littleton as the primary warning point for Arapahoe County. This involves the necessity of relaying all information of an emergency nature that is received at our warning point to Arapahoe County, Englewood and Aurora.  Spring 2002  Colorado OEM  Page 13   Prepared  T  by Jeff Brislawn, Former Colorado Drought Water Availability Task Force chair Colorado Office of Emergency Management Water Status summary: At the May 23 WATF meeting, the latest conditions were assessed. Following are some obsevations coming out of that meeting. Colorado is in a creeping, multi-year drought. Mountain snowpack continues to dwindle, with 19% of average (24% of last year) as of May 1. The benchmark April 1 snowpack was 52% of average statewide overall (60% of last year), and is a better measure of the winter seasons total snowfall. This is the lowest seen on that date since 1977 and the fourth consecutive below average April 1 snowpack. Two consecutive hot summers have also left the soil moisture conditions poor and have eroded surplus reservoir storage. April precipitation was below to extremely below average statewide. April temperatures were above normal, particularly in the mountains. Stream flows are tracking with the bleak runoff season forecasts and low snowpack, with all basins having below to extremely below to exceptionally below average runoff. Some streams peaked in April when in a typical year the runoff peaks in May or June. The forecast statistics indicate that this year will likely break minimum streamflow records set in 1977. This includes all river basins in Colorado. With statewide reservoir storage (May 1) at 86% of average, the reservoirs are not expected to fill this year and are anticipated to be drawn down significantly. Water users with junior water rights are being cutoff this year. Most municipal reservoirs are in good shape, but several municipalities now have mandatory or voluntary water restrictions to ensure an adequate supply if the drought wears on. Relief in sight? The only bright spot discussed at the meeting were the short and long term forecasts. The evening of the meeting, a winter storm warning was posted for the Northern Front Range foothills with one-half to one inch of rain expected for the northeastern plains. This storm delivered as promised, with 8-10"" of snow in much of the foothills. The western slope, however, received only scattered showers. The consensus at the meeting was that a lot of continuous moisture was needed to recover from this drought. For much of Colorado that means waiting to see what next winter brings in terms of snowfall. (Continued on page 15)  he weather is a popular subject of conversation in Colorado, and lately the conversations tend to gravitate towards how dry its been. Colorados Drought Water Availability Task Force (a.k.a. Drought Task Force) has confirmed what many have sensed or feared lately: the majority of Colorado is undergoing severe to extreme drought. Task Force Background As the monitoring element of Colorados Drought Mitigation and Response Plan the Water Availability Task Force (WATF) has been meeting on at least a quarterly basis since 1981. The task force has been meeting on a monthly basis in 2002 to monitor what has become one of the driest winters and springs since 1977. The WATF has been chaired since its inception by a representative from the Colorado Office of Emergency Management (COEM). At the April 24 meeting the torch was passed from COEMs Jeff Brislawn, the chair for the previous three years, to Brad Lundahl at the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB). Brad is the head of the CWCB Office of Water Conservation and a logical choice for the chairmanship as someone who deals with water issues on a daily basis. Drought Plan Activation On April 23 Governor Owens requested a statewide USDA drought declaration and directed the Water Availability Task Force to activate the Colorado Drought Mitigation and Response Plan in response to the growing concerns across the state. Several Impact Task Forces mobilized as a result to assess current and potential drought impacts on Colorados economy and environment. Initial action recommendations were developed for the Governor with an emphasis on actions that could be addressed by the legislature. On the day of the May 23 WATF meeting, the Governor signed two bills related to drought: HB02-1414 and HB02-1152. HB02-1414 authorizes the State Engineer to review and approve substitute water supply plans that would provide alternative water supplies for drought-impacted communities. HB02-1152 authorizes the use of the Colorado Water Conservation Boards construction fund to repair water facilities that allow for more water storage.

Some good news on the horizon is a strengthening El Nino in the Pacific Ocean. Though not anticipated to be as strong as the previous El Nino, it could affect our monsoon weather patterns by August according to Klaus Wolter of the NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center. His July-September outlook shows a chance to be slightly wetter than average for the Eastern Slope, but no strong indicationswet or dryfor the Western Slope. El Nino years typically benefit most of the state with excess winter, and some fall precipitation with the exception of the northwest corner of the state. Drought preparedness The unusually widespread and severe drought Colorado now faces emphasizes the importance of drought preparedness and mitigation. A frightening prospect would be another winter as dry or drier on top of the one we just had. A study by the Colorado Climate Center indicates that severe, multi-year droughts have affected Colorado in the past. In addition to the activation of the state drought plan, the CWCB is undertaking a survey of the states water suppliers water storage to identify how the CWCB can support water suppliers in planning for and mitigating drought impacts. This survey will try to assess how prepared Colorado is for a sustained multiyear drought. No one can say how long the current drought will last, but in the meantime the Water Availability Task Force and other Impact Task Forces will continue meeting monthly to closely monitor the situation and recommend any necessary action to reduce drought impacts.

Date: Page 1 of 2 GA-005 1-1-2003  Purpose: To establish a policy governing the use of electronic mail within DOA.  Policy Statement: 1. Electronic mail messages, including attachments, should be used as much as possible to conserve resources, to reduce operating costs and to minimize unnecessary meetings. 2. Electronic mail messages are covered within the definition of ""public records"" in G.S. 132-1. Where appropriate, E-mail may be exempt from disclosure as a confidential document - for example, certain communications by legal counsel, personnel records, and other legal exceptions to public record disclosure. 3. All E-mail is the property of the Department. Employees should not have any expectations of privacy in the use of E-mail, except as previously noted with regard to established exceptions to public records disclosure. 4. E-mail is intended for use for official State business and matters within the scope of employment, broadly defined. 5. Minimal and necessary personal or quasi-business communications via the E-mail systems are acceptable, particularly where convenience (and ultimate savings of State employee time and State resources) dictates their use; but in no event may their use interfere with normal business activities. Illustrative examples of acceptable ""minimal and necessary"" usage, of a personal or quasi-business nature, are: a. Notices of social and public service events, such as ""Habitat for Humanity"", blood drives, etc. b. Work group gatherings in or out of the office (group lunches, ball games, birthdays, etc.) c. Divisional or inter-agency notification used for communicating good will among users (holiday greetings, congratulatory messages, etc.) d. Messages home re: office hours, travel, etc. e. Messages (for convenience) to other LAN, WAN or Internet users concerning individual plans and activities. These would include communications similar to current telephone usage. 7. E-mail usage, consistent with this memorandum, should in no event involve messages which are illegal or against public policy. Illustrative examples of unacceptable usage are:   Electronic Mail GA-POL-007 Page 2 of 2  a. Discriminatory information (race, creed, color, gender, religion, physical disability or sexual preference). b. Sexual harassment or sexual misconduct. c. Transmittal of pornographic or profane material. d. Personal business use or commercial activities. e. Personal political beliefs or political campaign activities. f. Wagering, betting. GUIDELINES 1. Assume your E-mail messages are being read by people other than the addressee. There is no reasonable expectation of privacy for e-mail messages. 2. Remember that the messages are permanent and that transcripts can be taken out of context after you've forgotten the message. 3. Take care in phrasing messages. Don't use e-mail to express strong emotions and be careful about humorous expressions, because they look different in print. Remember that E-mail is not private. Non-verbal portions of a message (i.e., humor) may not be picked up by the receiver, and may not be understood by unintended readers, so if you are joking it is best to say so. 4. Change your password often, never give it out, and consider handling confidential communications outside e-mail if at all possible. 5. Be careful that you do not send mail to the wrong person when you select a name from address lists. Be very careful with distribution lists. 6. Document retention for e-mail is governed by Department of Culture Resources policies and is essentially the same as for any other type of document. Employees should be familiar with and should follow their document retention schedule.

Date: Page 1 of 2 GA-009 1-1-2003  Purpose: To establish a policy regarding the display of the Flag of the State of North Carolina which conforms with the rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the Flag of the United States of America.  Policy Statement: It is the custom to display the Flag of the State of North Carolina only from sunrise to sunset on State buildings and stationary flagstaffs in front of State buildings. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the Flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness. The State Flag should not be displayed in inclement weather, unless an all-weather flag is used. The State Flag, when carried in a procession with the United States Flag, should be on the marching left; that is, to the left of the United States Flag. The State Flag should never be placed above the United States Flag; if on the same level, to the right of the United States Flag. When the State Flag is displayed with the United States Flag against a wall from crossed staffs, it should be on the left, the Flag's own left, and its staff should be behind the staff of the United States Flag. When the State Flag is flown on the same halyard with the United States Flag, it should always be under the United States Flag. When the State Flag is flown from adjacent staffs, the United States Flag should always be hoisted first and lowered last. Upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government, if the President of the United States orders the United States Flag flown at half-staff, the same will apply to the North Carolina State Flag as a mark of respect to their memory. The period of time that the United States Flag shall be displayed at half-staff shall be determined by the Presidential order, or in the absence of any order or instruction, as defined in Title 36, United States Code, Chapter 10, Section 175. The Flag of the State of North Carolina shall be displayed at half-staff for the same period of time as the Flag of the United States It is the policy of the State of North Carolina that the flags shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of current and former public officials as follows:   Display of State Flag GA-009 Page 2 of 2      Upon the Death of the Governor: on the day of death until interment (United States and North Carolina flags) Upon the Death of the Lieutenant Governor or the Speaker of the North Carolina House: on the day of death (both flags), until interment (the North Carolina flag) Upon the Death of the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, a Public Official currently heading a State Department, or a Member of the General Assembly: on the day of death (the United States and North Carolina flags) Upon the Death of a Former Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or Speaker of the House: on the day of death (only the North Carolina flag) Upon the Death of a Former Justice or Former Head of a State Department: the Chief Justice or current head of the department may prescribe that the flag in front of that agency's building(s) only shall be flown at half-staff on the day of death (only the North Carolina flag) Upon the Death of a Former Member of the General Assembly: the leadership of the General Assembly may prescribe that the flag in front of the legislative buildings shall be flown at half-staff on the day of death (only the North Carolina flag)       At no time shall an order be given that would result in the Flag of the State of North Carolina being displayed in a manner inconsistent with the various policies governing the display of both the United States and North Carolina Flags. As an example, since no flag may ever be flown above the Flag of the United States, it shall never be possible for the Flag of North Carolina to be displayed at full-staff while the United States Flag is at half-staff. The above North Carolina State Flag policy applies at all times unless otherwise ordered by the President of the United States or the Governor of North Carolina.

Date: Page 1 of 1 GA-015 1-1-2003  Purpose: To inform DOA employees of their attendance expectations during adverse weather conditions.  Policy Statement: The geographical location and diversity of State services and programs make it impossible to apply a uniform statewide policy regarding how operations will be affected in time of adverse weather conditions. The administrative offices of State Government in Wake County must be open during normal business hours to serve local governments and the citizens of North Carolina and to provide support services to business and industry. These offices will remain open, even in adverse weather, and it is the responsibility of employees to make a good faith effort to come to work during these times. It is recognized that some other operations in and out of Wake County must continue to provide services without regard to weather conditions. Therefore, agency heads shall predetermine and designate the mandatory operations, which will remain open. Agency heads, or their designated representatives, may determine to what extent any other operations may be suspended or temporarily closed. Employees should monitor local news reports and contact their supervisors about any questions in reference to reporting to work during adverse weather.

Date: Page 1 of 2 GA-016 1-1-2003  Purpose: This plan provides the basic instruction for employees in the event a Tornado ""Watch"" or ""Warning"" is issued by the National Weather Service for the Raleigh area. General Information Tornadoes in this geographical area are normally spawned from severe thunderstorms. Usually hail will precede the thunderstorm Tornadoes are formed rapidly, move quickly and follow an erratic path, allowing for little on no advance warning. A TORNADO WATCH simply means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to develop. Tornadoes are most likely to happen in the late afternoon on hot spring days. However tornadoes have occurred in every month at all times of the day or night. Tornadoes often - but not always occur in conjunction with a severe thunderstorm producing hail. When a tornado watch is in effect, one should be alert for agency notifications and local weather reports. A TORNADO WARNING means a tornado has actually been sighted. If a tornado warning is issued for your area, you should seek shelter immediately. Be aware of emergency shelter plans in your office building or work location. If a specific shelter area does not exist, move into an interior hallway or small room on the building's lowest level. Avoid areas with glass and wide, freespan roofs.  Action: The State Capitol Police will activate the emergency paging system to notify the Secretary's Office for DOA, DOA Safety Director, DOA division's representatives, floor monitors and other state agencies occupying offices in the Administration Building for all Tornado Watch and Warning Bulletins received for the Raleigh area. A. Capitol Police will provide tornado spotters whenever a ""Watch"" or ""Warning"" bulletin is announced for the Raleigh area. B. When the weather monitor issues a ""Tornado Watch"" bulletin for the Raleigh area the State Capitol Police shall page the following message ""Attention: A Tornado 'watch' has been issued for the Raleigh area from ____________(time) until ___________(time). Please remain alert for further notices."" Routine transportation of DOA vehicles should be suspended while the ""watch"" is in effect. Employees, such as landscape personnel, who are working outside should remain alert and seek shelter if a ""warning"" is announced. C. When the weather monitor issues a ""Tornado Warning"" bulletin for the Raleigh area the State Capitol Police shall page the following message ""Attention: A Tornado 'Warning' has been issued for the Raleigh area from ________(time) until _______(time). Please implement the tornado-warning plan and move to your designated tornado shelter areas.""   Tornadoes GA-016 Page 2 of 2  The tornado ""warning"" requires employees to go to designated tornado shelter areas or seek appropriate shelter as follows: 1. The basement or an interior hallway on a lower floor is safest. Upper stories are less safe. If there is no option to descend to a lower level, a closet or small room with stout walls or an inside hallway will give protection against flying debris. Otherwise, protection under heavy furniture is advised. Do not use elevators when a ""Warning"" bulletin is announced due to of probable mechanical failure. Note: Employees on the 5th and 4th floors of the Administration Building should move to designated areas on the 3rd and 2nd floor respectively. 2. If outside, seek shelter indoors if possible. Move away from a tornado's path at a right angle. If there is no time to escape, lie flat in the nearest depression, such as a ditch or ravine. Cars are unsafe as shelter. D. At the end of the ""Watch"" or ""Warning"" period, the State Capitol Police shall page out the following announcement. ""Attention: The tornado/warning has ended."" Please resume normal activities.

The procedures contained herein describe how a rapid and orderly evacuation will be initiated and carried out.  Policy Statement: Introduction It may be necessary to evacuate the Department of Administration Building during an emergency. Some causes for evacuation could be fire, explosion, bomb threat, flood, toxic fumes, electrical failure, or structural failure. Evacuation shall proceed as rapidly and safely as possible during an emergency. The Secretary of DOA, in approving the plan, urges each employee to become familiar with the procedures for her/his own safety and protection. The Department of Administration Building should not be evacuated during a severe storm, hurricane, or tornado. Other emergency procedures shall be followed for these events. Organization The Department of Administration building will have one emergency evacuation coordinator and two alternate coordinators to ensure one person is physically in the building at all times. Each floor will have three floor monitors who will certify that all areas are evacuated. Each Division will have a division representative who maintains a pager for emergency messages from the State Capitol Police. In addition, the Safety Director and one monitor on each floor of the Administration Building will maintain a pager for the same reason. Knowledge of the Building All employees shall become familiar with the physical characteristics of the building to guarantee that evacuations are efficient and orderly. The attached plans for each floor of the Department of Administration Building designate the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

The alarm is activated by the building's automatic smoke detection system. The alarm   Emergency Evacuation Plan GA-018 Page 2 of 5  may also be activated manually by using the wall-mounted pull activation units. Upon hearing the emergency evacuation alarm, all employees and visitors shall take immediate action to evacuate automatically. The Coordinator will then activate the alarm system, notify the adjacent building and notify the proper authorities. The State Capitol Police will activate the emergency paging system when appropriate to give special instructions to evacuation Coordinators, Division Representatives and Floor Monitors during emergency evacuations and other emergency situations such as tornadoes, hurricanes, bomb threats and chemical spills. Emergency Evacuation Procedures Authority Any employee shall pull the alarm activation device during an emergency and report immediately to the ground floor lobby fire alarm control panel or to an area outside the rear doors if the lobby is unsafe.

Floor monitors will maintain a list of all employees with disabilities in his/her work area and submit a copy of that list to the ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"". The ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" will notify all alternate Coordinators of the Persons with Mobility Impairments List from each floor. Employees are reminded that it is their responsibility to assure that their name is on the list when they feel there is a need for them to receive special assistance. It should also be understood that the disability need not be permanent, but could be temporary, such a broken leg, broken ankle or foot, visual impairment, late term pregnancy, severe sprains, or other physical conditions that might impair safe movement by means of stairs. During an evacuation, all employees with disabilities shall proceed immediately to the nearest stairway exit and wait for the stairway to clear before entering the stairway corridor. Upon stairway clearance from the floors above, all employees with disabilities will stage themselves on the platform inside the stairway corridor and await emergency rescue personnel. The floor monitor may evacuate the disabled employee by means of the Evacutrack. After clearance of their respective floor, one of the floor monitors shall immediately notify the building ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" of the location of employees with disabilities. Another floor monitor shall remain with the employees until fire and police personnel evacuate them. Evacuation Collection Points Upon evacuation, employees shall proceed to the collection areas, which are: the Northeast section of the rear parking lot to the Department of Administration Building and across Lane Street (see   Emergency Evacuation Plan GA-018 Page 3 of 5  Evacuation Diagram at the end of this policy.)

Department of Administration Building shall have one ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" and four alternates. He/she shall establish an evacuation control point at the alarm control panel on the ground floor to coordinate evacuation activities. Employee Function Employees shall evacuate the building calmly and quietly upon alarm or at floor monitors' direction. Employees failing to abide by direction to evacuate the building shall be reported to their immediate supervisor and will be subject to disciplinary action. The primary concern of all employees shall be to evacuate the building as rapidly and orderly as possible. Employees need not be concerned with closing windows or doors, but if doors are closed for security purposes, the supervisor of that section shall ensure that the locked area is accessible to fire and police personnel. Employees shall allow clear passage for the ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" and floor monitors. Bomb Threat Procedure (Reference: GA-019, Bomb Threat, DOA Policy and Procedure Manual) The safety of personnel is the utmost consideration during an emergency. All bomb threats will be treated seriously and prompt action shall be taken to ensure safety. When an employee receives a bomb threat call, he/she shall immediately call the Capitol Police at 733-4646 and report all information pertinent and available. Capitol Police will then decide whether the building will or will not be evacuated. If the building is to be evacuated the State Capitol Police will activate the Emergency paging system for the floor monitors and Safety Director who will see that their floor is evacuated normally by pulling the fire alarm and then go directly to the ground floor to give all pertinent information to the ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"". If the Capitol Police decide NOT to evacuate the building, then the employee will immediately advise the ""Emergency Evacuation   Emergency Evacuation Plan GA-018 Page 4 of 5  Coordinator"" with all available information. All employees shall use the emergency evacuation procedures provided by the floor monitor. Severe Weather Procedures Extra precaution is needed during a storm, high winds, hurricane, or tornado to assure the safety of employees while in the Department of Administration Building. Not only is there a large concentration of people in a small area, but this building has a large area of glass on the outside walls. In the event of a storm, hurricane, or tornado, the State Capitol Police shall contact the floor monitors who will make notifications using the P.A. system or messenger, Employees are required to: 1. Go to the innermost portions of their floors. 2. Avoid windows and glass doorways. 3. Not use elevators. Power failure could trap elevator occupants. 4. Protect their heads and crouch behind solid or secure barriers, making as small a target for flying debris and glass as possible. 5. Persons with disabilities will move to the designated area in the innermost portion of the floor they are occupying and will be accompanied by a floor monitor until the all clear is given. Employee Training and Annual Drills All building employees shall be trained in emergency evacuation procedures. A copy of the Emergency Evacuation Plan will be readily accessible to all employees on all floors. Each employee's supervisor is responsible for annually reviewing the Emergency Evacuation Plan and related procedures with all their employees. All new employees will receive from their immediate supervisor a review of the Emergency Evacuation Plan and procedures on their first day of employment. Evacuation procedures shall also include, but not be limited to, identification of exits and collection areas, location and use of alarms, fire extinguishers and fire hoses, and location of floor monitor signs. The building's ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" shall be responsible for coordinating his/her efforts with local emergency service personnel in order that semi-annual (minimum) evacuation drills are held in accordance with established policies, procedures, and regulations. The ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" shall meet with floor monitors at least quarterly to review emergency plans and procedures and potential new building emergency and evacuation needs. The ""Coordinator"" shall provide training to the monitors as required. The ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" is responsible for the overall evacuation of personnel from the Department of Administration Building. The ""Coordinator"" is also responsible for a written evaluation of each evacuation. This evaluation shall be filed and shall be open to review and amendment. A plan of corrective action will be required to correct noted areas of deficiency that may have been observed during evacuation drills or actual emergency evacuations. After deficiencies have been corrected, the ""Emergency Evacuation Coordinator"" may conduct follow up drills to assess efforts to remedy noted deficiencies. See evacuation diagram on next page.

Date: Page 1 of 3 GA-021 1-1-2003  Purpose: To establish a policy ensuring citizens the right of access to public records.  Policy Statement: It is the policy of the North Carolina Department of Administration to comply in full with the provisions of G.S. 132 guaranteeing citizens the right of access to public records. Notify the Public Information Officer about any request for public records, especially a request from the media, before releasing the information. If the information is of a sensitive or legal nature, the General Counsel should be consulted. Public records in the Department are available for supervised inspection during normal business hours. Copies of any public records will be provided free of charge or for a fee which reflects the actual cost of making the copy. In the case of a request for copies that requires extensive use of information technology resources or an extensive use of clerical or supervisory assistance, the agency may charge a reasonable service charge in accordance with GS 132-6.2(b). Copies will be supplied within 24 hours of the request unless the volume to be copied is such that, in the judgment of the agency head, such a schedule would substantially interfere with the agency's work. If the agency head makes such a determination, she/he will specify a delivery date.  Background DOA has a continuing commitment to follow the provisions of the state's laws on access to public records. That commitment includes establishment of a Department policy on fees and payment provisions used in recovery of the direct costs associated with providing copies of public records. State statutes do not specify what charges are to be made for copying public records -- only that they be ""reasonable"" and recover ""actual costs"" of copying. DOA, accordingly, will establish its policy for copying charges based on expenses that are directly involved in providing public records.  Charges The Table below details price per page, based on volume. These charges are the same, whether the Division possessing the public record does the copying or requires the requester to make the copies sought. The price assumes the requestor uses the department's copying equipment. A page in these guidelines refers to ""a single impression."" For example, if a double-sided original is copied, two (2) impressions would have been made and the charge would be for 2 pages.   Access to Public Records GA-021 Page 2 of 3  Table 1: Photocopy Expenses VOLUME Less than or equal to 20 pages Greater than 20 pages  PRICE PER PAGE Free $0.10 per page  A. General Policy on Charges 1. All public records should remain in the control and possession of the custodian of those records. 2. Where data has been gathered and provided according to Federal mandates, Federal policy guidelines on copy charges override Department policy. 3. On requests for ""special case"" copies (oversized maps, high-resolution copies, color copies), the Division/Section/Office providing the copies may charge a fee consistent with the direct costs of the copying. That cost shall be determined by the Division that possesses the public record. B. Electronic Data The direct costs associated with providing electronic depending on the media (method) used to prepare and required by the data analyst to extract and/or format the made for processor time and storage for data on the SIPS copies of public records will vary distribute the data and on the time data. In addition, a charge may be mainframe.

Rates are subject to change as rates change at SIPS. C. Postage and Shipping Postage and shipping charges will be the direct costs charged by the U.S. Postal Mail Service and courier services; shipping to include materials used for mailing. D. Payments 1. Prepayment may be required of requestors seeking copies of public records. 2. Each Division/Section/Office responding to requests for public records will take care of its own collections and maintain its own billing records in accordance with the State and Department Cash Management Plan. 3. When photocopies or electronic copies of public records are made by the custodian on-site with the requestor present, payment is to be made immediately upon the completion of the copying. 4. A custodian may require prior payment for data distributed off-site (by mail or otherwise shipped.) 5. If a requestor is more than 30 days past due on payment, then the custodian may deny further requests by the same requestor for information until the balance is   Access to Public Records GA-021 Page 3 of 3  paid. The custodian may refer any debts incurred for copying public records that remain uncollectible through Fiscal Management to the Attorney General's Office for collection. 6. Payment may be made (at the discretion of the Division) by check, certified check, money order, or cash. A receipt will be provided upon request for all cash payments or by certified check, check, or money order. 7. Checks and money orders for payment of copies of public records must be made payable to: ""DOA Division or Section Name"" (e.g. DOA/Purchase and Contract). 8. Receipts for funds paid for copies of public records should be deposited at least once each week; receipts in excess of $250 must be deposited within 24 hours of collection. E. Accounting and Budgeting 1. Revenue generated by the sale of copies of public records must be used only to directly offset the allowable expenses of preparing and distributing public records. 2. Receipts collected by any Division/Section/Office will be placed in the appropriate account and center codes. Below are recommended revenue accounts and associated types of receipts. 434132001 434134 434310 43490 Data Processing Services Printing, Binding, and Duplication Services Sale of Publications Other Sale of Goods CPU, Storage, Analyst Charges Photocopies Pre-printed maps, documents Printout, media  3.

(photo) A Show of Honor:  Seattle Firefighters salute their fallen colleagues during the Memorial dedication.      There was an emotional silence as the cover draping the four bronze statues of firefighters was slowly raised.        (photo) The Fallen Remembered:  Participants in the dedication of the Fallen Firefighters' Memorial surround the bronze statues and slabs of granite that honor the 34 Seattle firefighters who have died in the line of duty.      ""Today, we stand before a monument to heroism, bravery and compassion,"" said Fire Chief James Sewell, during the dedication ceremony. ""We stand before a tribute to men and women who thought it was more important to serve others, than themselves, who believed in risking their lives so that others could live.""        (photo) Show of Support:  The Vancouver, BC Police Bagpipe Band helped honor Seattle's fallen firefighters.      Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, Luther Fincher of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, Local 27 President Paul Harvey and other dignitaries were present. Chief Wesley Goss, who has worked on the project for more than three years, hosted the program. Lt. Bill Elleby, who tirelessly worked for months planning the memorial dedication, rang the bell as Chief Sewell read the names of the 34 firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty. The names of the fallen firefighters are etched in the slabs of granite that make up part of the memorial.      Dedication of the $225,000 memorial was the high- light of this year's Fire Festival, which included entertainment, crafts, food and a parade of fire apparatus.        NEW EMS TEXTBOOKS      By Training Division Staff      The Fire Department recently distributed new EMS textbooks to all companies and divisions.  Prehospital Emergency Care , Fifth Edition, published by Brady was suggested by King County EMS. The book was reviewed and approved by the Fire Department and Dr. Copass. In addition to containing updated information,  Prehospital Emergency Care  meets the standards for the U.S. Department of Transportation's Basic EMT curriculum.     The May-June Bi-Monthly EMS Test will be postponed to give members an opportunity to get acquainted with the new EMS book. The old  Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured  (the orange book) will remain in the library for a short time. This will allow members to compare information between the old and new books.      If you have any questions about the new book, please call Lieutenant Thaddeus Z. Mercer at 6-1774. Lt. Mercer is available Tuesday through Friday during normal business hours.         SAFETY OFFICER CERTIFICATION      By Leslie Jackson (with assistance from Chief David Daniels)      The Health and Safety Office has been busy during the past two months. In addition to the Pre-Incident Survey Program, the Health and Safety Officers are hard at work on several other projects, including Health and Safety Officer Certification.     Chief David Daniels has set up a Health and Safety Officer Certification project team, which includes representatives from Local 27 and Labor and Industries. The team's ultimate goal is to make the Seattle Fire Department the first in the nation with certified Health and Safety Officers.      This process includes the following:         Reviewing NFPA 1521 Standard for Fire Department Safety     Officer, to assure that the Department meets the highest possible state and national     standards       Reviewing and modifying the existing Safety Officer     Operating Instructions       Establishing curriculum to meet these standards and     developing written policies to support the qualification process        When this team is finished, our Health and Safety Officers will have city, state and national certification, as well as International Fire Service Accreditation Congress approval.     This is just another step that the Health and Safety Office is taking to emphasize further education and awareness of safety issues, which ultimately benefits the entire Department.              LEARN NOT TO BURN      By Lisa Van Horn      The summer season brings with it a rise in child-set fires. Children are out of the structured school environment and spend more time in unsupervised activities.     FireStoppers, the Department's Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Program, is busy during the summer months helping children who have used fire inappropriately. Referrals to the program come from parents, fire incident reports, police reports, social service agencies, schools and the juvenile court. Last year, the program assisted over 30 families to put an end to their children's fire-setting behavior.      In an effort to raise awareness among parents about the importance of keeping fire-starting materials out of the reach of children, the Department is participating in a regional campaign entitled ""Kids Can Have a Burning Curiosity."" Using materials developed under a grant from St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma, the campaign includes television Public Service Announcements which will run through the months of July and August on local and national affiliates. A media event is set to kick-off the campaign on June 30, at Fireman's Park in Tacoma. Parents of high-risk children are also being targeted through Seattle preschools, day care centers and Head Start programs with a combined approach of awareness activities and prevention materials. Funding is being sought for an accompanying bus sign campaign to run in the fall.      Any questions or referrals about children and fire should be directed to the Public Education Section of the Fire Marshal's Office. Lisa Van Horn, Fire-Stoppers Program Administrator, can be reached at 386-1335.         HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION: SERVICE AWARDS      By Ginger James     The Human Resources staff has been working hard to do a better job of recognizing the dedication and commitment of employees by making timely presentations of service awards.     About two years ago, several things came together that made it possible to dramatically reduce the time involved in recognizing employees for their years of service. The HR Division was given control over ordering and stocking the actual service awards, eliminating the lengthy process of ordering through City Personnel. In addition, the Department's improved access to database software made it possible for the HR Division to use new procedures and to contact members directly     regarding their service awards preference, rather than going through the Battalions.     (photo) A Valuable Resource:  Tricia Connolley and Colleen Lafferty are responsible for making sure SFD members are recognized for their years of dedicated service.      Colleen Lafferty noted that the pins came from the City rather than the Department. If anything, it was more important to us as a Department to do something to recognize our own employees. To address this problem, Colleen designed a beautiful certificate and certificate holder from the Department.     Tricia Connolley, a Temporary Employee in the Human Resources Division, has done an excellent job of maintaining the new program.     Here is how the process works right now: About a month before a five year anniversary, you will receive a memo from Human Resources asking you about your choice of award. In the month in which your anniversary occurs, we prepare a certificate and give both items - the pin and the certificate to the appropriate Chief Officer for his or her delivery to you. (If you fail to send us back the memo indicating your preference, we pick an award for you). If the award is for 25 or 30 years of service, Chief Sewell presents the award. Assistant Chiefs recognize employees for 15 or 20 years of service, and Battalion Chiefs make the presentation for 5 or 10 years of service. Remember, service breaks impact the calculation of years of service.     At this point, the system is working well, except that it is often hard for the Chief Officers to present the awards. Particularly in Operations, it is difficult to schedule the delivery of the awards due to disabilities, vacations, etc. This is complicated by emergency responses during the lunch hour (the time we try to schedule the presentations). We are working to make continuous improvement in the system because PEOPLE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE. Recognition and appreciation are basic to putting this value into action. One final note, if you have been waiting for a service award for longer than two months, you should check with your Chief Officer to see if the award is enroute to you. If it is not, please contact us in Human Resources so that we can arrange sending the award to you.          What I would like to ask is why the Department has two different scenarios for transfers? I read the letter in the last newsletter from Chief Ramsey and I would like to know why it is different for specialty units than it is for other units. Chief Brown told me that it should be the person with the letter in first, then the seniority in that position.     I put in a letter for 10's and got denied and I think it is bad precedence that you are going to promote somebody into a position instead of allowing the Depart-ment to put in for that spot. I was one of only two people who put in for that position and I just don't think it is a fair practice or good for morale when you ask for transfer letters and then deny people before the process is even started.     Thanks and hopefully, you will answer my question.     Response from - Steven Brown, Assistant Chief, Administration      The Department and Local 27 are presently working with an ""Employee Involvement Committee"" in regard to transfers. The process is focusing on developing criteria for two different types of transfers: Specialty Teams and Regular Assignments. This issue is being reviewed because of the very problems that you have identified. When the committee finishes its recommendations, these issues should be resolved.      The specific answer to your question is that the committee, Local 27 and the Department will agree upon a transfer policy that will make transfers as objective as possible. This may or may not have different scenarios for different types of transfers. The policy on transfers should be finalized within the next few months. If you were given conflicting information, I apologize and hope that this issue will be resolved shortly.                Remember to plug in a shore power line when you leave a rig     in the Fire Garage. (There have been several dead batteries lately).       It's that time of year to check your rigs' air conditioning     systems. Checking now is better than waiting for repairs in the dog days of August             news from THE FRONT LINES...      BATTALION 2      By Chief Michael Johnson      Battalion 2, Platoon B, has been planning a series of multiple company drills. Captain James Hargett, L4/B, is planning a drill at the old Naval Reserve Building on the south shore of Lake Union. Lt. Joel Andrus, L10/B, is setting up a drill at the old Craftsman Press Building off Fairview Avenue North.      The emphasis of the drills will be to train less experienced Acting Battalion Chiefs on the basics of Incident Command, crew rotation, running a staging area and performing the duties of a Division Supervisor. Hopefully, other Platoon Chiefs will put emphasis in this area as a great deal of experienced Chief Officers are eligible to retire. Senior Operations Chiefs need to share their experience and know-how with the Incident Commanders of the future. What better way is there to do this than by allowing the Captains and Junior Battalion Chiefs the opportunity to manage realistic training exercises.      BATTALION 3      By Scott Andersen      Chief Pritchard has just returned from Las Vegas, attending the first annual International Association of Fire Chiefs EMS sectional meetings.     Issues relating to Fire Base EMS and managed care highlighted the event.      Physio Control has donated two Lifepac 500 Automatic External Defibrillators to the Medic Two program. Our Medic Two instructors are familiar with public access defibrillator training and are available to teach the general public with the new chain of survival line which is early defibrillation.      Medic One is about to initiate a Bike Medic Program. An evaluation of other bike medic programs throughout the country has shown that there is a place for such a program in Seattle. Quicker access to potential victims of medical emergencies at outdoor events and good public relations will, without a doubt, benefit the Fire Department.     BATTALION 4      By Captain Randy Hansen      Pier 91 Update: As many of you are aware, Pier 91 has been undergoing substantial demolition and renovation, the latest of which is the removal of rotting timber decking and pilings along the west wall (closest to the new marina). The majority of the bad decking has been removed and exposed pilings will be removed beginning June 15th after the fish closure. For those with pre-fires on this structure, this pertains to Berths K, L, & M.      Should we have a fire at this portion of the pier, utmost caution should be observed as there are still condemned portions of the pier to the South (sprinkler area #23) where the decking is still in place, but very structurally unsound. Under no circumstances should anyone be allowed inside the condemned areas. Smoke conditions and prevailing winds may make easy recognition of these areas difficult so ""watch out.""      BATTALION 5      By Chief Richard Schultz      Battalion 5 Companies in several platoons have been working on developing procedures for establishing decontamination corridors at emergency incidents, as well as outside of hospital emergency rooms.     They were challenged initially to construct decontamination corridors using only the equipment currently carried on the standard apparatus in-ventories. Additionally, they were encouraged to recommend any additional equipment which would enhance our ability to do this more efficiently. One suggestion, the addition of 50 rafter hangers and some smaller tie ropes, has met with a very positive response. We are continuing to evolve the ideas into a standard method for not only decontamination corridors, but also a number of other uses.     Lt. Greg Bennett, E28/B, and some other department members have forwarded a suggestion to create another SFD yearbook. In addition, they are willing to form a committee to get the project started. Call Greg with ideas or to volunteer your services to help with this worthwhile project.      BATTALION 6      By Chief Kenneth Tipler      Community Involvement: Battalion 6 is the home of much community involvement. Recently, B6 and members of Station 17 visited the Fremont Neighborhood Association monthly meeting. During the meeting, Mayor Paul Schell acknowledged the fire department's participation and invited citizens to visit their local fire stations as he, himself, has. E39 and FIU investigator Tony Little attended the Lake City Neighborhood Block Watch Association. Both organizations expressed their satisfaction with the SFD and overall delivery of city services.      Family Day: Sundays have evolved into family day at Station 17. Each Sunday, the families of the on-duty shift are invited to have dinner at the station and each Sunday, the groups seem to grow larger. It appears that the neighborly attitude of the community has spilled over into the Fire Stations.      Training: As the equipment and methodologies for our first line units change, it is becoming increasingly important to emphasize cross training. It is not unusual to find B6 Truck Companies giving Engine Companies refresher training on such equipment as the Amkus rescue tool, air bags or operating the PPV fans. Engine Companies are in turn giving refresher training to truckies on Forward and Reverse lays and coupling drills. This is typical of the cohesiveness of the Firefightin' Sixth.     BATTALION 7      By Chief Robert Davis and Chief Brian Lord     Battalion 7 and particularly E36 just completed another successful year with our P.I.P.E. partner, Gatewood Elementary School. We transported 182 students and 13 adults to tour the Fire Boats, Station 5 and the Fire Alarm Center. These were students who excelled academically and earned these trips as rewards.        Holy Rosary Rededication: Chief Brian Lord, B7/D, and Rex Guichard, E29/A, represented the Seattle Fire Department at the re-dedication ceremonies of Holy Rosary Church in West Seattle on May 31. Holy Rosary suffered a long smoldering fire in the attic area of the church one Sunday evening last summer. All of the Chief officers at the scene that evening felt that the firefighters responding on this alarm did a yeoman's job. Chief Lord wanted to relay to those members of A platoon and any others working at the fire that day the gratitude of the members of Holy Rosary Church.         (photo) School Partner:  Mike Roberts, E21/B, chows down with students at Greenwood Elementary School. The E21/B crew recently visited the children as part of our partnering program with local schools.         Anniversaries      Congratulations to the following SFD personnel who celebrate anniversaries in June:      33 Years      CP William Nelson      30 Years      LT Clarence Williams      28 Years      FF Randall Foy      27 Years      LT George Barnes      FF Paul Harvey      FF Elmer Seeman, Jr.         Recent Runs                   WE LIKE TO RECEIVE      The following are excerpts of recent letters to the Seattle Fire Department:      ""We would like to thank Captain Raul Angulo, Chris Quinlen and Mike Bastrom for preventing the raging fire next door from doing any serious damage to our house... After the fire had been put out, Raul and his crew were very concerned about the neighbors and checked up on us a number of times. We would like to say thank you for saving our house and showing concern for the neighborhood..."" --Craig and Betty Leonard      ""I am writing to let you know about the terrific firefighters we met at Station 5 on a tour... Our group provides support for families of children struggling with childhood cancer. Due to the health concerns facing our kids, I couldn't give your people a head count until a few days before the event... Your crews handled it in stride and gave each one of our little ones the personal attention they deserve... Please extend to them our gratitude for making this event a wonderful experience for our kids...      --Kathleen A. Barry, Seattle Candlelighters CCF      ""...We know the Seattle Fire Department brought their world class expertise to bear on the situation. At this point, Craig will pull through but we lost Teresa early this morning. You did everything in your power at the scene and succeeded in bringing her back for two precious days. Teresa's family all live in the Midwest and it meant a great deal to come to Seattle to say goodbye before she passed on. Thank you for your professionalism and dedication to a tough job. We are so grateful.      --The Family and Friends of Teresa and Craig      ""I wish to express my appreciation and admiration for the firefighters and paramedics at Station 10 who recently hosted me for dinner and allowed me to accompany them on an emergency call... I witnessed this crew engage in extraordinary efforts to assist a man who had been shot repeatedly... At all times, these firefighters were professional and focused on the task of helping the victim. My experience reminded me of what a hard job (both mentally and physically) we as a City ask our firefighters to do. The staff on duty during my visit deserve any accolades and commendations that come their way...."" --Tina Podlodowski, Seattle City Council/ Public Safety Committee         Editor:  Sheila Strehle  To submit articles or ideas to  Fire Scene  call 386-1463.

The plant, however, uses only a fraction of the site with 733 acres devoted to a National Wildlife Refuge. In March 2002, a hole was discovered in the head of the reactor vessel, resulting in the shutdown of this unit. *  As of June 2003, the reactor has not yet been re-started.      In 2001, Unit 1 had a capacity factor of 100.5 percent and supplied 7.68 billion kilowatthours of electricity. The plant is operated by FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company and owned by  FirstEnergy .       Sources:  Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, ""Annual Electric Generator Report."" Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Blaha  Assistant for Operations, OEDO        Contact:  G. Tracy, OEDO       ENCLOSURE A    Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    DPV on the NRC Operator Licensing Examination Process    An NRR DPV Review Panel reviewed a Differing Professional View (DPV) submitted regarding an Operator Licensing Branch (HOLB) decision to disallow the region the opportunity to develop and provide the sample plan used for development of the initial operator licensing examinations at reactor facilities. The operator licensing initial examination process is undergoing major changes concerning who will develop and administer the NRC initial examination. The proposed change to  10 CFR Part 55 , that was published for public comment in August 1997, requires that the licensee develop initial examinations in accordance with NUREG-1021, Interim Revision 8 of the Examiner Standards. In this process the licensee develops the examination with final approval of the NRC. The concern raised in the DPV was the possibility that a licensee could skew an examination sample plan such that the knowledge, skills and abilities are not systematically covered. The written examination sample plan lists the required knowledge topics or subject areas to be tested. NUREG-1021 Appendix A states that when samples are not chosen systematically, the sample is biased and validity is reduced. This may allow a licensee to eliminate examination questions in areas that were not adequately covered in their training program and they may not sample the 10 CFR Part 55 topics properly to make a licensing decision. In a recent report on interaction (ROI), Region II requested that HOLB allow the regions to develop and provide the sample plan to the licensee. In HOLB's reply to the ROI, they stated that the regions are not authorized to generate examination outlines for facility use, nor does HOLB plan to amend the pilot process to allow or require regions to prepare examination outlines for anything other than NRC-prepared examinations.    The NRR DPV Review Panel concluded that this was an example of a vulnerability in allowing the licensee to develop the sample plan that needs to be addressed, however they did not agree that the only solution was to have the regions develop the sample plan. The panel recommended that the staff provide further guidance in the examiner standards to ensure that licensees have followed a uniform systematic process for examination question selection and that exams have been prepared in an unbiased manner. The panel also recommended the staff consider issuing an Information Notice to alert licensees and a report on interaction to alert regional staff to the expectation that the process for developing an examination sample plan shall be scrutable, systematic and consistent with the requirements to ensure exam validity. The appropriate organizations in NRR have been tasked with completing the panel's recommended action items within scheduled due dates.    Suppression Pool Bypass and SGTS Failure Through Containment Purge Valves    This year, approximately a dozen Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) sites have reported the potential for bypassing the suppression pool and/or damaging the Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS) if a Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) occurs while purging the containment.    Simultaneous purging of the drywell and wetwell while inserting the containment during startup, or de-inserting during shutdown, combined with a single electrical failure which leaves two purge valves open during a LOCA, could open a path from the drywell to the wetwell air space, allowing steam to bypass the suppression pool. In many cases, this could over pressurize the containment (wetwell).    Also, purge flow is usually directed through the SGTS. If large (approximately 18-24 inch) purge valves are being used, as during inserting and de-inserting, the initial surge of air and steam into the SGTS from a LOCA could over pressurize and rupture the low-pressure SGTS ductwork downstream of the purge valves before the valves close, potentially disabling the SGTS and, consequently, the secondary containment function.    Generally, both of these are low-probability events because of the limited amount of time that these operations are conducted (usually during startup and shutdown of the reactor). Also, the second event is addressed by the SRP and in many plants SERs and licensing bases. Further, the suppression pool bypass event may exceed containment design pressure, but probably not the containment's ultimate capacity, which may be 2 to 3 times the design pressure.    General Electric has notified all affected plants about the suppression pool bypass problem. For both problems, plants are taking short-term corrective actions, generally procedural changes to avoid purging in vulnerable configurations, and are pursuing long-term fixes, such as re-analysis and plant modifications.    The staff is preparing an Information Notice to alert licensees to these problems. This is being done to close TAC No. M98125 issued by PECB to evaluate this generic concern.    NRC/ASME/NB Coordinating Committee Meeting    On December 18, 1997, representatives from NRR and RES participated in the semi-annual meeting between NRC, ASME senior staff, and the National Board. The principal focus of this committee meeting is policy issues of mutual interest to ASME and NRC. Items of interest include:        The committee reviewed the progress of the ASME Special Working Group (SWG) on Seismic Design that is examining the 1995 Code piping design rules that have been found unacceptable by the staff. NRC advised the Coordinating Committee that, since the technical insights developed by the NRC contractor have been provided to the SWG and the SWG is considering proposed approaches to changing the piping design rules, our liaison activities with the SWG will be reduced and we will continue our interaction via our representatives to the standing code committees.         The recent  10 CFR 50.55a  proposed rulemaking that was issued for public comment on December 3, was discussed. The ASME plans to coordinate comments from their committees and provide them to the NRC.         ASME continues to remain interested in activities to speed NRC rulemaking and their actions to improve the consensus process. DSI-13 was discussed and RES summarized our activities in this area. ASME expressed interest in the 1998 stakeholder meetings.         ASME work on the risk management initiative was discussed. The proposed scope of a new standard is being considered by the Board on Nuclear Codes and Standards. A task group (chaired by R. Simard of NEI and including M. Drouin as the NRC representative) will be preparing this standard. It is expected to be circulated outside of ASME to other consensus bodies during the development process. Target completion date is December 1998.         ASME actions to deal with fatigue and transient monitoring were discussed. This activity, being conducted by a task group composed of members from Section III and Section XI, is still defining the scope of the issue and the limitations of the existing code language. NRC encouraged continued effort by this group, as the issue was raised over 2 years ago.         Threaded fasteners were discussed, including the need for revision to code language. A proposed change to Section III will be sent to the ASME for referral to the Subcommittee on Nuclear Power.         Other discussion items included steam generator issues, risk-informed initiatives, reactor vessel issues, procurement of replacement components, ASME international activities, and  GL 96-06  status.      Nine Mile Point, Unit 2    On January 7, 1998, the licensee requested enforcement discretion to preclude shutdown of Unit 2 with both divisions of the reactor coolant system leakage detection system temporarily inoperable. The Division 2 monitoring channel exhibited erratic behavior and was declared inoperable at 4:30 a.m. January 7, 1998, during a time when Division 1 was out for servicing. Both failures were attributed to moisture in the sensing lines. Without the ability to detect particulate or gaseous radioactivity in the drywell by normal means, the licensee determined that Unit 2 was in a TS 3.0.3 condition, which would require the plant to begin an orderly shutdown by 11:30 a.m. The licensee is monitoring drywell activity every 12 hours based on grab samples. The licensee noted that the Improved TSs (the conversion submittal is expected during the first half of 1998) would not require shutdown, but would require filing a report within 30 days. The licensee requested an extension of time, until 9:00 a.m. January 8, 1998, to restore the containment monitoring system to service without shutting down. A Notice of Enforcement Discretion was granted by Region I with NRR concurrence.    Beaver Valley Power Station, Units 1 and 2    Both Beaver Valley reactors are currently in cold shutdown. Unit 1 is in day 101 of a planned refueling outage (original schedule 40 days). Unit 1 returned to cold shutdown from hot standby over the past weekend due to the discovery of item 3 below. Three primary issues require resolution prior to Unit 1 restart as follows:                  (1)   Complete operational turnover of a design change which installed an upgraded CE Rod Position Indication system during the refueling outage.                    (2)   DBA control room habitability dose calculations in support of current TS were non-bounding. Complete  10 CFR 50.59  safety evaluation for a UFSAR revision which will place more restrictive limits on faulted SG leakage which is the major contributor to control room dose for the limiting accident.                    (3)   Resolve a potential 1EEE-384 Class 1E/non-class 1E separation issue regarding components located in the secondary process racks which provide safety- and non-safety related functions. This principally involves Westinghouse 7100 series logic modules.        Unit 2 performed a TS-required shutdown on December 16, 1997, due to the control room emergency ventilation system not meeting single failure design criteria. Two primary issues require resolution prior to Unit 2 restart as follow:                  (1)   Complete several safety evaluations and associated design changes as necessary to satisfy single failure criteria for the control room emergency ventilation system.                    (2)   Same as item (3) for Unit 1 above, but principally involves Westinghouse 7300 logic series cards.        The resident staff and a Region I-based engineering inspection team are on site monitoring licensee activities.    Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2    On January 5, 1998, PECO issued a news release announcing that PECO Nuclear, a unit of PECO Energy Company, has been selected by Illinois Power Company (IPC) to manage IPC's Clinton Power Station in Clinton, IL, on a contract basis, effective January 5, 1998.    The initial contract is expected to be for three years, with option for renewal. It will involve a PECO Nuclear management team, headed by Walter G. MacFarland, current vice president of PECO Energy's Limerick Generating Station, who will be chief nuclear officer at Clinton, reporting directly to IPC Chairman Larry D. Haab. Mr. Haab stated that although the PECO Nuclear team will manage the plant, IPC will continue to own the facility and maintain the license for its operation.    The 950 megawatt boiling water reactor has been shut down for a variety of operational and maintenance problems since September 1996.    Wolf Creek    On January 6, 1998, Senator Brownback of Kansas visited Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station. There was no NRC involvement in the visit. According to the licensee, the Senator was interested in high-level waste issues and requested a tour of the spent fuel pool area, and discussed with the licensee the proposed low-level waste compact with the state of Nebraska.       ENCLOSURE B    Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    Disposition of Department of Energy Owned Fissile Materials    Staff from the Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards received a request from the Department of Energy ( DOE ) for assistance in confirming the quantity of uranium-233 that DOE believes is located at five Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensee sites. Uranium-233 is one of the nuclear materials that DOE has identified for long-term stabilization and ultimate disposition pursuant to the directive from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and DOE is in the process of formulating a plan to accomplish these objectives. Staff agreed to contact the identified licensees to confirm the DOE data.    Meeting with Guard Union at Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant    On January 6, 1998, the Director of the Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards, along with representatives from the Division of Facilities and Security and Region III, represented the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at a meeting with the United Plant Guard Workers of America Local 66.    The meeting also included representatives of the Department of Energy from Headquarters, Oak Ridge and the Portsmouth site, the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, Lockheed Martin Energy Services, and Lockheed Martin Utility Services. The collective group addressed protective force concerns and jurisdictional questions.    Holtec HI-STAR 100 Drop Test at Oak Ridge National Laboratory    On December 30, 1997, staff from the Spent Fuel Project Office went to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to observe a 1/4-scale, 30-foot drop test for the Holtec HI-STAR 100 dual purpose cask. During a previous drop test performed on December 11, 1997, with the ""side-drop"" or horizontal orientation, the bolts attaching the bottom impact limiter to the cask failed, allowing the impact limiter to separate from the cask. Holtec subsequently modified the bottom impact limiter design. In the latest 30-foot drop test, with the ""slap-down"" orientation, the cask was released 15 degrees from horizontal, with the top striking the ground first. This orientation subjected the bottom impact limiter to greater deceleration than the top impact limiter.    Preliminary observations from the drop test indicate that the bolts on the bottom impact limiter remained intact, and the impact limiter did not separate from the cask. Additional test details will be available from Holtec in the near future.    Closure of Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Bulletin 96-04 , ""Chemical, Galvanic, or Other Reactions in Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation Casks""    On December 29, 1997, the Spent Fuel Project Office (SFPO) closed out Nuclear Regulatory Commission Bulletin 96-04. The bulletin was issued on July 5, 1996, following a hydrogen gas ignition event at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant during the loading of a VSC-24 cask. The hydrogen was generated by a chemical reaction between the cask's zinc-based coating and the borated spent fuel pool water. The bulletin was issued to confirm that this type of reaction was not a concern for other spent fuel storage and transportation cask designs. The SFPO staff, with assistance from the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, reviewed 40 responses to the bulletin. These responses addressed 28 different cask designs. Based on the responses, the potential for adverse reactions was identified for three of the 28 cask designs. The staff is taking follow-up actions for these three cask designs.       ENCLOSURE C    Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    Fuel Behavior    A special issue on reactivity accidents with high-burnup fuel has been published in the  Nuclear Safety  journal. In late 1993, a test with a high-burnup fuel rod in a French test reactor (CABRI) failed under conditions far below those used in regulation for reactivity accidents. That test led to  Information Notice 94-64  and a hold on approving further burnup extensions in NRC-licensed plants. Subsequently, RES made formal arrangements to obtain data from the CABRI test reactor, the NSRR test reactor (Japan), and the IGR test reactor (Russia) and conducted numerous technical discussions on reactivity accidents with EPRI. In 1996, RES made arrangements for a special issue of the  Nuclear Safety  journal to present five papers on research results and assessments prepared by principal investigators from these programs (CABRI, NSRR, IGR, EPRI, and RES), and that special issue has just been published. The papers from France, Japan, and Russia summarize recent results from their test reactor programs and provide interpretation of those results. The EPRI paper presents an assessment of the test data based largely on computer code calculations. The RES paper presents a more empirical assessment of the test data and provides the basis for recently proposed interim criteria for analysis of reactivity accidents with high-burnup fuel. The NRC is considering the adoption of interim licensing criteria and is planning to support additional work in the French and Japanese test reactors.    Reactor Pressure Vessel Lower Head Failure Experiments at Sandia National Laboratories    The lower head of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) can be subject to significant thermal and pressure loads in the late phases of core melting during a severe accident. An understanding of the mode, timing, and size of lower head failure is important in the evaluation of the consequences of a severe accident because it defines the initial conditions for many of the subsequent challenges to containment integrity. Lower head failure (LHF) tests are being conducted at the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The 7th test (LHF-7) was conducted successfully at the SNL on December 19, 1997. The purpose of this test was to examine the effect of lower pressure on creep rupture failure of a reactor pressure vessel. In this test (which was conducted at 725 psig versus previous tests at 1450 psig) the failure occurred at approximately 1200K (17000 F) as compared to about 1050K (14300 F) for previous higher pressure tests (i.e., 2700 F higher than those observed in previous tests). The failure also produced a smaller hole in the RPV than previous higher pressure tests. Such results need to be considered in assessing accident management strategies related to reactor coolant system pressure. Data from these experiments will be used to assess and validate analytical models of RPV lower head failure.    Regulatory Guides Issued Recently    Draft Regulatory Guide DG-5008 (Proposed Revision 2 of Regulatory Guide 5.62), ""Reporting of Safeguards Events""    Draft Regulatory Guide  DG-1071 , ""Standard Format and Content for Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report""INSERT TEXT HERE       ENCLOSURE D    Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    Engineering Evaluation, AEOD/E97-03, ""Nuclear Power Plant Cold Weather Problems and Protective Measures""    A significant Accident Sequence Precursor (with a conditional core damage probability of 2 E-4) occurred at the Wolf Creek Generating Station on January 30, 1996. It involved icing of cooling water intake trash racks and traveling screens, subsequent loss of an essential service water system train and an auxiliary feedwater pump, and other plant complications. This event led AEOD to evaluate the extent of cold weather related problems at other nuclear power plants over the past 6 years. A search of nuclear power plant operating experience from January 1991 through April 1997 identified events involving ice, freezing, and low ambient temperature conditions affecting intake structures; process lines; instrument lines; emergency diesel generators; essential chillers; electrical systems; and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. This report describes 37 such events at 23 different sites. All other cold weather events except at Wolf Creek were not found to be quantitatively risk significant. Nevertheless many of the events were preventable. Ice formed in a diesel generator service water pump column. Frazil ice formed in the cooling water intakes of three plants. A common safety injection recirculation line froze making the system inoperable. Refueling water and condensate storage tanks' level transmitter lines with inadequate insulation or heat tracing froze. Emergency diesel generators became inoperable because of oil and grease viscosity problems. Inadequately sealed electrical conduit and cabinets caused partial losses of onsite or offsite power. Lack of design oversight, incomplete review of operating experience, and insufficient attention to cold weather preparations caused most of these events. Most importantly, the report identifies preventive and corrective actions licensees have taken to protect against cold weather operational events.    Primary Coolant System Leak Study    On December 18, 1997, AEOD distributed a draft of the Assessment of Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Primary System Leaks report to other NRC offices and industry for peer review. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of U.S. experience related to PWR primary system leaks, their rates, and trends; the safety significance of such leakages; and assessment of current leak detection methods.    The assessment was based on a review of licensee event reports related to leak events from January 1985 to September 1996, visits to PWR plants, and reviews of related licensee failure analyses and technical literature. The report presents findings in the following seven areas: (1) trends of annual rates of primary coolant leaks, (2) degradation mechanisms and failure modes that have caused primary coolant leaks, (3) locations and types of leaks, (4) leaks that have a potential for relatively rapid growth, (5) safety significance of piping fatigue, (6) leak events that may be regarded as core damage precursors, and (7) effectiveness of current leakage detection systems.

On December 12, 1997, Whittaker Corporation, requested that the date for compliance with Item 1 of the CAL be extended to January 31, 1998. Item 1 stated, ""By December 19, 1997, ensure that all licensed material outside your controlled fenced area has been recovered and is controlled within a fenced area of your property."" Whittaker requested this extension due to the adverse weather conditions at the site. The CAL was amended on December 19, 1997 extending the date for compliance with Item 1 to January 31, 1998.       ENCLOSURE P    Region II  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    Duke Energy Corporation - Oconee Unit 1 - Update to December 28 Shutdown    Following discussions with the steam generator vendor, the licensee announced their plans to re-roll approximately 1700 tubes in the outer three peripheral rows of the 1A steam generator due to concerns that allowable accident leakage rates would be exceeded during a main steam line break.    Pressure testing of the 1B steam generator revealed minor leakage from welded tube plug.    Duke Energy Corporation - Oconee Station SALP    The Regional Administrator presented the results of the Oconee Nuclear Station Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) for the period of May 5, 1996, to November 15, 1997 at the site on January 8, 1998. A decline in the Plant Operations and Engineering ratings was attributed to deficiencies in human performance, procedural controls, problem identification and resolution, and technical support.    Following the SALP presentation a separate meeting was held with State and Local officials to discuss activities at Oconee Station.    The Region II and NRR staff also attended a separate meeting, also open to the public, which addressed several licensee initiatives described in the Duke Oconee Recovery Plan, to address performance issues at the site.    TRI-State Enforcement Conference    An enforcement conference was held with the licensee on January 6, 1998, to discuss two apparent violations associated with the security of licensed material and the transfer of licensed material to a person not authorized to receive the material. On January 8, 1998, Region II issued a Notice of Violation (Severity Level III problem, No CP). The CP was mitigated because the licensee had no prior escalated enforcement action and the corrective actions taken by the licensee.       ENCLOSURE P    Region III  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    Predecisional Enforcement Conference with Commonwealth Edison Company - Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station    On January 9, 1998, a Predecisional Enforcement Conference was conducted in the Region III Office, Lisle, Illinois, between management representatives of Commonwealth Edison Company and members of the NRC staff. The conference was conducted to discuss the apparent failure by the utility to perform a required leakage test of the reactor vessel and certain piping systems before starting up Quad Cities Unit 2 in June of 1997. The utility did not perform the test until seven days later. During an inspection in November and December 1997, NRC inspectors found several instances where the utility inadequately implemented or missed other examinations or leakage tests. Inspectors also noted that the utility did not perform an adequate safety review of starting up the unit prior to completing the test. NRC Regional Administrator A. Bill Beach participated in the conference.    American Electric Power Management Meeting - D.C. Cook Nuclear Power Station    On January 8, 1998, a meeting was conducted in the Region III Office, Lisle, Illinois, between management representatives from American Electric Power Company and members of the NRC staff. The meeting discussed issues related to the recent NRC architect engineering inspection in November 1997 and the associated Confirmatory Action Letter dated September 9, 1997. NRC Regional Administrator A. Bill Beach participated in the meeting.    Management Meeting with Illinois Power Company - Clinton Plant    On January 8, 1998, a management meeting was conducted at the Clinton Nuclear Power Plant, Clinton, Illinois, between management representatives of Illinois Power Company and members of the NRC staff. The utility discussed its improvement plans and the plant's current performance.    Illinois Power Company Management Changes -- Clinton Plant    On January 5, 1998, Illinois Power announced that it had selected PECO Energy Company, operator of the Peach Bottom and Limerick nuclear stations, to provide management services for the Clinton Nuclear Power Plant. PECO Energy will provide six to eight managers to fill key positions at the Clinton plant, including Chief Nuclear Officer and Plant Manager.    Walter G. MacFarland, IV, vice president of PECO's Limerick Station, is Clinton's Chief Nuclear Officer. The other positions have not yet been filled. A PECO team is onsite to begin an assessment of the Clinton facility and operations.    The management services contract is for a three-year period with the option for a five-year extension. Illinois Power will continue to maintain the NRC license for the facility and retain ultimate oversight of the plant. The Chief Nuclear Officer will report to the Illinois Power Chief Executive Officer.    Meeting with Ohio Department of Health    On January 6, 1998, NRC Region III staff members met with representatives from the Ohio Department of Health in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss Ohio's request for a Low-Level Radioactive Waste Memorandum of Understanding with the NRC and the status of Ohio's pursuit of Agreement State status.       ENCLOSURE P    Region IV  Items of Interest  Week Ending January 9, 1998    Callaway Plant    A management meeting with representatives of the Callaway plant was held in the Region IV office on January 6, 1998.

ENCLOSURE A    Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation  Items of Interest  Week Ending October 6, 2000    Staff Issues ANO-1 License Renewal Draft Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement for Public Comment    On October 3, 2000, the staff issued the draft of Supplement 3 to NUREG-1437, ""Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, Supplement 3, Regarding Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1,"" for public comment. This supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) includes the staff's preliminary analysis that considers and weighs the environmental effects of the proposed action, the environmental impacts of alternatives to the proposed action, and mitigative measures available for reducing or avoiding adverse impacts. It also includes the staff's preliminary recommendation regarding the proposed action. A 75-day public comment period is scheduled to begin on or about October 20, 2000, with the Notice of Filing of the draft SEIS with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The staff has scheduled public meetings on November 14, 2000, in Russellville, Arkansas, to present its analyses and to accept public comments on the draft SEIS.    Public Meeting on Public and Occupational Radiation Safety Cornerstones    On September 27, 2000, members of the Emergency Preparedness and Health Physics Section, IOLB, participated in a public meeting with NEI to discuss issues in the Public and Occupational Radiation Safety Cornerstones of the Reactor Oversight Program (ROP). A bridge line was established to allow NRC regional personnel and industry representatives to participate. There was good, productive discussion on the following items; proposed changes to the Transportation/Part 61 significance determination process (SDP), development of additional guidance in the SDP for the Radioactive Material Control portion of Inspection Manual Chapter 0609, and building consensus on frequently asked questions in the Occupational area. A follow-up meeting will be scheduled for November to hear feedback from radiation protection managers on the ROP.         ENCLOSURE B    Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards   Items of Interest   Week Ending October 6, 2000    NUREG/CR-6682    NUREG/CR-6682 has been published to document public input on issues associated with alternative courses of action for control of solid materials that have very low amounts of, or no, radioactivity at Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) licensed facilities. As part of this effort, the NRC conducted an enhanced participatory process to evaluate the possible alternative courses of action. In addition to written public comments, NRC held a series of public meetings during the Fall of 1999 in San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; and Rockville, Maryland. Extensive and wide-ranging comments were received at the four public meetings and in the written public comments. NUREG/CR-6682 provides a digest of the public comments received from individuals and organizations, as well as those from participants at the public workshops. Over 900 written comment letters were received, in addition to those summarized from the public meeting transcripts. Most of these comments focus on the specific technical approach or criteria that should be developed. No analysis or response to comments is included in this report.    Staff Participation in Organization of Agreement States Meeting    On October 2-4, 2000, staff from the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) participated in the annual meeting of the Organization of Agreement States held in Charleston, South Carolina. NMSS staff gave presentations on a variety of topics, including decommissioning (finality, license termination standards, restricted release, guidance development, rubblization), rulemakings in progress (entombment, clearance,  10 CFR Part 40  revisions,  Part 34 ,  Part 35  and the medical pilot, and  Part 71 ), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's current views on the regulation of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program.    Coordination Meeting with Department of Energy on Safeguards and Emergency Response    On October 4, 2000, the Director of the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS), met with the Director of the Office of Security and Emergency Operations, U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE    ). The Director of NMSS was accompanied by other managers from NMSS and the Deputy Director of Incident Response Operations. The purpose of the visit was to discuss topics of mutual interest, including the design basis threat, agency commitments to ensure comparability of physical protection for strategic special nuclear material, and emergency response assets provided by DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Organizational changes are anticipated within DOE and NNSA as a result of Congressional direction in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for FY 2001. Follow-up discussions are planned after the staff consults with the Commission on the process for developing the Adversary Characteristics Document in November 2000.    BWX Technologies, Inc.    On September 19, 2000, BWX Technologies, Inc. (BWXT), determined that a water leak exists in their Cask Handling Area Pool (CHAP) at their Lynchburg Technology Center in Lynchburg, Virginia. The CHAP contains approximately 56,000 gallons of water and the leak is estimated to be approximately 250 gallons per day. The CHAP is used to store irradiated commercial reactor hardware and fuel rods. The average concentrations of the key isotopes in the CHAP are 9E-05 microcuries per milliliter for cesium-137 (90 times the concentration allowed by 10 CFR Part 20 for liquid releases to an unrestricted area), and 7E-06 microcuries per milliliter for cobalt-60 (2.3 times the concentration allowed by Part 20 for liquid releases to an unrestricted area). Using conservative assumptions (no dilution before entering the James River which is about 0.3 miles away and the path for the water has no non-BWXT property in its path), the dose to a member of the public drinking James River water would be less than 1 millirem per year. Based on this calculated dose, the risk significance is very low. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) BWXT Senior Resident Inspector and other NRC staff continue to monitor the licensee's actions to stop the leak and assess the environmental impact. During the week of October 2, 2000, the licensee installed monitoring wells. Media attention has occurred.    Meeting with U.S. Enrichment Corporation on Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant Higher Assay Operations    On October 3, 2000, management and staff from the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards and Region III met with representatives from the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) to discuss licensing issues associated with an upcoming certificate amendment request. USEC plans to submit an amendment request to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to revise the Paducah certificate to increase its enrichment from 2.75% to 5.5%. The objectives of the meeting were to:  (1) discuss the status and schedule for the review; (2) emphasize previous commitments of both parties to support an accelerated schedule; and (3) discuss any issues which have arisen to date. Both parties agreed to continue to have similar meetings throughout the amendment review process to support the accelerated review schedule.    Nuclear Energy Institute    On September 30, 2000, the Nuclear Energy Institute submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission a revision to Appendix B of NEI 96-07. This appendix provides guidance to licensees and vendors for implementation of the amended  10 CFR Part 72.48 , ""Changes, Tests, and Experiments."" The revision to Appendix B was prepared in response to Spent Fuel Project Office (SFPO) staff comments on a June 15, 2000, version of the document and also included changes based on applicable updated sections of the final guidance document for implementation of  Part 50.59 . SFPO staff is reviewing the submittal and will begin preparation of a regulatory guide which will endorse the final version of the guidance document.    Meeting with Packaging Technology    On October 4, 2000, Spent Fuel Project Office staff met with Packaging Technology, Inc., to discuss the design of the mixed oxide (MOX) fresh fuel package. The package will be used by the Department of Energy (DOE) to transport MOX fresh fuel from a planned MOX fuel fabrication facility to certain commercial power plants. The use of MOX fuel is part of DOE's plutonium disposition program in the United States. Packaging Technology plans to begin full-scale prototype testing of the package in September 2001 and submit a license application in 2002. Additional meetings are anticipated to further discuss issues regarding the package design.    Nuclear Regulatory Commission Staff Issued Safety Evaluation Report on Proposed Spent Fuel Storage Facility in Utah    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff issued its safety evaluation report (SER) on Private Fuel Storage's (PFS's) application to build a spent fuel storage facility on the Reservation of the Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians near Tooele County, Utah. In its June 20, 1997, application, PFS proposed to store spent fuel generated from commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. for a twenty-year period above ground in large casks. The review found that the facility and the casks that would store the spent fuel would be safe and meet regulatory requirements.    The SER also concludes that the application demonstrates the proposed facility would satisfy applicable Commission safety requirements during normal, unusual, and accident conditions. Among the hazards analyzed by PFS were a cask drop, flood, fire, lightning, earthquake, and tornadoes. In addition, hazards from nearby activities also were considered, including explosions and aircraft crashes. Issuance of the safety evaluation report marks another step in the safety and environmental review in the on-going licensing process required by the NRC.         ENCLOSURE C    Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research  Items of Interest  Week Ending October 6, 2000    Meeting on Educational Infrastructure for Nuclear Technology    On September 18, Margaret Federline, Deputy Director, Office of Research, attended a meeting of the nation's engineering deans hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology. This meeting discussed the national need for a viable educational infrastructure for nuclear technology and specifically focused on the results of a ""Blue Ribbon Panel"" Report on the Future of Nuclear Engineering. In a discussion session with Undersecretary Moniz of DOE, participants emphasized the need for a national vision for nuclear technology and the need for innovative approaches to sustain the educational infrastructure.    The report points out that the number of independent nuclear engineering programs and the number of operating university nuclear reactors have both fallen by about half since the mid-80s. In contrast, the demand for nuclear-trained personnel is again on the rise with the aging of the workforce and the potential for license renewal at a majority of U.S. plants. The Blue Ribbon Panel was established by the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee to address the future of nuclear engineering programs, establish a process to support university research and training reactors, and identify appropriate collaborations between DOE national laboratories and university programs. Among the report's recommendations are that DOE increase the graduate student pipeline through increased scholarship support, assist universities in recruiting new faculty by establishing a junior faculty grant program, institute a competitive peer-reviewed university reactors research award program, and increase personnel exchanges between national laboratories and universities.    Release of SCDAP/RELAP5 MOD 3.3    On September 29, 2000, RES released the newest version of the SCDAP/RELAP5 severe accident analysis code, MOD 3.3. The SCDAP/RELAP5 code has been developed for best-estimate transient simulation of light water reactor coolant systems during a severe accident. New models in MOD 3.3 include (1) an integral diffusion model for oxidation of fuel rod cladding, (2) a stress-based model for failure of oxide layer containing melted metallic cladding, (3) a model for re-slumping of previously slumped and frozen cladding, (4) a model for cracking of cladding oxide layer during reflood conditions and the effect of cracking on oxygen transport, (5) models for flow losses and heat transfer in porous debris, (6) a model for heat transfer in a molten pool that has stratified into oxidic and metallic parts, and (7) a model for break-up of jets of molten material slumping into a pool of water.    This new version of the SCDAP/RELAP5 was assessed using data from a wide range of fuel damage experiments and the TMI-2 accident. The assessment showed that calculations of the axial distribution in oxidation and meltdown of fuel assemblies and the behavior of fuel assemblies under reflood conditions were improved by the new models in MOD 3.3. The assessment showed that MOD 3.3 calculates a more rapid onset of severe fuel damage under severe accident conditions than that calculated by the previous version of the code. The assessment also showed that MOD 3.3 can analyze severe fuel damage experiments, as well as nuclear power plant response to severe accidents, with a single set of models for the phenomena causing damage to fuel assemblies.    Public Meeting on Concrete Coatings Research    A public meeting was held on September 26, 2000, at NRC Headquarters to present recent research results for a Service Level I concrete coating system applied in PWRs when the coating had been subjected to simulated conditions that would be expected after a design basis accident. Attendees included NEI, EPRI, BWROG, ASTM, WOG, and other stakeholders. The RES contractor presented research results on the potential for coating failure that could result in the formation of debris that could impact the operation of PWR emergency core cooling systems. The Industry Coatings PIRT Panel (industry coatings specialists) presented their views on the significance of coating degradation phenomena that had not previously been observed.    Research showed that non-irradiation-aged specimens do not fail and produce debris. However, when coating specimens were irradiated to a total dose of 10 9  RAD and subjected to a plant-specific temperature/pressure environment (representative of that after a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA)) or water immersion at 200 0 F, failure occurred within a 0.002"" depth in the topcoat (Phenoline 305) material.    This meeting provided an open forum for reporting new phenomena and resulted in discussion regarding (1) the application of results to operational PWRs, (2) the need to re-visit previous qualification testing and acceptance of results, (3) the need to review the ASTM Standards that these research results may affect, and (4) research needed to better understand the synergistic environmental effects. Attendees were encouraged to submit additional views and research recommendations by e-mail to facilitate development of a path forward plan.    High-Temperature Oxidation Testing on High-Burnup Fuel    High-burnup BWR fuel from the Limerick plant arrived at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in May and, after preliminary characterization, oxidation kinetics measurements are now under way and giving good results. Oxidation kinetics and other measurements are made on high-burnup fuel at ANL to provide data for confirming or modifying fuel damage criteria in  10 CFR 50.46  and evaluation models in Appendix K for the loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCA). Issues related to the behavior of high-burnup fuel during a LOCA were identified in an agency program plan (EDO to Commissioners 7/6/98) and were the subject of a later information notice ( IN 98-29 ). Other measurements planned at ANL include quench resistance and post-quench ductility under LOCA conditions, along with general mechanical properties of high-burnup cladding, creep rates under dry storage conditions, and radionuclide inventories for burnup credit analysis. However, it will take several years to generate a useful database for Zircaloy-clad fuel currently in use in PWRs and BWRs, and additional data will be required for the newer cladding alloys, ZIRLO and M5. As a separate note, there are still delays in receiving high-burnup PWR fuel rods from the H. B. Robinson plant.    Draft Guides on Occupational Health at Uranium Recovery Facilities    RES has issued proposed revisions to two regulatory guides.  Draft Regulatory Guide DG-8026   , ""Health Physics Surveys in Uranium Recovery Facilities,"" is being developed as a proposed Revision 1 of Regulatory Guide 8.30 to describe health physics surveys that are acceptable to the NRC staff for protecting workers at uranium recovery facilities from radiation and from the chemical toxicity of uranium while on the job.  Draft Regulatory Guide DG-8027   , ""Information Relevant to Ensuring that Occupational Radiation Exposures at Uranium Recovery Facilities Will Be As Low As Is Reasonably Achievable,"" is being developed as a proposed Revision 1 to Regulatory Guide 8.31 to provide guidance on design criteria and administrative practices acceptable to the NRC staff for maintaining occupational exposures as low as is reasonably achievable in uranium recovery facilities.         ENCLOSURE D    Incident Response Operations  Items of Interest  Week Ending October 6, 2000    State Outreach in Florida    On September 27, 2000, IRO organized and conducted State and Federal Outreach training in Dade County, Florida. This Outreach training was arranged in response to a request from the Dade County Director of Emergency Services. Issues discussed included Federal resources in support of State and local organizations for a radiological emergency. Presenters included the NRC,  FEMA     (Region IV), DOE,  USDA , the State of Florida Radiation Health and Emergency Services, Dade County, and a representative from Turkey Point.

The NRC currently cross-services its core accounting function with FMS. The OCFO is currently investigating options for replacing the core accounting service provided by FMS. Due to the time constraint, the mostly likely option is to enter into another cross-service agreement with another agency. OCFO has previously determined that it will not consider the purchase of another core accounting system until after FY 2002. This unbudgeted conversion to another core accounting system would occur in FY2001 and FY 2002.

These issues include adequate guidance on (1) SSCs in the scope of 10 CFR 50.65(a)(4), (2) managing risk due to maintenance, and (3) an acceptable definition of unavailability. The NRC and NEI staff presented their views on these issues and substantial progress was made on clarifications needed in Section 11 to address them. The NRC staff plans to have a draft Regulatory Guide, by December 1999, that would endorse the NEI guidance with possible exceptions.       ENCLOSURE B    Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards  Items of Interest  Week Ending November 5, 1999    Preliminary Certificate of Compliance and Safety Evaluation Report for NAC-UMS Universal Storage System Completed    The Spent Fuel Project Office staff has completed its review of the safety analysis report submitted by NAC International Inc. (NAC) for the UMS Universal Storage System (NAC-UMS).    The NAC-UMS system is a transport-compatible dry storage system that uses a stainless steel transportable storage canister stored within the central cavity of a vertical concrete cask. It is designed to store up to 24 pressurized water reactor or up to 56 boiling water reactor spent fuel assemblies. The storage canister is also designed to be compatible with the NAC-UMS transport cask, which is under review.    The staff's preliminary certificate of compliance and safety evaluation report will be made available for public comment. This is the first step in the rulemaking process to include the NAC-UMS in the list of casks available for use by holders of general licenses pursuant to  10 CFR Part 72 . The first anticipated use of the NAC-UMS will be during the decommissioning of the Maine Yankee site in Spring 2001.    Department of Veterans Affairs National Radiation Safety Committee Meeting    On October 28, 1999, a staff member of the Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety attended the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) National Radiation Safety Committee (NRSC) meeting as an observer. The NRSC approved the National Health Physics Program (NHPP) Director's plan and milestones for the implementation of a centrally controlled program. (The plan and milestones were requested by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in a letter dated May 4, 1999, to Dr. Kiser, Under Secretary for Health, as a prerequisite for a meeting with NRC management. This letter put NRC's review of DVA's master materials license (MML) application on hold pending the meeting with Dr. Kiser and implementation of the DVA centrally controlled radiation safety program.) The NHPP Director briefed the committee on their progress in implementing the program, e.g., review of licensing actions, inspections, internal enforcement actions, and general progress on the MML application. The staff expects to receive a request from DVA within two months for a management meeting with NRC to discuss DVA progress.    Third Public Meeting on Control of Solid Materials    On November 1-2, 1999, the Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear    Safety held the third of four facilitated public meetings to discuss issues    and alternatives related to control of solid materials at licensed facilities    at Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Headquarters. Attendance at the meeting    included representatives from citizens groups, licensees and licensee organizations,    the medical community, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of    Energy ( DOE   ),    state agencies, tribal governments, scrap and recycling companies, and steel    manufacturers. The meeting agenda consisted of eight sessions corresponding    to the content of the Issues Paper.    Several attendees noted that: (1) a national standard would be useful to provide consistency in licensing approach; (2) there is a need to consider DOE materials; and (3) there is also a need to consider the variety of materials that move in and out of facilities every day.    Some attendees were concerned that the outcome of this rule is already pre-determined, questioned whether release of material by MSC in Tennessee is lawful, and also questioned NRC's oversight of Tennessee. One concern expressed was that NRC's contractor on technical basis development, Science Application International Corporation, should not work on further reports because of conflict of interest problems arising from their work on BNFL, and also indicated that Draft NUREG-1640 should be withdrawn because of these conflict of interest issues. The staff is currently reviewing these issues.    Some considerations regarding potential alternatives expressed by attendees included: (1) steel manufacturers indicated that no radioactive steel should be released into recycle because of concerns over potential economic disruption if their consumers do not want their products, and because of past problems with orphan sources in incoming materials; (2) the Health Physics Society noted that it has a position paper supporting ANSI N13.12 and suggested NRC consider adopting the ANSI standard which contains criteria for clearance of material; and (3) some attendees opposed any further release of material into unrestricted use and also recommended recapture of material released already.    There was some discussion at the end of the meeting among attendees about looking at possible rulemaking in a more segregated way, i.e., on a material by material basis as to what alternatives might be acceptable.    The discussions provided useful information which the staff will use as part of developing a paper for the Commission in March 2000. The next public meeting will be held in Chicago, Illinois, on December 7-8, 1999. An Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) meeting is scheduled for the week of December 13, 1999, to discuss ACNW comments on the Issues Paper.    Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant Seismic Modifications    On November 3, 1999, the Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards held a meeting to discuss the ongoing seismic modifications at the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant at Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Headquarters. It was a noticed public meeting between NRC, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC). No member of the general public or press attended. The purpose of the meeting was to resolve scheduling problems for USEC's completion of required seismic modifications for two process buildings at the Paducah facility. USEC is currently operating those buildings under a Notice of Enforcement Discretion until a firm completion date can be incorporated into an amendment request for the compliance plan item requiring the seismic modifications. Completion of the seismic modifications requires USEC's access to DOE controlled areas called DOE Material Storage Areas (DMSAs). These are areas within the process buildings within which DOE has stored material and waste with possible uranium and other radionuclide contamination. The uranium contamination raises nuclear criticality concerns such that access is restricted until the exact amount and enrichment is known through a characterization process. Once characterized, the nuclear criticality risks can be determined and minimized while the seismic modification work is done. DOE presented a schedule for characterization of the DMSA's, which they felt still needed improvement. The schedule is adversely impacted by availability of qualified operators to do the work. DOE and USEC agreed to see if other work can be reprioritized, which would allow additional qualified operators to work on the DMSA's which would help expedite the schedule. USEC committed to provide an optimized schedule for NRC and DOE to review based on USEC's ability to implement the seismic modifications. This schedule is expected in three weeks. USEC, DOE and NRC agreed to convene another open public meeting on November 15, 1999, to review the assumptions USEC would use in developing their optimized schedule.    ABB-Combustion Strike Status    On November 4, 1999, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was informed by ABB-Combustion Engineering, Hematite, Missouri, that the machinists union had voted to accept the company's contract proposal. The outcome of the vote means that the machinists will not join in the teamsters union strike at the facility which began on September 28, 1999. With regard to the current status of the facility, following appropriate training which was observed by the NRC, management staff commenced operation of the major process lines. The licensee initiated startup of the uranium hexafluoride to uranium dioxide conversion line and fuel rod assembly in mid-October. Pelletizing operations began in late October. NRC inspectors will continue to monitor the ongoing activities at the facility.    Abandonment of Wells at the Church Rock Uranium Mill Tailings Site    On October 26, 1999, the Division of Waste Management staff visited the Church Rock Uranium Mill Tailings site near Gallup, New Mexico, to observe the United Nuclear Corporation (UNC) process for abandonment of wells. Roughly 180 wells, which are not part of the current groundwater corrective action program, were approved for abandonment by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) letter dated May 3, 1999, after concurrence by the Environmental Protection Agency, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), and the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency. The NRC letter required that UNC meet well abandonment requirements of the New Mexico State Engineer Office.    The wells are mainly 2 inches in diameter, with some up to 6 inches, and vary from about 20 to 330 feet in depth. The NRC staff, accompanied by staff from NMED, determined that the well abandonment process implemented by UNC, essentially grouting the well casings with bentonite mud, cutting the top of the casing off a few feet below the land surface, and capping the wells, met or exceeded the State Engineer requirements. UNC will prepare and issue a report subsequent to completion of the process.    Public Meeting in Nevada on Repository Defense-in-Depth    On November 2, 1999, Division of Waste Management (DWM) staff hosted a public meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, to discuss the staff's current thinking on repository defense-in-depth. Approximately 60 people attended the meeting including representatives from the state of Nevada; Nye, Clark, Lincoln, and Churchill Counties; Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board; and several state legislators. The meeting was part of the staff's plan for clarifying how defense-in-depth applies to the regulation of a possible repository at Yucca Mountain (see  SECY-99-186 ). With the assistance of a facilitator, the staff conducted a roundtable discussion involving the Department of Energy (DOE), the state of Nevada, and other interested stakeholders. Representatives of the state of Nevada expressed the view that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission should not allow engineered barriers to be relied on to compensate for unsuitable natural features of a repository site. DWM staff indicated that both natural and engineered barriers would have to make significant contribution to waste isolation. Clark County representatives expressed a somewhat similar view that they saw a noticeable shift to more reliance on engineered barriers. DOE representatives stated that they were looking at design changes that would distribute waste containment over multiple barriers.    Department of Energy International Conference on Deep Geologic Repositories    On October 31 through November 2, 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE) hosted an International Conference on Geologic Repositories in Denver, Colorado. The conference highlighted global progress on the management of nuclear materials and waste, and provided a forum to discuss ongoing and planned activities to develop geologic repositories. Commissioner Dicus addressed a plenary session of the group and spoke about the role of the regulator in gaining public confidence. DOE's Secretary Richardson provided the keynote address, and comments were offered to the plenary group by Dr. ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency and by Dr. Echavarri of the Nuclear Energy Agency. The conference included presentations on the status of repository activities from representatives of the Russian Federation, Sweden, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France, China, and the U.K. There were comments from representatives of the National Resources Defense Council and from the International Association for Environmentally Safe Disposition of Radioactive Materials. Attendees at the conference concluded that international cooperation and collaboration might be useful in future work involving repositories.       ENCLOSURE C    Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research  Items of Interest  Week Ending November 5, 1999    Second Meeting on Phenomena Identification and Ranking Tables (PIRTs) for High-Burnup Fuel    The second meeting to develop Phenomena Identification and Ranking Tables (PIRTs) was held at NRC on October 27-29. PIRTs have been used at NRC since 1988 and provide a structured way to get a technical understanding that is needed to address certain issues. About twenty of the world's best technical experts are participating in this activity, and the experts represent a balance between industry, universities, and foreign research and regulatory organizations. The current PIRT activity is addressing the postulated PWR rod ejection accident, which is required to be analyzed in plant safety analyses. The third and final PIRT meeting on this accident will be held on December 7-9, and a draft NUREG report describing results of this activity will be available shortly after that meeting. The identification and ranking of phenomena in that report are expected to help the staff make decisions about specific testing requirements and revised criteria that are needed to analyze high-burnup fuel with a variety of current cladding materials for this postulated accident.    Halden Reactor Project Meeting    On November 1 and 2, the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) and the Halden Reactor Project (HRP) co-sponsored a meeting to describe activities and products from the HRP. The NRC has sponsored the HRP since 1958 to perform research in the areas of fuels and materials, human factors and advanced instrumentation and control systems. The HRP currently has 20 member countries, with members from regulatory bodies as well as industry and research organizations. The NRC uses information from Halden to validate fuels and materials computer codes and as the technical bases for licensee review guidance pertaining to human performance and the man-machine interface. EPRI, GE and ABB are other U.S. sponsors. However U.S. nuclear utilities have generally not been aware of the HRP or its products. The intent of this seminar was to familiarize the U.S. nuclear industry with Halden.    Individual utilities, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), a vendor, and a national laboratory were represented, as well as, RES and NRR. The HRP project manager gave an overview of the HRP and a short presentation on their fuels and materials programs. This was followed by a description of their human factors research and how the computerized operator support systems are evaluated using commercial reactor operators in their research simulator. They also gave a detailed description of their Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory and applications in designing control rooms. The specific systems discussed included systems for: alarm handling, signal monitoring and validation, computerized procedures, event detection, reactor core monitoring and thermal performance monitoring, as well as a tool for developing operator interfaces.    The industry representatives expressed great interest and willingness to use or further validate several of these systems. There was particular interest in the use of VR technology to design hybrid control rooms. There is expected follow-up between specific utilities and the HRP. Also EPRI indicated that they will sponsor a future HRP meeting with members of the Digital I&C and Human Performance committees. There was greatest interest in those systems that could reduce burden and costs.    Utility and industry representatives at the meeting made it clear that these technologies will be employed in hybrid control room applications at current US plants. Participation in these activities prepares the NRC for future applications of these emerging technologies.       ENCLOSURE D    Incident Response Operations  Items of Interest  Week Ending November 5, 1999    Request for assistance involving a transportation incident    Members of IRO, NMSS, OSP and Regions II, III and IV responded under the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) to a request for assistance involving a transportation incident reported to the NRC Operations Center on October 20, 1999, (event report #36323 and PNO-IV-99-A-046A). A shipment of poly liners (removed from waste casks) was being transported from Allied Technology Group, Inc (ATG) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to an ATG facility in Richland, Washington. When the shipment arrived, contamination in the form of resin beads was identified on the outer surface of several of the liners. The states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and Washington were notified and participated in coordination conference calls through the NRC Operations Center. The Department of Energy Radiological Assistance Program provided monitoring assistance to the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Other Federal agencies participating on the conference calls were the EPA and DOT. There was some media interest particularly in Washington and Idaho. All states conducted radiation surveys of likely areas where the truck may have stopped and no traces of radiation above background levels were found. All states agreed to suspend search efforts on Saturday, October 23, 1999.

The proposed rule would provide for the enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 by the participating agencies. Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. The proposed rule would provide guidance to recipients of federal financial assistance who administer education programs or activities. The comment period for this action closes December 28, 1999.    Michael Stein; Receipt of Petition for Rulemaking (PRM-2-12)    A document that requests public comment on a petition for rulemaking submitted by Michael Stein was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 1999 (64 FR 59669). The petitioner believes that NRC regulations pertaining to deliberate misconduct and employee protection do not contain certain needed safeguards. The petitioner requests that NRC amend its deliberate misconduct and employee protection regulations to ensure that all individuals are afforded the right to respond to an NRC determination that the individual has violated these regulations. The comment period on the petition closes January 18, 2000.    Antitrust Review Authority: Clarification (Parts 2 and 50)    A proposed rule that would amend the NRC's regulations to reflect the Commission's limited antitrust review authority more clearly was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 1999 (64 FR 59671). The proposed amendment would explicitly limit the types of applications that must include antitrust information. The comment period on this action closes January 3, 2000.    Clarification and Addition of Flexibility (Part 72)    A proposed rule that would amend the NRC's regulations pertaining to spent fuel storage was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 1999. The proposed rule would specify the provisions of Part 72 that apply to general licensees, specific licensees, applicants for a specific license, certificate holders and applicants for a certificate. The proposed rule would also eliminate the need for repetitious Part 72 specific license hearing reviews of cask design issues that the Commission had previously considered and resolved during the approval of the cask design. The proposed rule would also allow the applicant for a Certificate of Compliance to begin cask fabrication under an NRC-approved quality assurance program before the Certificate of Compliance is issued. The comment period for this action closes January 18, 2000.    Petition for Rulemaking from the State of Nevada; Extension of comment period (PRM-73-10)    A document that extends the public comment period on a petition for rulemaking submitted by the State of Nevada was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 1999 (64 FR 59684). The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations governing safeguards for shipments of spent nuclear fuel against sabotage and terrorism. The petition requested that the NRC conduct a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of specific types of terrorist attacks and modify its regulations accordingly. The comment period for this action has been extended and now closes January 28, 2000.

Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute Meeting (Springhouse, PA)    A Region I staff member attended a meeting at the R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute (an NRC licensee) on October 20, 1999. The meeting was requested by representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III (Philadelphia) Office, who invited representatives of the EPA Office of Solid Waste, the EPA Office of Reinvention, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), and the NRC to discuss a research project the licensee has been performing on high-temperature catalytic oxidation of a mixed waste stream. Although research into this process has been performed since 1992, the licensee recently submitted an application to the EPA for this research activity to become part of the EPA's ""Project XL"". As part of this application, the licensee has requested that the radiolabeled carbon dioxide and water products no longer be considered mixed waste products, but be disposed of as low-level radioactive wastes. The meeting was held to discuss the high-temperature catalytic oxidation process, view the apparatus, and review the options available to the licensee, EPA and PADEP for regulation of this research project and disposal of the mixed waste products.    Health Physics Topical Review    Charles Meinhold, current President of the NCRP, provided a two-day presentation to Region I Health Physicists on Radiation Risk. This Seminar meets the requirements of IMC 1246 for refresher training on a Health Physics Topical Review topic.    Transport of Haddam Neck Steam Domes    During the week of November 1, 1999, two of the four steam domes (the upper portion of the steam generators) were shipped from the Haddam Neck site as part of the decommissioning process. The two domes were transported by road to Portland, CT, and transferred to a rail car for transport to the GTS-Duratek processing facility in Tennessee. The domes contained minimal radioactivity, and did not require special packaging or labeling for radioactive material, but were transported as over-weight and over-size items. Region I inspection activities included evaluating the package and performing independent measurements prior to the shipments leaving the site, and accompanying the shipments to Portland. No radiation above background levels were detected and no problems were identified with the transfers. The licensee notified local elected officials, police and fire departments, and school superintendents, prior to the shipments. The licensee also issued a press release, but media interest was minimal.

Core Shroud Bolts at Cooper Nuclear Station    On November 2, 1999, while operators were removing core shroud bolts from the    spent fuel pool, the cable supporting one of the bolts failed. The licensee    had previously stated that a cable clamp had unfastened. The approximately 300    lb. bolt dropped 10 feet and impacted a ""Tri-Nuke"" brand filter canister,    penetrating the canister and damaging at least one of the filters. Operators    attempted to retrieve the bolt; however, the canister moved with the bolt and    retrieval operations were, therefore, halted. Health physics technicians performing    surveys and water analysis did not detect an increase in radioactivity or radiation    levels.

Firefighters from Goliad in South Texas responded to the Minnehulla Baptist Church in the small community of Minnehulla about 5 p.m. Saturday. The church´s old sanctuary had been set ablaze. Despite efforts by firefighters, the sanctuary was declared a total loss. Agents from the FBI, Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and State Fire Marshal´s Office (SFMO) are investigating the fire.   Early Sunday morning several volunteer fire departments were called to the Old Spring Seat Baptist Church located outside Buffalo in East Texas. SFMO and ATF investigators say suspects entered the church and poured a flammable substance inside before lighting it. The church was destroyed.   Investigators said they have a suspect in one of the fires and the description of a vehicle leaving the scene in the other fire.

Description:  The Indian Point power plant is located          on 239 acres in Buchanan, Westchester County, New York. The original          owner, Consolidated Edison, was one of the first utilities to purchase          their own simulator for training the reactor operators and supervisors          licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In 2001, unit 2 generated          7.75 billion kilowatthours of electricity while operating at 92.9 percent          of capacity.Unit 3 operated at 94.2 percent of capacity and produced          8.01 billion kilowatthours of electricity.Both units are operated by           Entergy           Nuclear  and owned by Entergy Nuclear Operations.                     Sources:  Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the          net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration          (EIA) survey form 860, ""Annual Electric Generator Report."" Capacity Factor          is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net          summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied          by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported          by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial          reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water          reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified          in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line          Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information          Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

GX105-86-6745997	"River Search and Recovery Attempt Claims the Life of One Fire Fighter/SCUBA Diver - Illinois         SUMMARY    On May 19, 1998, one male fire fighter/Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) diver (the victim) assigned to the fire department’s diving squad drowned during a river search in an attempt to recover the bodies of two civilians. The victim and his SCUBA partner, both fully equipped with diving gear and a rope, entered the swift, murky river to assist the fire department’s Air and Sea Rescue divers, who were already in the river. The victim and his partner entered the river at the location where the two civilians were reported to have gone down to perform an independent sweep search pattern. The search lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes at an approximate depth of 25 to 30 feet. Due to zero visibility and the underwater current, the victim and his partner decided to surface and return to the staging area where they changed over to their underwater communication masks and received further instructions from the dive supervisor. Once they returned to the staging area, the dive tender (back-up diver) changed their tanks, assisted with the removal of their gear, provided Gatorade to drink, and placed a 50 foot long, 4-inch round air float (rubber-jacketed fire hose) from shore to the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter that had just arrived. After a brief conversation with the dive supervisor, the divers decided to remove their SCUBA gear and free float to the Coast Guard cutter using the 4-inch float as a guide and flotation device, determining this would be the easiest way to enter the boat since it did not have a swim platform. Wearing his weight belt, the victim began his free float to the boat, holding on to his Buoyancy Control Device (BCD), tank, and the 4-inch air float as flotation devices. The weight belt consisted of three 10-pound lead weights secured around his waist. As the victim was approaching the boat he lost grip of the flotation devices and instantly went under the water due to the 30-pound weight belt that he did not release. His partner immediately went down after him, free diving with just his wet suit which created a buoyancy problem and limited his dive depth. After two attempts to reach the victim, he surfaced and called for assistance from the Air and Sea Rescue divers. One diver from the Air and Sea Rescue team descended to the area where the victim went down and located him. As the victim was pulled close to the water surface, the victim’s partner grabbed him. The Air and Sea diver lost his grip on the victim while adjusting his own equipment, and because of the 30-pound weight belt around the victim’s waist, the victim’s partner was unable to hold on to him, and he descended for a second time. The victim was located and pulled from the water approximately 10 to 15 minutes later by the police rescue divers. The victim received immediate medical attention on shore before being loaded into the Air and Sea Rescue helicopter which transported him to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.    NIOSH investigators concluded that, to prevent similar incidents, fire departments should:        ensure that whenever divers remove     their diving gear, the first piece of equipment to be removed is their weight belt           ensure that divers and their dive     partners complete equipment inspections each time they enter the water           ensure that whenever a dive boat is     being used it is equipped with an adequate diving ladder or platform for the specific     operation.                   INTRODUCTION    On May 19, 1998, a 38-year-old male fire fighter/SCUBA diver (the victim), drowned while attempting to complete a river search and recovery of two missing civilians. The victim and his dive partner, along with Air and Sea Rescue divers, entered the river and completed search patterns before they decided to exit the water and wait for a U.S. Coast Guard Cutter to arrive and assist in the search. Upon arrival of the Coast Guard Cutter, the dive supervisor directed the divers to remove their SCUBA gear and free float to the Coast Guard Cutter after determining this would be the easiest way to enter the boat since it did not have a dive platform. Using their diving gear and a 50 foot long, 4-inch flotation line, the divers started their float. Still wearing his 30-pound weight belt, the victim lost grip on his gear and the 4-inch float and immediately went under the water. The victim was subsequently retrieved from the water and immediately transported to an area trauma center by helicopter where he was pronounced dead.    On June 4, 1998, Frank Washenitz, Safety and Occupational Health Specialist, traveled to Illinois to conduct an investigation of the incident. Meetings were conducted with the Illinois Department of Labor compliance officer, assistant director of training and the director of public relations for the fire department, fire department officers and dive team members who responded to the incident, the vice-president of the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) local union, and the assistant chief medical examiner for the city to review the autopsy report and examine the victim’s weight belt. An additional meeting was conducted with the officers at the air-mask shop. This meeting was conducted to view the equipment that the victim was wearing and the equipment that the department uses. The equipment, consisted of 1 Viking Pro dry suit with boots, hoods and rings for gloves; 1 fin; 1 Dacor vest (BCD); 1 face piece with buddy phone and regulator; a secondary regulator; a Dacor compass gauge and pressure gauge; a SCUBA 80 tank; a Dacor lead weight belt (30 pounds); and a Dacor rechargeable light. These items all appeared to be in good condition and working properly. The Viking Pro dry suit was cut off the victim at the time of the incident, but all valves and seals were checked and appeared to be working properly. Maintenance records from the air-mask shop concerning their SCUBA equipment were also viewed and appeared to be accurate and sufficient.     The fire department involved in the incident serves a metropolitan population of 2.7 million in a geographical area of 224 square miles. The fire department is compromised of approximately 5,000 employees, of whom 4,200 are fire fighters and approximately 100 are certified SCUBA divers (4 squads), which includes Air and Sea Rescue’s divers. The fire department provides all new fire fighters with an extensive 4-month (65-day) training program at their fire department’s training academy. The program covers all aspects of Level I and Level II fire fighter training, as recommended by the National Fire Protection Association. Upon successfully completing academy training and passing the Fire Fighter Level II examination, a fire fighter is assigned to a station. The SCUBA divers from each squad are certified under the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) guidelines and train on a day-to-day basis. The training consist of search and rescue, search and recovery, search patterns, assisting distressed divers, rescue procedures, equipment maintenance, and emergency situations. The SCUBA dive squad trainer is a certified PADI dive instructor. The victim had 3 years of experience as a certified rescue SCUBA diver with the fire department, 10 years as a certified PADI SCUBA diver and 11 years of experience as a fire fighter.            INVESTIGATION    On May 19, 1998, at approximately 1240 hours, Squad 5 received a call from dispatch of two missing civilians in the river. The squad, which consisted of two units, Squad 5 (dive supervisor, two divers and a dive tender) and Squad 5A (two detailed dive assistants), responded to the incident site. As the squads were en route, the victim suited up in his dry suit and his partner suited up in his wet suit. When the squad arrived on scene, two Air and Sea Rescue divers from the fire department were in the water being assisted by a civilian’s pontoon boat as the U.S. Coast Guard was en route to the scene. One of the detailed dive assistants from Squad 5A started clearing a path through heavy brush for the divers to gain access to the river. Soon after, the second detailed dive assistant carried the divers’ gear and supplies to the river’s edge, which was used as the staging area. The dive supervisor (Lieutenant) on Squad 5 surveyed the situation as the two divers, with assistance from the Squad 5 diver tender, donned their equipment. After a quick observation, the dive supervisor guided the two divers to the area where the civilians were reported to have gone down. Both divers submerged under water approximately 25 to 30 feet using the buddy system and began their search. After searching approximately 10 to15 minutes, they decided to return to the staging area and change to their underwater communication masks due to zero visibility and a swift undercurrent. As the two divers returned to the staging area they were met by the detailed dive assistants and the diver tender who assisted them in removing their equipment. Because the water was knee deep at the staging area, the divers decided to sit down rather than exit the water completely. At this point both divers had removed all of their equipment except for the victim, who was still wearing his 30-pound weight belt around his waist. Because they were sitting    in the water, the victim’s dive partner was unable to see that the victim was still wearing his weight belt and did not remind him to remove it. While waiting for the Coast Guard Cutter to arrive, the dive supervisor explained to the divers that they would board the boat and act as the 2 nd  rescue team. The divers then rested at the staging area and were served Gatorade for approximately 10 to 20 minutes. When the Coast Guard Cutter arrived, the dive tender placed an air filled 50 foot long, 4-inch round air flotation device (rubber-jacketed fire hose) in the water from the shore to the Coast Guard boat, as the divers donned their fins and inflated their Buoyancy Control Devices (BCD). As the dive supervisor watched, the Air and Sea Rescue divers attempted to board the Coast Guard Cutter wearing their equipment. He noticed that Air and Sea Rescue divers were having trouble getting on the boat while wearing their equipment because the boat did not have a swim platform. He advised his divers that it would be easier to free float (float with no equipment on) to the Coast Guard boat and hand their equipment to the boat’s crew members. As the victim and his partner started their free float to the Coast Guard boat, the dive supervisor noticed that the victim, who was approximately 15 to 20 feet from the staging area, appeared to be in distress. The dive supervisor asked the victim if he was O.K. Without giving any response, the victim slipped off his BCD and the 4-inch air float and immediately went under water with his 30-pound weight belt still secured around his waist. Thinking that the victim was in distress, the dive supervisor advised the victim’s dive partner to assist him. Neither the dive supervisor nor the victim’s dive partner knew the victim was still wearing his weight belt. The victim’s dive partner descended in the area where the victim went down; however, the dive partner was unable to reach the victim’s depth because the wet suit he was wearing created buoyancy problems. The victim’s dive partner made two rescue attempts before calling the Air and Sea Rescue divers for assistance. A diver from Air and Sea Rescue immediately responded and retrieved the unconscious victim, pulling him close to the water surface with his weight belt still secured around his waist. The victim’s dive partner grabbed the victim by the rubber hood of his dry suit while the Air and Sea Rescue diver attempted to adjust his own equipment. The dive partner was unable to hold on to the victim because of the buoyancy problem created by his wet suit and the victim’s weight belt. The victim slipped out of his dive partner’s grip and descended for a second time. At this point, police rescue divers arrived on scene and joined the Air and Sea Rescue divers to search for the victim. Extensive search efforts on the part of the fire department along with the police department continued for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before police divers located the victim and pulled him to the surface. The victim’s dive partner and the Squad 5 dive supervisor pulled the victim from the water and onto the shore where he received immediate medical attention. The victim did not have a pulse and the decision was made to transport him immediately to an area trauma center. The Air and Sea Rescue helicopter, on the scene (which responded only to assist in the rescue attempt, not for patient transport) was used to transport the victim to a local trauma center as resuscitation efforts continued throughout the flight. The victim was later pronounced dead at the trauma center.     The victim’s dive partner stated that when he finally pulled the victim from the water he pulled him out by his weight belt. He also stated that as they laid the victim on the shore he pulled the weight belt buckle and the weight belt fell off the victim, indicating that the weight belt’s quick release was working properly. The NIOSH investigator also examined the weight belt and determined that it was in proper working condition. It is unclear why the victim did not release his weight belt using the right-hand release method. The autopsy report indicated the victim had a contusion to the back right side of the head, but it is undetermined when the contusion occurred.    The information contained in this investigative report is based upon the facts that were gathered through the NIOSH investigation. Reports of this incident compiled by other investigations may present additional and/or possibly conflicting information from the NIOSH report.            CAUSE OF DEATH    According to the medical examiner, the cause of death was listed as an accidental drowning.            RECOMMENDATIONS / DISCUSSION      Recommendation #1: Fire departments should provide training to ensure that whenever divers remove their diving gear, the first piece of equipment to be removed is their weight belt .    Discussion: Since the weight belt is one of the heaviest pieces of equipment on the diver, it should be the last piece of equipment donned by the diver, and the first piece of equipment removed upon exit from each dive. The weight belt is designed to be placed around the waist and secured by a plastic or metal buckle that can be easily released in an emergency situation. The weight belt should be placed around the waist so that the buckle can be released by the diver’s right hand. This is called the right-hand release and is recommended by PADI.     Divers are equipped with a Buoyancy Control Device (BCD) and a tank of compressed air, which create a buoyancy problem. Weight belts are used to assist divers to reach their dive depths because they can use their BCD to control their buoyancy and assist them when they need to surface. In this incident, the victim removed all of his equipment except his weight belt. When the victim became separated from the 50 foot long, 4-inch air float and his BCD, which he was using as flotation devices, he immediately went under the surface of the water. For reasons unknown, the diver did not use the right-hand release and also could not control his buoyancy without his BCD. For this reason it is recommended that each time divers are to remove their equipment, the first piece of equipment removed should be the weight belt. 1,2             Recommendation #2: Fire departments should ensure that divers and their diver partners complete equipment inspections each time they enter the water.      Discussion: It is recommended by PADI   1,2  that each time a dive is to take place the buddy system should be used. The buddy system consists of two divers who should remain in verbal or physical contact at all times during a dive. The buddy system recommends that for each dive, divers and their buddies should assist each other when donning their equipment. It is also recommended that the divers and their buddies complete an equipment check, ensuring that all their equipment works properly and that all equipment is placed on correctly for the dive. In this incident, the divers were going to be free floating to the Coast Guard Cutter. During this particular assignment the divers were going to remove all of their equipment and hand it up to the Coast Guard crew members when they reached the boat. As the divers removed their equipment, the victim did not remove his weight belt which later caused him to sink under the water. Before divers enter the water, divers and their dive buddies should complete an equipment check to assure that all equipment is working properly or that all equipment is suitable for the particular dive.           Recommendation #3: Fire departments should   ensure that whenever a dive boat is being used, it is equipped with an adequate diving ladder or platform for the specific operation.    Discussion: It is recommended by the Consensus Standards for Commercial Diving Operations 1  that each dive ladder must be capable of supporting the weight of at least two divers, extend 3 feet below the water surface, and be firmly in place. Each diving stage should have an open-grating platform and be available for a diver to enter or exit the water from the dive location while wearing a heavy-weight diving outfit.     In this incident the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter that arrived was described to have a swim platform that is much higher than a dive platform. When the divers from Air and Sea Rescue boarded the boat, they had to use a rope ladder to board the platform which was difficult because they were wearing their equipment. For this reason, the victim and his dive partner were directed to free float to the boat, hand their equipment to the boat’s crew members and board without wearing their equipment.            REFERENCES    1.

Volunteer firefighters from the Huntington, Ora and Fuller Springs Fire Departments were called to fight the fire at the True Light Holiness Church in Huntington.  SFMO arson/fire investigator Glenn Harris declared the fire arson after ruling out accidental ignition.   The FBI and the Huntington Police Department have assisted in the investigation.   The church´s approximately 30 members had planned to remodel and expand the facility.  They had no insurance on the structure.  Huntington is located 25 miles southeast of Lufkin.

In 2001, unit 1 generated 3.35 billion kwh of electricity (capacity factor 72.9 percent). Unit 2 generated 4.56 billion kwh of electricity (capacity factor 99.4 percent). Prairie Island is operated by the  Nuclear Management Company  and owned by Xcel Energy.        Sources:  Capacity, for purposes of this report, is the net summer capability as reported in Energy Information Administration (EIA) survey form 860, ""Annual Electric Generator Report."" Capacity Factor is a calculation in which the maximum possible generation (based on net summer capability) is divided into the actual generation than multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Generation is the electricity output reported by plant owners on EIA survey form 902. Type of Unit: All U.S. commercial reactors currently in operation are one of two types: BWR (boiling water reactor) or PWR (pressurized light water reactor). The type is identified in EIA's Nuclear Power Generation and Fuel Cycle Report. Both the On-line Date and the License Expiration Date are reported annually in Information Digest by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Volunteer firefighters from the Huntington, Ora and Fuller Springs Fire Departments were called to fight the fire at the True Light Holiness Church in Huntington.  SFMO arson/fire investigator Glenn Harris declared the fire arson after ruling out accidental ignition.   The FBI and the Huntington Police Department have assisted in the investigation.   The church´s approximately 30 members had planned to remodel and expand the facility.  They had no insurance on the structure.  Huntington is located 25 miles southeast of Lufkin.   Anyone with knowledge of this fire is asked to contact the SFMO´s new 24-hour toll-free hotline at 1-877-4-FIRE-45.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is issuing this administrative letter to inform addressees of revisions to staff guidance for implementing the NRC's policy on Notices of Enforcement Discretion.    NRC Counterparts Fire Risk Assessment Workshop    On February 17 and 18, 1999, the Plant Systems Branch in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, sponsored an internal workshop on reactor fire risk assessment. The overall purpose of the workshop which was held at NRC Headquarters, Rockville, Maryland, was to develop a method or tool for assessing the risk significance of reactor fire protection deficiencies (e.g., inspection findings). The methodology will be used to address the following needs:      (1)   consistency in understanding and treating fire protection inspection findings (e.g., to support enforcement),   (2)   assessing the safety and risk significance of fire protection functional inspection findings to support the staff's recommendations to the Commission on the future of the Fire Protection Functional Program, and   (3)   establishing a tool or methodology for assessing the risk significance of degraded, reactor plant specific, fire protection and post-fire safe shutdown features.    NRC managers and technical staff (reviewers, inspectors, risk analysts, senior level advisors, and senior reactor analysts) from the following organizations participated in the workshop: Division of Systems Safety and Analysis, Division of Inspection and Support Programs, Plant Systems Branch, Probabilistic Safety Assessment Branch, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, Office of Enforcement, and Regions I, II, III, and IV. A meeting summary will be issued.    San Onofre Units 2 and 3    On February 12, 1999, the NRC issued two final amendments to support the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Unit 2 outage and plant restart. This completes a total of 10 licensing actions to support significant maintenance and plant modifications for Unit 2, with the same number of actions supporting the Unit 3 outage that follows a month after Unit 2 restart.    The actions included extension of emergency diesel generator allowed outage time to allow major maintenance on the EDGs before the outage (completing both a risk-informed, as well as a greater than three year old issue): implementation of Option B to Appendix J for containment isolation valve testing; continued use of mechanical nozzle seal assemblies; an amendment to allow use of ABB/CE sleeves in steam generator tubes; an amendment to allow operation in a manner which reduces thermal stress on steam generator tubes and supports extended life of the steam generators; and correction of a long-standing problem with use of one bistable in the reactor trip circuitry that was used to two different trips.    During the period since October 1, 1998, the staff has completed a total of 36 licensing actions total for both SONGS units, including 4 greater than three years old, and 10 others between 2 and 3 years old. In addition, the staff has responded to 7 allegations or other correspondence from concerned citizens from the SONGS vicinity.    Byron Units 1 and 2    Byron Station implemented the improved Standard Technical Specifications at midnight on February 5, 1999.

Discussion focused on generic cask evaluations under accident conditions, severe accident probabilities, package release fractions, and route modeling. The revalidation project is expected to be completed by the Fall of 1999.    Department of Energy Source Recovery Program    On February 11, 1999, staff members from the Office of Nuclear Material    Safety and Safeguards and the Incident Response Operations met with representatives    from the Department of Energy ( DOE   )    Albuquerque waste operations field office at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission    Headquarters to discuss DOE's source recovery program conducted by the Los Alamos    Laboratory (LANL). The DOE currently accepts certain greater than class C    (GTCC) sealed sources (plutonium-beryllium and americium-beryllium), that meet    specific criteria, for processing by LANL. DOE has also accepted other sealed    sources that do not meet the criteria for more routine acceptance in cases where    the source presents an imminent radiological hazard to the public and no other    options are available to mitigate the hazard.    The DOE representatives discussed a proposal that would allow for increased routine acceptance of a greater number of GTCC sources, source types, and isotopes that can be accepted each year. This could be accomplished through the use of alternative disposition options for the sources, as well as changing the current process for retrieving and accepting sources.    Meeting with Atlas Corporation    On February 12, 1999, the Deputy Executive Director for Regulatory Programs and staff from the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards and the Office of the General Counsel met with representatives of the Atlas Corporation. The staff has been reviewing Atlas' proposal for onsite reclamation of its uranium mill tailings pile near Moab, Utah. The staff issued its Final Technical Evaluation Report on the proposal in March 1997. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) had been delayed awaiting a biological opinion (BO) from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance with the Endangered Species Act. On September 22, 1998, Atlas filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and is in the process of preparing a reorganization plan.    At the meeting, the staff informed Atlas that it could not conclude that the standard for ammonia in the Colorado River, identified in the July 1998 BO, would be met by the Atlas proposal. The staff stated that it plans to issue the FEIS in March with this as an open issue and that it would not be able to approve Atlas' proposed reclamation until this issue was satisfactorily resolved. Atlas stated that it would be unable to provide the additional data and analysis to resolve the open issue because of its financial condition.    Atlas discussed the current situation with respect to options it has been considering to reclaim the site. At an earlier meeting, Atlas had discussed a plan in which a turnkey operator would assume responsibility for managing the reclamation of the site and would also assume the risk of increased reclamation costs. Atlas told the staff that the proposal from the turnkey contractor put such a contract beyond Atlas' financial resources. The options Atlas identified at the meeting all involve transferring money to a trust, with a trustee responsible for site reclamation with a cap on that trustee's liability corresponding to the amount included in the trust. Atlas requested that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission review the options proposed and negotiate with Atlas, as well as with the other interested parties, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and other stakeholders. The staff stated that it needed to discuss the options with the Commission before it could make any commitments.    Meeting with Westinghouse on Proposed License Revision    On February 16, 1999, staff from the Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards met at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Headquarters with nuclear criticality safety experts from the Westinghouse Commercial Fuel Fabrication Facility in Columbia, South Carolina, to discuss responses to technical questions posed by the licensing technical reviewers on a proposed revision to the criticality safety chapter of the Westinghouse license. The technical exchange, for the most part, focused on clarification of criticality safety commitments by the licensee. The outcome of the meeting was an agreement that Westinghouse would resubmit their proposed revision to their license.    Design Basis Threat Issues Meeting    Early in February 1999, staff from the Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards met with members of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Safeguards and Security to discuss Design Basis Threat (DBT) issues. DOE has appointed a new DBT issue coordinator who has a mandate to revisit DBT-related issues and problems, and revitalize its DBT program. DOE is currently in an information-gathering stage, and wanted to meet Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) staff to see how they develop and maintain the DBT for NRC licensees. NRC staff provided DOE with several unclassified studies which led to the current NRC DBT, as well as copies of the classified Semiannual Threat Environment Review. DOE wishes to send several threat personnel to NRC in the near-future to conduct brainstorming sessions in order to improve its DBT and to more closely coordinate DBT issues between the two agencies and the Department of Defense to maintain comparability.    10 CFR Part 70    A letter received early in February 1999 from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that OSHA believes the draft proposed  10 CFR Part 70  rule language addressing chemical hazards preempts OSHA from enforcing their standards, rules, and other requirements with respect to chemical hazards. OSHA further stated that they believe this preemption would extend to other rules relating to hazards from flammable, explosive, corrosive or toxic chemicals, including such things as respiratory protection, confined space entry, and lockout/tagout. OSHA also expressed concerns with the OSHA-NRC Memorandum of Understanding that delineates jurisdiction in a practical way. The Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards and the Office of the General Counsel will be meeting with OSHA representatives on February 25, 1999, to discuss OSHA's concerns.       ENCLOSURE C    Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research  Items of Interest  Week Ending February 19, 1999    Completion of Version 2.0 of the VICTORIA Fission Product Chemistry Code    Version 2.0 of VICTORIA, the NRC's fission product chemistry code, was recently completed. Its code manual was published as NUREG/CR-6131, ""VICTORIA 2.0: A Mechanistic Model for Radionuclide Behavior in a Nuclear Reactor Coolant System Under Severe Accident Conditions,"" December 1998. VICTORIA was developed to mechanistically model fission product behavior and related phenomena in the reactor coolant system of light water reactors. VICTORIA has mechanistic models for the release of fission products (and non-radioactive materials) from the fuel, release of control rod and structural materials, chemical interactions, aerosol formation and interactions, and decay heating effects due to fission product deposition. VICTORIA was recently used in support of the NUREG-1570 study, Risk Assessment of Severe Accident-Induced Steam Generator Tube Rupture, March 1998. Applications of VICTORIA included evaluation of steam generator tube heating by deposited fission products under station blackout conditions. VICTORIA was also used for estimating offsite releases for a postulated steam generator tube rupture.    VICTORIA 2.0 contains significant enhancements over previous versions. These enhancements result in more accurate prediction of the location and mechanism of iodine deposition in the reactor coolant system. These enhancements had as their origin the conclusions of an earlier independent peer review. With the issuance of VICTORIA 2.0, all high priority VICTORIA development is finished. Other VICTORIA-related activities this year include application of the code to operating reactors, assessment of results of the ongoing PHEBUS integral core damage experiments in France, and evaluation of VICTORIA capabilities versus MELCOR, the NRC's integrated full-plant systems code for severe accident analysis.    Regulatory Guides    Two regulatory guides were issued recently. A new  Regulatory    Guide 1.179 , ""Standard Format and Content of License Termination Plans for    Nuclear Power Reactors,"" was developed to provide guidance on developing license    termination plans for nuclear power reactor licensees who wish to terminate    their licenses and release their sites. Revision 1 to  Regulatory    Guide 3.54 , ""Spent Fuel Heat Generation in an Independent Spent Fuel Storage    Installation,"" was issued to present a method that is acceptable to the NRC    staff for calculating heat generation rates for use as design input for an independent    spent fuel storage installation. The procedures in this revised guide, for both    boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors, are simpler and therefore    are expected to be more useful to applicants and reviewers.    Two regulatory guides were withdrawn, Regulatory Guide 10.10, ""Guide for the    Preparation of Applications for Radiation Safety Evaluation and Registration    of Devices Containing Byproduct Material"" (issued March 1987), and Regulatory    Guide 10.11, ""Guide for the Preparation of Applications for Radiation Safety    Evaluation and Registration of Sealed Sources Containing Byproduct Material""    (issued June 1987). The information in Regulatory Guides 10.10 and 10.11 has    been updated and incorporated into  Volume    3 of NUREG-1556 , ""Consolidated Guidance About Materials Licenses; Applications    for Sealed Source and Device Evaluation and Registration,"" which was issued    in July 1998. Since there is no longer a need for Regulatory Guides 10.10 and    10.11, they have been withdrawn.    Assessment of Pressurized Water Reactor Primary System Leaks    The Safety Programs Division, has issued the final report of  Assessment of Pressurized Water Reactor Primary System Leaks,  NUREG/CR- 6582. The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of U.S. experience related to PWR primary system leaks, their rates, and trends; the safety significance of such leakage; and assessment of current leak detection methods. Earlier drafts of this report were provided to the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, the regions, industry organizations, and the public for peer review and comment.    The assessment was mainly based on a review of licensee event reports related to leak events from 1985 to September 1996. Several leak events that took place outside the study period or, in the case of thermal fatigue, outside the United States were reviewed to complement the study. The report presents findings in the following eight areas: (1) trends of annual rates of primary coolant leaks, (2) previously unidentified degradation mechanisms and failure modes that have caused primary coolant leaks, (3) locations and types of leaks not previously identified, (4) leaks that have a potential for relatively rapid growth, (5) safety significance of piping fatigue, (6) leak events that may be regarded as core damage precursors, (7) effectiveness of current leakage detection systems, and (8) information relevant to risk-informed inspection.    Thermal fatigue of PWR branch lines may become an emerging issue for the following reasons: (1) thermal fatigue cracks have occurred in pipe base metal or small pipe weld locations that are generally not inspected and corresponding failure mechanisms are not well understood, (2) the stability of a through-wall crack in small diameter piping ( < 10 inch) under seismic conditions is not well assessed by analysis, (3) experience with a rapidly growing fatigue crack, which has been reported for a safety injection line of Dampierre 1 in 1997, is limited, and (4) the recent leak event at Civaux 1 (leak rate 132 gpm) implies that leakage through a thermal fatigue crack could lead to a small break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA).

ENCLOSURE P    Region I  Items of Interest  Week Ending February 19, 1999    Washington Hospital Center Enforcement Conference    On February 8, 1999, an enforcement conference was held with Washington (D.C.) Hospital Center management at the Region I office. The conference focused on the loss of control of a plutonium-238 nuclear pacemaker. The root cause and contributing causes of the event were discussed. The licensee's planned and implemented corrective and preventive actions were also discussed. Enforcement action is under consideration.    Nine Mile Point (NMP) Unit 1    During the last quarter of 1997, the NMP Unit 1 emergency condenser (EC) tube bundles were replaced due to leaking tubes. Recently, on February 18, Niagara Mohawk (NM) discovered that an ASME-required preservice weld inspection of the tube bundles had not been performed. The preservice inspection required volumetric examinations of 4 welds located on each emergency condenser end bell. The nondestructive examinations (NDE) that were intended to be credited as preservice inspections exams were inappropriately performed prior to, instead of after, hydrostatic testing. This resulted in all four ECs being declared inoperable, which also required the initiation of a technical specifications required shutdown.    Because of the plant impact, NM requested that enforcement discretion be granted to extend the allowed outage time by 48 hours to allow sufficient time to complete the appropriate NDE examinations. NM presented their basis for requesting enforcement discretion during a conference call with the NRC during the evening of February 18. After evaluation of the circumstances and safety basis for NM's request, the NRC granted enforcement discretion at 8:26. p.m.    As of 2:00 p.m. February 19, NMPC was performing the required NDE.

GX033-36-9933046	"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION  U.S. COAST GUARD  STATEMENT OF   REAR ADMIRAL ROBERT C. NORTH   ON   CRUISE SHIP SAFETY  BEFORE THE  SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION   COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE   U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES   OCTOBER 7, 1999     Good morning, Mr. Chairman and distinguished Subcommittee members.  I am Rear Admiral Robert C. North, Assistant Commandant for Marine Safety and Environmental Protection for the United States Coast Guard.  As such, I am responsible for Coast Guard programs that include commercial vessel safety, marine environmental protection, and waterway management.  Our Marine Safety Directorate’s mission statement is to  protect the public, the environment and U.S. economic interests through the prevention and mitigation of maritime incidents...""protecting people from the sea, and the sea from people.""   In support of this, we have a strategic goal to ""Eliminate deaths, injuries and property damage associated with commercial maritime operations,"" and subordinate performance goals focused specifically on passenger vessels.  The performance goals are supported by a strategy that states, ""Develop plans and implement procedures to prevent the occurrence of a mass personnel casualty incident involving a passenger vessel.""  In short, passenger vessel safety is a very high concern for us.    There are three main groups of passenger vessels operating in the U.S.: foreign registered, oceangoing cruise ships on international voyages; U.S. small passenger vessels on international voyages; and U.S. vessels on oceangoing and inland domestic voyages.  Today I will focus on the oceangoing vessels.    Our passenger vessel safety program is carried out through a regime of international and domestic safety standards.  Compliance programs ensure that vessels meet these standards.  Our standards development began back in the mid-1800s and continues today.  It is a continuous improvement process of incorporating new technology, lessons learned, and knowledge gained from casualty investigations, practical experience, and research and development projects.  Much of the history of the regulation of maritime safety has been reactive - disasters followed by legislation.  Maritime safety has transitioned from the historical ""reactive"" approach to today’s proactive, systematic, risk-based approach, exemplified by the Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993, which focused on passenger vessels evading inspection through charter arrangements.  The risk posed by these vessels was recognized before casualties occurred, and action was taken to prevent casualties.    Risk can be defined as the product of probability of an accident occurring and the consequences if it does occur.  Our most complex challenge is considering the low probability but very high consequence event.  An example of this would be a cruise ship accident that may put a large number of people at risk, far at sea.  The passenger vessel safety record is very good, but we still consider our ability to prevent, and, if necessary, respond to a major passenger vessel casualty at sea as a very high priority.     Our standards address both variables in the risk equation: the probability that something will go wrong and the resulting consequences should it occur.  Our approach is to reduce the probability of an accident through prevention programs and continual improvement of our response capability.      Fire protection and stability standards decrease the likelihood that a vessel will have to be abandoned if a casualty occurs, and increase the time available when evacuation becomes necessary.  But we cannot become complacent and fail to be prepared in the event that a ship must be evacuated at sea.  Coast Guard resources must be able to conduct offshore search and rescue operations reliably, which are potentially the most difficult operations we are called upon to perform.      Our ""Deepwater"" recapitalization of cutters, aircraft, and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, sensors, and reconnaissance) assets together with our National Distress and Response System modernization project are essential to maintaining that capability.  The evacuation of the cruise ship Prinsendam in 1980 highlighted the amount of resources required to rescue the passengers and crew of a large cruise ship when an accident occurs in a deepwater environment.  When the Prinsendam suffered an engineroom fire 330 miles southeast of Valdez, Alaska, 519 passengers and crew were evacuated without injury by Coast Guard helicopters and boats. The mission included 13 aircraft, 3 Coast Guard cutters, and 3 commercial vessels, and was coordinated by the Seventeenth Coast Guard District operations center.  The PRINSENDAM's captain gave the order to abandon the ship at 5:12 AM, leaving 50 crewmembers on board to continue fighting the fire.  Helicopters began delivering additional firefighting equipment to the crew and hoisting passengers from lifeboats to arriving ships at 9:30 AM.  The rescue went on throughout the day in deteriorating conditions and was completed at 2:00 AM the following morning.  The PRINSENDAM eventually sank.     In July 1998, the cruise ship ECSTASY experienced a fire off Miami, threatening the nearly 3,500 people on board.  We were fortunate that the fire was contained quickly in coastal waters and no evacuation was required.  But given the number of passengers, this had the potential to be a far more complex rescue effort than that involving the PRINSENDAM.  This concern will be elevated as cruise ship capacity continues to grow.    Standards to reduce risk are applied to vessels, associated equipment, and manning of vessels.  They may be international regimes developed through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), where the United States has provided strong leadership (through the Coast Guard as the lead agency) since 1948.  They may be domestic regulatory projects developed with full public involvement under provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act.  They may also be based on classification society rules.  The standards apply to construction, outfitting, manning, and the management of vessels.  The principal international convention dealing with passenger safety is the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, and its Protocol of 1978 (SOLAS 74/78), which includes standards for watertight subdivision and stability, fire protection, lifesaving equipment, and navigation safety.  Two other major international instruments that have had the greatest impact in recent years on vessel management and crew competence, are the International Management Code for the Safe Operations of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (International Safety Management (ISM) Code) and the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).  ISM governs the management of the vessels and applies to all passenger vessels on international voyages; that is, any passenger vessel carrying more than 12 passengers sailing from a U.S. port to a foreign port.  STCW governs mariner licensing and the manning of vessels that make seagoing voyages.    The STCW convention requires that all officers and those ratings designated to assist passengers in emergency situations must be trained in crowd management and communication.  This training is required to be repeated every 5 years.     As I mentioned earlier, many of these standards have their roots in vessel casualties.  For example, the burning of the GENERAL SLOCUM in New York's East River on June 15, 1904 and the subsequent loss of 1,020 persons on board led to more stringent standards for lifesaving and firefighting equipment and the training of crewmembers.    The fire aboard the passenger vessel Morro Castle in 1934 led to the development of structural fire protection criteria.  Many structural fire protection standards have also been the result of research and development.  Studies in that area are being carried out today at the Coast Guard's Fire and Safety Test Detachment in Mobile, Alabama, as well as by independent laboratories.      Recent accidents show us just how well these standards work to protect the safety of passengers and also identify areas of improvement.  In July 1998, the Ecstasy experienced a fire, which started in the laundry room and spread to the aft mooring deck. Structural fire protection, an on-board   sprinkler system, and crew response helped to keep the fire localized to the mooring deck area.  The incident, however, revealed some areas for standards improvement related to the mooring deck area.    The Coast Guard has taken a leadership role in the international arena, where projects are underway to continue the improvement of standards and the application of technology.  There are several projects being pursued at IMO.  One project is the revision of the SOLAS fire protection chapter, to be completed by IMO in 2000.  This incorporates interpretations agreed upon over the past five years, eliminates many vague SOLAS phrases, such as ""to the satisfaction of the Administration,"" and reorganizes the chapter into a more user-friendly document in order to achieve a more consistent application of SOLAS among different nations.  Another project is the development of new inspection and test procedures for lifesaving equipment, which will also address remaining differences in domestic and international regulations.  An IMO subcommittee is also looking into improving ship subdivision and damage stability standards to minimize flooding and prevent capsizing of vessels.  Other initiatives being pursued at IMO are related to passenger evacuation analysis, search and rescue planning, and crew training and watchkeeping.  At the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Coast Guard is spearheading the development of new international standards for safety equipment not currently covered by IMO.    The Coast Guard has in place a robust enforcement regime to ensure foreign flag passenger cruise ships comply with U.S. and international standards.  Our involvement begins early, while a ship design is still in the conceptual stage.  Ship owners, designers, and class societies travel to our offices and present their concept plans to us for every new or refurbished ship that they plan to operate in the U.S. market.  We review their plans for strict compliance to SOLAS regulations.  Our inspectors visit the vessels during construction to ensure that fire safety, lifesaving, and egress requirements are being built into the ship in accordance with our ""approved"" drawings.    When the ship is completed, but before delivery, a team of our inspectors visits the ship once more at the shipyard for what we call the Initial Control Verification Examination (ICVE).  The continuation of the ICVE occurs when the vessel makes its first port of call in the U.S.; at that time, we conduct drills and check crew competency before issuing a certificate to the vessel.    Once the ship enters service, we inspect the vessel every three months.  During these inspections, we again focus on crew competency as required by STCW and operational procedures related to safety and pollution prevention.  The Coast Guard assesses crew communication skills in a number of different ways.  This is done by observing crew operation and teamwork during abandon ship and fire drills.  Coast Guard inspectors walk around the ship and question crewmembers that are stationed at various locations such as passenger corridors, muster stations, embarkation stations, fire stations, and lifeboat stations.  Each such designated crewmember must be able to satisfy the inspector in understandable English that he/she is familiar with evacuation procedures and his/her role in the process.  The inspectors will also question crewmembers at random that are not assigned any fixed duties.  These crewmembers are not required to speak English, but it is expected that a large majority will do so.  However, the crew is evaluated as part of a total general assessment based on the Coast Guard's past experience with similar ships and crews, and the ship may be detained if the inspectors feel that the crew's communication skills are inadequate.  The annual examination is more exhaustive than the quarterly examinations and additionally focuses on proper functioning of all safety equipment and pollution equipment on board as required by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 78 (MARPOL 73/78).    Over the years, international and domestic U.S. standards have been harmonized so that today there is an equivalent level of safety between U.S. and foreign flag vessels operating from U.S. ports.  Beyond basic safety, there has been concern expressed over the medical care for passengers on board passenger vessels.  Most, if not all, ocean-going passenger vessels provide a doctor and medical facilities aboard their vessels for the safety of their passengers, despite there being no international or domestic requirements for licensed medical personnel aboard passenger vessels.  This voluntary step above the requirements, combined with modern communications technology (satellite phones, instant x-ray imaging, satellite faxes), provides a cushion of medical safety for the cruising public.  STCW also contains requirements for all crewmembers to have basic first aid training, with two additional levels of emergency medical training for select personnel.     Similarly, the Coast Guard will be partnering with other Federal agencies and nonfederal stakeholders, including the private sector and state and local entities, in the forthcoming implementation of the recommendations contained in Secretary of Transportation Slater's September 9, 1999 report to Congress, ""An Assessment of the U.S. Marine Transportation System.""    Another area of concern is the level of sanitation aboard passenger vessels.  Oversight of sanitary conditions on passenger vessels is the responsibility of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). The USPHS conducts both scheduled and surprise inspections of passenger vessels in U.S. ports. The inspections focus on proper sanitation for drinking water, food storage, food preparation and handling, and general cleanliness. The USPHS will provide the public with results of inspections on individual vessels, and take reports of unsanitary conditions on individual vessels.    Attention has been given lately to reports of crimes committed on various cruise ships. Generally, the Coast Guard and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed on passenger vessels on the high seas if:          The vessel is U.S. flag, or   The crime occurs in the territorial sea (usually within 12 nautical miles), or   The victim or perpetrator is a U.S. citizen and vessel departed from or will arrive at a U.S. port.       Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter K (33 CFR 120.220), entitled ""Security of Vessels,"" requires vessels under U.S. jurisdiction to report unlawful acts that occur on board to the Coast Guard and to the FBI.  Recent polling of Coast Guard Marine Safety Offices indicates that few crimes have been reported.  Coast Guard and FBI officials recently met to discuss the subject and review the 1980 Coast Guard/FBI Memorandum of Understanding.  We are working with vessel owners to address this issue and ensure that crimes are reported and appropriate follow-up initiated.     Similar to safety, the Coast Guard's pollution prevention program is based upon a regulatory regime for vessel design and equipment, operation, and operational practices.  Several pieces of legislation dating back to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA) provide the Coast Guard with the necessary authority to ensure our waterways are protected.  Under these acts and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (the U.S. implementation of the international treaty MARPOL 73/78), the Coast Guard promulgated a set of comprehensive pollution prevention regulations for ships which include inspection and compliance programs, procedural and personnel requirements, and operational requirements.     A recent pollution case that has received a great deal of attention is that of illegal dumping by Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCCL).  The focus on the RCCL began in October 1994 when Coast Guard aircraft observed oil being discharged from an RCCL vessel off Puerto Rico.  From that time forward, personnel from Coast Guard Marine Safety Offices and the Coast Guard Investigative Service have worked to uncover the full extent of RCCL's violations of environmental laws and regulations, including falsified oil record books.  Cases have been brought against RCCL in six different Federal jurisdictions.    Under various plea agreements, RCCL has agreed to pay a total of $27 million in criminal fines. Additionally, the company must cooperate with our continuing investigation of individuals responsible for the violations and operate under a court supervised environmental compliance plan during a 5-year probation period.  This case would not have been brought forward without the hard work and cooperative effort of many agencies, and the United States Attorneys from all six districts.  Other agencies involved in this complex case include the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Transportation Office of the Inspector General.      Environmental enforcement is another area where the Coast Guard's re-capitalization effort that I mentioned earlier is needed to allow us to continue to improve our ability to detect violations of pollution laws and regulations in our coastal waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone consistent with international law.     The Coast Guard believes that the most important initiative for enhancing safety and pollution prevention for the next decade and beyond will be cooperative industry/government partnerships that address the human element.  Human element problems are related to about 80 percent of all vessel casualties and resulting pollution.  The Coast Guard has led the way on both the national and international fronts to emphasize the human element.    In an effort to address the human element in a nonregulatory manner, the Coast Guard developed a strategy commonly termed ""Prevention Through People"" (PTP).  This strategy has received wide acceptance by the maritime industry in general, and by the passenger vessel industry in particular.  A key tenet of PTP is the use of risk-based decision making.  Risk-based decision making is a process consisting of risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication.  It is a tool Coast Guard Marine Safety Offices use to evaluate and manage activities in their ports to improve safety by reducing accidents.  Another useful tool is the development of partnerships with industry to address specific issues in a nonregulatory manner.  Under our partnership with the Passenger Vessel Association, we have jointly developed guidance for the small passenger vessel owners and operators of the U.S. to use when applying risk-based approaches to their operations.  This guide has been very well received by the industry and the Coast Guard Marine Safety Offices.  One of the most active partnerships currently is with the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL).  This partnership is looking at numerous issues related to accident preparedness and response, including the issues of personal flotation devices for infants and   passenger evacuation.  We conduct periodic evacuation exercises with ICCL members.    In summary, the Coast Guard is very concerned about passenger vessel safety.  We have been heavily involved for over a century in the development of domestic and international standards.  We have an aggressive enforcement program, which is second to none.  But, we are not satisfied and continue to enhance our efforts through research and development, increased use of risk methodologies to identify the most probable causes of accidents and how to mitigate the consequences, and partnerships with vessel operators to improve their safety posture and to plan jointly for emergencies.  These collective efforts have achieved a remarkably low casualty rate for ships operating out of U.S. ports.  But, we are not content to maintain the status quo…we are determined to improve cruise ship safety and compliance even more.    Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue with you today.  I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

GX237-20-6298944	"Federal Transit Administration Transit Threat Level Response Recommendation FTA Policy Statement The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has developed a National Transit Response Model that supports the initiatives of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS). The plan is a guide for the FTA's response to the OHS Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). The Transit Threat Level Response Recommendation, in turn, provides guidance to the U.S. transit industry in responding to the various OHS threat level designations.  Introduction and Background The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), in response to the Office of Homeland Security (OHS), has defined the following plan to guide transit response to the HSAS as defined in Homeland Security Presidential Directive #3. The plan establishes a consistent and coordinated transit response to potential threats in order to protect transit passengers, employees, and infrastructure, and to support community emergency response efforts. Further, the plan is compatible with the way transit operates:  Transit relies on an inherently open architecture, allowing free movement of passengers in public facilities and vehicles. This freedom of movement must be maintained to permit transit to perform its basic functions. Transit is geographically widespread, often operating on public infrastructure and requiring important interagency cooperation to ensure protection. There is great diversity in how police and security forces are provided and deployed at different transit systems. There is no national mandate to standardize this facet of transit operations and security force policies will remain a local agency decision. Transit functions include substantial differences in equipment, infrastructure, operations and security practices from agency to agency. While this plan provides general guidance for response to individual threat conditions, the details of specific implementation vary substantially throughout these agencies. Transit systems are routinely under surveillance by their operating staff (e.g., drivers, supervisors, station attendants, and controllers), security employees, and, with increasing frequency, transit passengers. This normal level of vigilance, supplemented by          appropriate awareness training and the protective measures identified under threat condition green/blue, may be sufficient vigilance for some systems.  Threat Level/Attack/Recovery Systems Approach The FTA National Transit Response Model supplements the existing HSAS Threat Condition model with Black and Purple designations to further define appropriate transit industry activities when an attack is in progress and during the post-event recovery of transit services and facilities.  Color Green Blue Yellow Orange Red Black Purple  Condition Low threat level General threat level Elevated threat level High threat level Severe threat level Actual Attack Recovery  The Black and Purple designations are interpreted as follows.  Black indicates that an attack is underway against a specific transit agency or within the agency's immediate geographic area. The Black state is entered only when an attack has occurred. Black includes the immediate post-attack time period when the transit agency may be responding to casualties, assisting in evacuations, inspecting and securing transit facilities, or helping with other tasks directed by the local emergency management authority. Purple indicates the recovery of transit service after an attack has occurred. Purple includes restoration of levels of service, routes, and schedules, repairing or reopening facilities, adjustment of staff work schedules and duty assignments, responding to customer inquiries about services, and other activities necessary to restore transit service. The Purple state follows the Black state and may also exist for short time periods when the agency is transitioning from a higher threat condition to a lower threat condition (e.g., from Red to Orange). The Purple state will coexist with the prevailing threat condition. In other words, business recovery (Purple) will be accomplished while maintaining the prevailing readiness status (e.g., Orange protective measures).    2   Threat Level Information The Attorney General makes the decision to change the OHS threat level. Changes in threat levels typically will be in sequential stepwise order. As conditions warrant, elevated threat levels will typically progress in order from lowest (green) to highest (red). Likewise, as conditions warrant, returning from higher to lower threat levels will typically progress sequentially. Transit response posture may vary depending on the nature of the threat level. For example, threat guidance focused on the northeastern region may dictate that transit agencies in that region maintain a higher response posture than other regions of the country. If the guidance is modalbased, for example a threat to subways and transit agencies with subway modes may maintain a higher response posture than agencies without subways. In fact, large multi-modal transit agencies may operate their different modes with different response postures. However, based on information and conditions, transit agencies should be prepared for the distinct possibility of a non-sequential threat level advisory. For example, if information and conditions warrant, a current threat advisory level of ""Yellow"" could be directly elevated to ""Red."" Transit agencies must work collaboratively with their local and regional emergency management organizations, joint terrorism task force, police agencies, and other organizations. Each transit agency is responsible for determining its own appropriate response posture, based on an assessment of the guidance received from all sources and the response posture of the communities where the agency provides service.  3   FTA Recommended Protective Measures/Activities for Transit Agencies The FTA recommends the threat level protective measures and activities for transit agencies as suggested or recommended actions, not required actions. While each transit agency should implement measures/activities appropriate to its own operating environment, the following general guidelines apply:     The threat/risk goes up with each successive level. Responses are additive; each level incorporates all activities from the previous levels. Threat information may be general or indicated for different geographical regions of the country, metro areas, cities, transit agencies, industries, facility types (e.g., subway, tunnel, bus, control center, etc.), or for a specific facility. Specific implementation must be determined by the transit agency in light of actual events; protective measures for a higher level than officially designated may be implemented by the transit agency. For example, if the threat advisory level is elevated from ""Yellow"" to ""Orange"" a transit agency may elect to implement not only ""Orange"" level suggested protective measures, but also some ""Red"" level protective measures.  The following table presents specific transit industry protective measures in response to the HSAS threat level conditions, as well as for the actual attack and post-attack/recovery phases.  4   FTA Recommended Transit Protective Measures: GREEN Low Condition (Green). This condition is declared when there is a low risk of terrorist attacks. Measure 1. Measure 2. Refining and exercising as appropriate preplanned Protective Measures. Ensuring personnel receive proper training on the Homeland Security Advisory System and specific preplanned department or agency Protective Measures. Institutionalizing a process to assure that all facilities and regulated sectors are regularly assessed for vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks, and all reasonable measures are taken to mitigate these vulnerabilities. All contractors and visitors must check or sign in and out of designated facilities or areas within the facility that are considered key command, control or communications centers or areas. Ensure existing security measures are in place and functioning such as fencing, locks, camera surveillance, intruder alarms, and lighting. Identify those additional security measures and resources that can enhance the security at the higher Threat Condition levels, e.g., increased surveillance. Establish local, regional and system-wide threat and warning dissemination process, emergency communications capability, and contact information with law enforcement and security officials, including local FBI Field Offices, first responders, regional and district US DOT and FTA representatives. Emergency communications should have redundancy in both hardware and means to contact security officials, law enforcement agencies, and mobile field command centers. Develop terrorist and security awareness and provide information and educate employees on security standards and procedures. Caution employees not to talk with outsiders concerning their facility or related issues. Advise all personnel at each facility to report the presence of unknown personnel, unidentified vehicles, vehicles operated out of the ordinary, abandoned parcels or packages, and other suspicious activities.
